## Scope and Limitations

### What the Assistant Can Do

The assistant is designed to be a **retrieval system**, not a creative or inferential system. It can only answer questions based on information that has been explicitly added to its knowledge base through document uploads, text input, or web crawling.

The assistant's primary focus areas include:
- Sales-focused company information
- Product details and specifications
- Pricing and packaging information
- Customer stories and use cases
- Competitive landscape
- Basic sales processes and methodologies

### What the Assistant Cannot Do

It's important to understand what the assistant cannot do:
- **Cannot access real-time data**: The system has no internet access and cannot look up current information
- **Cannot infer missing information**: If information isn't in the knowledge base, it cannot be derived
- **Cannot provide subjective opinions**: While it can present documented comparisons, it cannot make subjective judgments
- **Cannot predict future events**: It cannot speculate about future company performance, market changes, etc.
- **Cannot access information not in its knowledge base**: The system is limited to what you teach it

### Information Boundaries

"My company" in this context refers to information within these boundaries:
- Officially published company information
- Internal sales documentation
- Approved product and pricing information
- Public customer testimonials and case studies
- Documented competitive information

Information outside these boundaries (e.g., detailed financial data, HR policies, internal IT operations) is not within scope unless specifically added to the knowledge base.

## System Architecture

The Sales Knowledge Assistant uses a modern RAG architecture with several enhancements:

| Core Company Info | Highest | Values, mission, leadership |
| Pricing & Plans | High | Pricing tiers, licensing models |
| Product Features | High | Feature descriptions, specifications |
| Sales Materials | Medium-High | Pitch decks, battle cards |
| Case Studies | Medium | Customer stories, testimonials |
| Blog Content | Low-Medium | Thought leadership, product updates |
| External Sources | Low | Industry reports, news mentions |

When conflicting information exists in the knowledge base, sources with higher priority will take precedence in responses.

### Content Lifecycle Management

#### Adding New Content

For adding new content, use one of these methods:

**Web Interface (Small Additions)**
1. Navigate to the home page
2. Click "Train Assistant"
3. Upload a file or use text input
4. Provide a descriptive title/source

**Command Line (Bulk Processing)**
```bash
# Process web crawl data
node scripts/enhanced_process_web_crawl.js

# Add core information
node scripts/add_core_info.js

# Full reprocessing
node scripts/full_reprocess.js
```

#### Updating Content

To update existing information:

1. **Identify outdated content** through feedback logs or regular audits
2. **Remove obsolete documents** if needed using the reset_vector_store.js script
3. **Add updated information** using standard ingestion methods
4. **Verify the update** by testing queries related to the updated content

#### Removing Content

Currently, content removal requires:
1. Running `scripts/reset_vector_store.js` to clear the entire vector store
2. Re-adding only the content you wish to keep

Future versions will support selective content removal.

### Content Audit Process

Implement a quarterly content audit:

1. **Review feedback logs** for unanswered or poorly answered questions
2. **Evaluate coverage** of essential knowledge domains
3. **Test standard questions** from each domain
4. **Update priority content** based on business changes
5. **Document audit findings** for future reference

Assign domain owners for each content area to maintain information freshness.

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

| Task | Frequency | Responsibility |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Content audit | Quarterly | Sales Enablement |
| Knowledge gap filling | As needed | Domain Owners |
| Feedback log review | Monthly | Admin |
| System performance check | Monthly | IT/Admin |
| Full reprocessing | Bi-annually | IT/Admin |

### User Feedback Loop

The system logs all queries and responses in `feedback.json`. Use this data to:
1. Identify common questions without good answers
2. Discover new topics to add to the knowledge base
3. Improve existing content based on user needs
4. Understand usage patterns and prioritize improvements

To review feedback:
1. Access the Admin Dashboard at `/admin`
2. Review logs chronologically or use search
3. Export logs for further analysis if needed
4. Note patterns for content updates

### System Health Monitoring

Monitor these key indicators:
- Query response time
- Error rate in logs
- Feedback sentiment
- Vector store size
- Content coverage metrics

## Testing and Evaluation

### Test Categories

Testing should cover these key areas:
1. **Document Processing Tests**: Verify format handling and analysis
2. **Query Analysis Tests**: Ensure understanding of different query types
3. **Retrieval Accuracy Tests**: Confirm relevant information retrieval
4. **Response Quality Tests**: Evaluate response format and correctness
5. **Edge Case Tests**: Test behavior with unusual inputs

### Test Scenarios

For each knowledge domain, develop test scenarios:
- Simple factual questions
- Complex multi-part questions
- Questions requiring specific formats (lists, steps)
- Questions that should acknowledge limitations
- Ambiguous questions requiring clarification

### Continuous Testing Script

Basic test suite command:
```bash
node scripts/run_test_suite.js
```

This runs predefined queries and evaluates responses against expected outputs.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Error: "Failed to parse response from AI model"
- **Cause**: The structured output format from the AI model may be inconsistent
- **Solution**: The system has fallback mechanisms for parsing failures; no action needed unless persistent

#### Error: "Vector store is empty"
- **Cause**: No content has been added or the vector store was reset
- **Solution**: Add content using the web interface or command-line tools

#### System returns "I don't have enough information"
- **Cause**: The relevant information is not in the knowledge base
- **Solution**: Add the missing content using one of the ingestion methods

#### Slow response times
- **Cause**: Large vector store or complex query processing
- **Solution**: Consider optimizing chunks, using more specific queries, or implementing the database migration

#### Contradictory or outdated information
- **Cause**: Multiple versions of the same information exist in the knowledge base
- **Solution**: Perform a content audit, remove outdated information, and add updated content

### Getting Help

For additional assistance:
- Review the error logs in the console output
- Check the GitHub repository for updates and known issues
- Contact the system administrator for persistent problems

## Data Processing and Rate Limiting

### Processing Crawled Data

The system includes a script for processing crawled data and extracting metadata using LLMs. This script can be found at `scripts/process_crawl_data.ts`. When running this script, you may encounter API rate limits from both OpenAI and Google's Gemini APIs.

#### Rate Limit Handling

The metadata extraction process has been enhanced with the following features to handle rate limits gracefully:

1. **Exponential Backoff**: Automatically retries failed API calls with increasing delays
2. **Model Fallbacks**: Switches between Gemini and OpenAI models when rate limits are encountered
3. **Batch Processing**: Processes documents in smaller batches with configurable delays
4. **Resumable Processing**: Saves state between runs so you can stop and resume processing

#### Running the Processing Script

To process crawled data with rate limit protection:

```bash
# Basic usage
npx ts-node scripts/process_crawl_data.ts [path_to_crawl_data]

# With custom batch size (smaller = less chance of rate limits)
npx ts-node scripts/process_crawl_data.ts --batch-size 3

# With custom delay between batches in milliseconds
npx ts-node scripts/process_crawl_data.ts --batch-delay 10000

# Specify which model to use for extraction (gemini or gpt-4)
npx ts-node scripts/process_crawl_data.ts --model gemini
```

For large datasets, we recommend:
- Setting a small batch size (3-5 documents)
- Using longer delays between batches (10,000ms or more)
- Running the script during off-peak hours
- Monitoring the logs for rate limit errors and adjusting accordingly

The script will automatically save its progress, so if it encounters persistent rate limits, you can stop it and resume later when API quotas have reset.

#### API Key Management

To avoid rate limit issues:
- Make sure your API keys are properly set in your `.env` file
- Consider upgrading to higher tier API plans if processing large amounts of data
- Use the fallback mechanisms built into the system when possible
