# Sales Knowledge Assistant Enhancement Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the implementation plan for enhancing our Workstream Knowledge Assistant with real-time information capabilities, intelligent data prioritization, and analytics features. By integrating external data sources with our internal knowledge base, we'll create a comprehensive sales enablement tool that delivers accurate, timely information tailored to each sales scenario.

> **Note: The Perplexity API integration for real-time company information has been fully implemented. See the Technical Documentation for implementation details.**

The system features two distinct chat modes:
1. **Base Chat Mode**: General product and company information ✓ (Implemented)
2. **Company-Specific Chat Mode**: Targeted interface preloaded with prospect company intelligence ✓ (Implemented)

## Strategic Objectives

1. **Enhanced Lead Intelligence**: Provide sales representatives with current, accurate information about prospects ✓ (Implemented)
2. **Contextual Product Matching**: Automatically match Workstream products to company-specific needs ✓ (Implemented)
3. **Tailored Recommendations**: Generate customized responses that highlight relevant Workstream solutions ✓ (Implemented)
4. **Seamless User Experience**: Integrate the functionality in a way that feels natural within the existing chat interface ✓ (Implemented)
5. **Conversation Preparedness**: Enable sales reps to begin conversations with comprehensive company context ✓ (Implemented)
6. **Real-Time Information Access**: Ensure access to up-to-date information about Workstream (hiring status, latest product updates, etc.)
7. **Information Quality Metrics**: Gather and analyze feedback on response quality to continuously improve the system
