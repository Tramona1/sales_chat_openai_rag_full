# Code Maintenance Actions

## Import and Type Compatibility Fixes - July 2024

### Changes to `scripts/process_crawl_and_store.ts`

#### Issues Addressed:
1. Removed outdated imports from langchain packages that were causing errors
2. Fixed incorrect import from `supabaseAdmin` to `getSupabaseAdmin`
3. Removed non-existent module imports
4. Fixed conflict between imported and locally defined `DocumentCategoryType` enum
5. Resolved type mismatch between `DocumentLevelContext` and `DocumentContext`
6. Switched from OpenAI to Gemini 2.0 Flash for document analysis

#### Implementation Details:

1. **Import Cleanup**:
   - Removed imports from legacy packages: `langchain/documents`, `langchain/vectorstores/faiss`, `langchain/embeddings/openai`, and `langchain/text_splitter`
   - Replaced `supabaseAdmin` import with the correct `getSupabaseAdmin` function
   - Removed imports for non-existent modules: `../utils/documentClassification` and `../utils/textNormalization`
   - Removed OpenAI import and client initialization

2. **Type Conflict Resolution**:
   - Removed locally defined enums that conflicted with imports: `DocumentCategoryType`, `IndustryCategory`, `PainPointCategory`, `TechnicalFeatureCategory`, and `ValuePropositionCategory`
   - Updated the `DocumentContext` interface to use string arrays instead of enum arrays for certain properties
   - Added a conversion function `convertToDocContext` to transform `DocumentLevelContext` to `DocumentContext`

3. **Dynamic Imports**:
   - Adjusted dynamic imports in the `rebuildVectorStore` function to avoid duplication with static imports

4. **LLM Switch from OpenAI to Gemini**:
   - Replaced OpenAI's `chat.completions.create` with Gemini's `generateStructuredGeminiResponse`
   - Updated `getDocumentLevelContextFromLLM` to use Gemini 2.0 Flash model
   - Added properly structured JSON schema for the response
   - Improved error handling for the Gemini API responses

This maintenance ensures the code compiles correctly and maintains type safety while using the document processing pipeline. The changes were focused on fixing structural issues without modifying the core business logic of the data processing. 

The switch to Gemini 2.0 Flash provides better consistency with the rest of the application which already uses Gemini for embeddings and other generative tasks.
