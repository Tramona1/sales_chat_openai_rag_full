# Gemini AI Integration

## Overview

This document details the integration of Google's Gemini AI models into our metadata extraction pipeline for the sales team's RAG system. The integration provides significant cost savings compared to OpenAI models while maintaining high-quality metadata extraction.

## Models Used

- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: Primary model for metadata extraction. Offers an excellent balance of quality, speed, and cost-effectiveness.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Fallback model used when Gemini encounters processing issues or for complex documents requiring advanced understanding.

## Key Benefits

1. **Cost Reduction**: Gemini 2.0 Flash provides significant cost savings compared to GPT-4, with pricing approximately 10x lower per token.

2. **Comparable Quality**: Testing has demonstrated that Gemini extracts high-quality metadata, with similar or sometimes more detailed entity extraction compared to OpenAI models.

3. **Processing Speed**: Average metadata extraction time is 2-3 seconds per document with Gemini 2.0 Flash.

4. **Reliability**: The system includes automatic fallback to OpenAI models if Gemini processing fails, ensuring robust operation.

## Configuration

The Gemini integration is configured in the following files:

1. **utils/geminiClient.ts**: Contains the client implementation for interacting with Google's Generative AI API.

2. **utils/metadataExtractor.ts**: Implements the metadata extraction logic with Gemini as the primary model.

3. **.env**: Contains the API key configuration:
   ```
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

The metadata extraction system automatically uses Gemini by default. No additional configuration is required.

```typescript
// Example usage in code
import { extractMetadata } from '../utils/metadataExtractor';

// Will use Gemini by default
const metadata = await extractMetadata(documentText, documentSource);

// Explicitly specify model if needed
const metadata = await extractMetadata(documentText, documentSource, { model: 'gemini' });

// Force OpenAI usage if needed
const metadata = await extractMetadata(documentText, documentSource, { model: 'gpt-4' });
```

## Performance Metrics

Based on testing with sample documents:

| Model | Avg. Extraction Time | Extraction Quality | Relative Cost |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Gemini 2.0 Flash | 2-3 seconds | High | 1x |
| GPT-3.5 Turbo | 1-2 seconds | Medium-High | ~3x |
| GPT-4 | 3-5 seconds | Very High | ~10x |

## Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling:

1. If Gemini processing fails, the system automatically falls back to the configured OpenAI model.
2. All errors are logged with detailed context for debugging.
3. Retry mechanisms ensure maximum reliability even with temporary API issues.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Monitor the performance and cost of the Gemini integration through:

- Processing logs that show extraction times and model usage
- Error logs for any failed extraction attempts
- Cost tracking through Google Cloud console

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. Implementing model-specific prompting to better leverage each model's strengths
2. Adding more specialized metadata extraction for different document types
3. Creating a dynamic model selection system based on document complexity
