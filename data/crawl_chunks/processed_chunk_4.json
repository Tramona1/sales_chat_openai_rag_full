This article was originally published on Silicon Valley Business Journal , and is adapted from an interview by Lynn Peithman Stock, Deputy Managing Editor of Silicon Valley Business Journal. Desmond Lim CEO and co-Founder, Workstream, Palo Alto Age 34 Education Master's, public policy and business, Harvard University MIT, Media Lab Accomplishments Starting up my first business while in college - a restaurant, to pay for my tuition fees. Being the first in my family to go to college and attending MIT and Harvard. Starting up Workstream with my co-founders and teammates to help local businesses. How do you deal with stress? I started going for short walks throughout the day. I take an average of four to five short walks (5 to 10 minutes) throughout the day either while on calls or just taking short break. It also helps me to get time away from the computer screen so I can come back refreshed. Home office I have a simple set up with an adjustable standing desk, laptop, Airpods and two large water bottles. Best part of your job To empower local businesses to hire better and help hourly workers. Both my parents are hourly workers and I used to run my own restaurant. I am glad to be able to give back and create impact, especially in current times when they need our help the most. Most challenging obstacle While serving as an Infantry officer in the Singapore Army, I went for 10 days without food while having to navigate out from the jungles of Brunei as part of a simulation of a plane crash. I lost 15 pounds after the ordeal, but learned so much about the human spirit, persistence and hard work. Favorite exercise Running and stretching, lots of it. Read more on Workstream in the News !

That's why we've created this comprehensive guide specifically tailored for hourly workers. By equipping your team with the understanding of what Form W-4 is and how to fill it out correctly, you can improve retention, boost morale, and enhance overall job satisfaction. Share this post with your team, or download the PDF above to share. Employee introduction Disclaimer: These materials are intended to provide you with general information, including guidance on completing Form W-4, and are not intended as tax or legal advice. Accordingly, as each individual’s employment and tax circumstances may vary, these materials may not address your unique situation. We encourage you to consult with your tax professional or attorney or seek guidance from your relevant taxing authority to ensure your compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  As tax laws vary by jurisdiction and change over time, please consult with your professional advisor or appropriate governmental agency before making any filings or financial planning decisions. So, you just started your first job, or you recently changed jobs. Congratulations! Before you begin working for your new employer, you’ll be asked to complete Form W-4. How you fill out your W-4 determines how much of your money is withheld for taxes on every paycheck. You may also need to update Form W-4 when a significant change happens in your life—like the birth (or adoption) of a child, getting married or divorced, starting a business, or getting a second job. In fact, any time your personal or financial situation changes, consider completing a new W-4. It helps to make sure that your employer withholds the correct federal income tax from your pay. If too much is withheld, you’ll likely be owed a refund. However, when too little is withheld, you’ll likely owe money when you file your tax return—along with a penalty if you can’t pay on time. This is why it’s important to understand the W-4 so you can fill it out as accurately as possible. A quick overview For many of us, filling out Form W-4 is usually a simple, straightforward process. For example, if you're single (or married to a partner who doesn't work), only have one job, and aren't planning on claiming tax credits beyond the standard deduction, completing the W-4 is as easy as filling in your name, address, social security number, and filing status—all before you sign and date it. However, if you have a spouse who also works, plan to claim any dependents (such as your children), or have income (not from jobs) like stock dividends, it gets more complicated. Whatever your situation, everyone can benefit from a breakdown (or refresher) of the Form W-4. Let's go over it step by step. Starting with... Step 1: Enter personal information This is the section where you provide much of the same information you did back when you first applied for your job—starting with first name, middle initial, and last name. Your employer needs a social security number so the money they withhold from your pay throughout the year can be sent directly to the IRS and applied to your annual income tax bill. The next part is filing status. If you’re single (or married filing separately), all that’s left for you to do is skip ahead to Step 5 to sign and date your W-4. Then you’re done! Everyone else needs to complete Steps 2 through 4. Step 2: Multiple jobs or spouse works If you’ve proceeded to this step, it means you hold more than one job at a time or you’re married and filing jointly with a spouse who also works. This leaves you with one choice of three options: Option (a) : If you or your spouse have self-employment income, use the Tax Withholding Estimator Tool* to calculate how much federal income tax you want your employer to withhold from your check. This estimate is only as accurate as the information provided, so be sure you have your other income info handy (including your spouse’s) as needed. Option (b): If you and your spouse have three or more jobs combined, the Multiple Jobs Worksheet on page 3 of the W-4 will need to be used. For accurate withholding, only complete this worksheet if you're the spouse in your couple with the higher-paying job. Option (c) : If there are only two jobs total between you and your spouse, use this option. You’ll want to do the same on the W-4 for the other job. Option C is more accurate than Option B if the pay at the lower-paying job is more than half that of the higher-paying job. * www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator Remember, when you move forward to Steps 3-4(b) on your Form W-4, only fill out those steps for ONE of your jobs (the higher-paying one). Leave those steps blank for all of the other jobs. Step 3: Claim dependents and other credits If you have dependents and your total income is $200,000 or less ($400,000 or less if married and filing jointly), you may qualify to claim dependents and lower your tax liability. This usually takes the form of the Child Tax Credit for each qualifying dependent child under the age of 17. Qualifying dependents can also be any direct relative, in-law, or foster child whose gross income is less than $5,500 and who you provide at least half their financial support throughout the year. On this step of the W-4, you’re instructed how to calculate your tax credits—totaling from $2,000 for each qualifying child under age 17 and $500 for each of your other qualifying dependents. Step 4: Other adjustments This is the section of the W-4 where you can opt to have your employer withhold additional pay from your paycheck. If you have extra sources of income, this is where you make sure enough pay is being withheld so you can avoid underpayment penalties or a surprise tax bill next April. Line 4 (a) is for people who earn \"non-job\" income that isn't subjected to withholding throughout the year—such as retirement income or dividends from investments. Line 4 (b) is for deductions itemized using the Deductions Worksheet on page 3—like mortgage interest, charitable deductions, or medical costs over 7.5% of your income. Line 4 (c) is for any additional tax you want withheld from your pay throughout the year. Step 5: Sign here This step is self-explanatory. Make the form valid with your signature and the date you signed it. In summary All employees are required to fill out a W-4 with their employer so they can withhold money from your paycheck for federal taxes with the IRS. The form only needs to be filled out when you start a new job or have a big life change like getting married, having a child, or landing a second job. Fill out the form as accurately as possible—paying attention to any deductions or tax credits you may qualify for or taking note if you need extra money withheld to avoid a tax bill next April. Keep this guide as a resource for the next time you need to fill out or update your W-4.

Financial literacy—the ability and knowledge to make informed financial decisions—is important for employees to feel empowered with their finances. For quick-service restaurant (QSR) employees, it’s arguably even more important. A study by the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center shows financial literacy is particularly low among Gen Z individuals, who also make up most of the QSR workforce. As a QSR leader, your team’s financial literacy matters. Not only will it help make your HR and payroll processes more efficient, but it will also help create a positive work environment and improve retention. In this article, we’ll dig deeper into the positive impact that financial literacy can have on hourly workers and on your business and explain what you can do to improve it. Financial literacy for employees: decoding pay stubs The first step for hourly workers to better manage their money is to learn how to read pay stubs. Even for employees who work Monday through Friday from 9 to 5, that first pay stub can be a doozy . For hourly workers, however, it tends to be more complicated, as they have to navigate through varied pay structures (hourly wages, overtime rates, and shift differentials), schedules that change from week to week, resulting in fluctuating paychecks, and compliance with specific labor laws and regulations governing minimum wage, overtime pay, and break periods. Teaching hourly workers how to crack the code of pay stubs will help their financial literacy in three ways: It makes money become real. If all employees know is that they worked X amount of hours and earned Y amount of money without having any clue of what happened between those two points, then money becomes an abstract thing, a little more than a number on a piece of paper. When they learn what goes on behind the scenes of a pay stub—labor laws, taxes, calculations, and so on—money becomes much more real. This change in perspective helps when it’s time to actually manage their money. It helps them plan ahead. Once hourly workers understand how wages are calculated, they will be able to know how much they’ll earn based on their worked hours. That, in turn, will help them plan their budgeting and spending. It prevents underpayments. Payroll software has been around for decades. Yet, errors, such as misclassifying employees or incorrectly withholding employee taxes, happen all the time . As a result of those errors, employees may get paid less than they should be, which will obviously hurt their finances. Knowing how to read a pay stub will help them prevent that. How financially savvy employees help payroll processing Teaching employees how their wages are calculated will benefit your HR team, too: It ensures accuracy. When payroll errors go undetected, your best allies are employees who can identify discrepancies, increasing your accuracy in payroll processing. It improves compliance . Errors in paychecks have consequences. They may put you in breach of labor and wage laws and even lead to fines and costly legal disputes. With knowledgeable employees who know how to take care of their money, you have more chances of fixing those errors sooner rather than later. It saves HR time . Educated employees require less assistance and clarifications from HR or payroll administrators, freeing up valuable time and resources and reducing the likelihood of payroll-related inquiries and disputes. What you can do as an employer to improve financial literacy Actively train and provide resources Offer comprehensive training sessions or workshops that cover various aspects of financial literacy. Reading pay stubs is an important part, but you can also train them on: Payroll processes: how payroll works, how to identify common payroll errors and discrepancies, such as missing hours, incorrect wage rates, or unauthorized deductions. Tax and labor laws: what standard deductions are and how they vary from person to person, tax withholding, minimum wage, etc. Need help? Our employee W-4 guide is a great resource to hand out. Personal budgeting: budgeting, saving, debt management, and retirement planning. Consider partnering with tools like YNAB , a popular budgeting application that offers Financial Wellness packages for employers. To accommodate different learning styles, make sure the training is easily accessible and available in multiple formats—workshops, seminars, written materials, online resources, or video tutorials that employees can reference at any time. Encourage workers to review pay stubs and ask questions Create an open and supportive environment where employees feel comfortable asking questions about their pay. Encourage managers and payroll staff to address inquiries promptly and thoroughly, ensuring that employees receive accurate information and clarification when needed. Use technology Leverage payroll software and digital tools to streamline payroll processes and provide employees with easy access to their pay information. Consider implementing self-service portals where employees can view their pay stubs, track hours worked, and update personal information. Seek feedback and adapt Regularly solicit feedback from employees about their payroll experiences and areas where they may need additional support or clarification. Use this feedback to identify opportunities for improvement and tailor educational efforts to address specific needs or concerns. The link between financial literacy and the bottom line Investing time and resources to improve the financial literacy of your employees has a direct correlation with your bottom line in two ways: Improved retention. Transparent communication about payroll builds trust between employers and employees. When workers feel confident they are being paid accurately and fairly, morale and job satisfaction increase, fostering a positive work environment and improving retention. Better productivity. Financial literacy leads to improved financial stability and reduced stress about money. And a less stressed and preoccupied workforce is a more productive and focused one. Conclusion Although you can’t be responsible for how your employees manage their money, there are things you can do to help them do it better. By investing in their financial literacy, you’re showing you want them to succeed not only at work but also in their financial life. That will have a positive impact on them as individuals but also on your business in terms of better payroll accuracy, a positive work environment, improved retention, and higher productivity.

This can encompass everything from payroll information, performance data, and health records. This data is becoming more and more complicated, and the scrutiny of how this data is stored is only going to become more stringent. That’s why so many HR departments now utilize some form of h uman resource information system (HRIS). So, what is HRIS, and how does it work? What is HRIS? HRIS stands for h uman resource information system . Simply put, a h uman resource information system is a software application that is used to store, track, and manage employee data , enhancing the overall employee experience . An HRIS is often used by HR departments to streamline many of the tasks that they would otherwise have to do manually. This can free up time for HR professionals so they can focus on more strategic tasks like recruiting and training employees. HRIS vs HRMS vs HCM : Understanding the difference It can be easy to mix up the terms HRIS, HRMS (h uman resource management system ), and HCM (h uman capital management ). Here’s a quick breakdown of each term so you can better understand the difference: HRIS stands for human resource information system. An HRIS is a software application that includes time tracking , data security , user-friendly apps , overall HR systems management, and more. It stores and tracks employee data efficiently, ensuring a seamless experience for HR professionals . HRMS stands for human resource management system. An HRMS is a more comprehensive system that not only tracks employee data but also incorporates features for payroll, time and attendance tracking, and performance management . HCM stands for human capital management. HCM is a holistic approach to managing all aspects of an employee’s lifecycle, from recruitment to retirement. HCM systems often include features for payroll, benefits administration , talent management , and more. Functions of an HRIS HRIS software can vary in terms of the features and functionality it offers. However, some core functions are typically included: Time and attendance management For many organizations, tracking employee time and attendance is no longer a manual, physical process. Most HRIS include a digital way to track employee time (working time), leveraging advanced HR technology , and automating workforce management . Payroll and compensation management Some HRIS offers payroll management features, which can be used to process employee paychecks and generate reports on payroll costs. Payroll can be complicated when you begin to account for different taxes , vacation time, sick pay, and more. With the integration of effective software solutions , payroll management becomes streamlined, enhancing benefits management and ensuring accurate employee records . Benefits administration Benefits work differently than payroll, so your HRIS must allow you to deal with them separately.  You’ll need to worry about bonuses and retirement without allowing them to get in each other’s way. This streamlines record-keeping and supports HR strategy and workforce planning . Performance management Your h uman resource information system should be able to give you a bird’s eye view of how your staff is performing, including performance reviews and employee benefits . This level of insight enables you to make strategic decisions and work with your employees to improve their performance, thereby enhancing retention . Organizational management Organizing the various aspects of your workforce can be tough. A good human resources information system can bring order to the chaos, whether it’s managing meetings, paperwork, or even logistics between different locations. To effectively handle new hires , resumes , and user experience , HR teams can rely on a software solution . Additionally, effective HR teams use advanced applicant tracking systems to streamline talent acquisition processes, ensuring seamless integration with the HRIS. Employee self-service Many HRIS offer an employee self-service portal that allows employees to view and update their employee information . This includes contact information, emergency contacts, and other core HR information . Reporting and analytics HRIS can generate various reports, such as employee turnover rates and the average time it takes to fill a position. Having an HRIS analyst is beneficial because these reports can be used to make data-driven decisions about HR policies, HRIS solutions , different data management metrics , and potentially even inform future strategy decisions for management. Workflows and approvals HRIS can be used to create and manage workflows , such as the approval process for vacation requests. Without a clear workflow in place, it’s very easy for one person to become a bottleneck, which may cause you to run into employee morale and compliance issues. Types of HRIS The best HRIS comes down to what your business needs. While most HRIS do have some core functions in common, there’s a lot of variation in the types of HRIS systems on the market. Here are some of the most common types of HRIS : Operational HRIS Operational HRIS is designed to streamline the day-to-day tasks of HR professionals . These systems typically include features for time and attendance tracking, benefits administration , and employee self-service . Strategic HRIS A strategic human resources information system is designed to help HR professionals align their activities with the overall strategy of the organization. These systems typically include features for performance management , talent management , and succession planning. Tactical HRIS Tactical HRIS is designed to help HR professionals make data-driven decisions about HR policies and procedures. These systems typically include reporting and analytics features, as well as a knowledge base of HR best practices. Comprehensive HRIS Comprehensive HRIS is designed to provide a complete solution for HR management . These systems typically include all of the features of an operational, strategic, and tactical HRIS. It also includes additional features for payroll processing , time and attendance tracking, and benefits administration . These are typically the top-class HRIS and are generally the most expensive, too. Limited function HRIS Limited function HRIS is designed for businesses that don’t require a full-featured HRIS. These systems typically include only the most essential HR functions , such as employee self-service and benefits administration . For some HR departments , most HRIS functions have either been built in or outsourced. In this situation, you may only need a singular function. Choosing the right HRIS for your business One challenge businesses may find when they wish to implement a new HRIS is how to choose the right one. Consider these guidelines. The size of your organization If you have a large organization with hundreds or even thousands of employees, you will need an HRIS that is scalable and can handle all of your employee data . On the other hand, if you have a small organization with only a few dozen employees, you may not need a fully-featured HRIS and can get by with a simpler HRIS system . The needs of your HR department You should choose an HRIS that includes the features and functionality your HR department needs to carry out its tasks effectively. For example, if your HR department is responsible for managing payroll, you will need an HRIS with payroll processing capabilities. If they need assistance with the onboarding process, an HRIS will be very helpful as well. It’s important not to get caught up in the bells and whistles of an exciting new tool. Only incorporate what’s needed or what will support your business. Your budget HRIS can vary widely in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars per year. You should choose an HRIS that fits within your budget and offers the features and functionality you need. Remember, the broader the scope of your HRIS, the more expensive it’s likely to be. Benefits of an HRIS Human resource information systems can transform your HR department overnight and lead to huge growth and savings for your business. Here are some of the potential benefits you can expect from HRIS software : Improved efficiency HRIS can automate many of the tasks that HR professionals have to do manually, such as tracking employee data , processing payroll, and managing benefits. This can lead to increased efficiency and productivity within the HR department . Better d ecision making HRIS can provide managers with access to real-time data on employee performance , time and attendance, and other factors. This data can be used to make informed decisions about things like staffing levels, training needs, and employee development. Reduced costs HRIS can help businesses save money by automating tasks that would otherwise have to be done manually. For example, an HRIS can be used to process payroll electronically, which can save the business money on paper and postage costs. It can even help bring outsourced functions back in-house without adding to your current staff’s workload. Improved compliance HRIS can help businesses stay compliant with laws and regulations related to HR, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Data breaches are a common issue with manual systems, as dealing with large swathes of data by hand is a near-impossible task. An HRIS can provide a secure HR system by knowing that data is being handled securely and compliantly. Increased employee satisfaction By providing employees with self-service capabilities and easy access to their HR data , HRIS can improve employee satisfaction and engagement. Challenges of an HRIS While HRIS can offer several benefits for businesses, there are some challenges you should be aware of. These challenges include: Implementation and integration Implementing an HRIS can be a complex and time-consuming process. The system must be properly configured and integrated with other business systems, such as payroll and accounting. Training will also be needed to ensure all relevant stakeholders are comfortable with the system and can use it without causing compliance breaches. Cost HRIS can be expensive, both to purchase and to maintain. If not managed properly, the costs associated with an HRIS can outweigh the benefits. It’s important to consider just how broad of a h uman resource information system you need. Are you hoping to replace the majority of your HR functions or just replace something narrow like payroll? A more focused product may be a lot more cost-effective. Employee privacy Some employees may be concerned about the amount of personal information stored in an HRIS. Businesses must take steps to ensure employee data is used appropriately and only accessed by authorized personnel and that it’s safe and secure from breaches. System downtime If an HRIS goes down, it can have a significant impact on the business. Businesses must have contingency plans in place to deal with system outages. Compliance Businesses must ensure that their HRIS is compliant with all relevant laws and regulations. Storage of personal data with data security is often core to these systems, so compliance is of the utmost importance. Getting an HRIS certification will help surmount the challenges you might face and it will give you the expertise needed to handle an HRIS. HRIS and the cloud Cloud technology has transformed the way most businesses store and manage data. Cloud-based HRIS offers several advantages over traditional on-premise HRIS. These advantages include lower costs, increased flexibility, and better scalability. However, there are also some challenges that businesses need to be aware of when considering a cloud-based HRIS. These challenges include: Security One of the main concerns with cloud-based HRIS is security. HR data deals explicitly with people and will include things like social security numbers, addresses, and even possible health-related data. Not only is it extremely important to keep this data safe to protect the individuals, but it’s also a serious compliance issue that could potentially cost your company a lot of money. Implementation Another challenge with cloud-based HRIS is implementation. Because these systems are usually hosted by a third-party provider , businesses need to make sure they have the resources and expertise in place to properly implement and use the system. Vendor lock-in Another potential challenge with cloud-based HRIS is vendor lock-in. When businesses choose a cloud-based HRIS, they’re usually relying on a single vendor for their HR software needs. This can make it difficult to switch to a different vendor if the business isn’t happy with the service or the costs. The future of HRIS Some of the trends that are likely to shape the future of HRIS include: The rise of artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used to automate tasks. This trend is likely to continue as AI technology becomes more sophisticated. HRIS will likely look to implement this technology to allow for even more automation . The increasing importance of data As HRIS become more sophisticated, they will be able to generate increasingly large amounts of data. This data will be used to inform decisions about things like staffing levels, training needs, and employee development. It will also be important to have a highly developed HR staff that can understand the data and make decisions with it, too. Compliance With the ever-changing landscape of HR regulations, compliance is becoming an increasingly important concern for businesses. This heightened scrutiny from regulators underscores the necessity for HR teams to invest in advanced software solutions for efficient record-keeping and compliance management. Employee engagement As the war for talent intensifies, businesses are increasingly looking for ways to improve employee engagement . HRIS will need to be able to help businesses identify and address issues that impact employee engagement . FAQ What is HRIS in simple terms? HRIS stands for h uman resource information system .

Share this article As business owners, navigating taxes is incredibly confusing. It is the employer's duty to deposit, report and pay the employment taxes by the respective due dates . If you find yourself struggling, you aren't alone. Workstream is here to help! All employers should be aware that there are different types of federal-level taxes: Federal income tax Social security and Medicare taxes Additional Medicare tax Federal Unemployment tax (FUTA) Before delving into what each tax mean for your business, remember to submit the following 2 forms before the end of January every year to the Social Security Administration (SSA) in order to report the salary, wages, tips or any other forms of compensation paid to an employee. W-3 Form, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements W-2 Form, Wage and Tax Statement 1. Federal Income Tax The federal taxes for workers fall under the IRS's oversight. All the employers are responsible for withholding taxes from their employees' pay checks. According to the IRS, in order to know how much tax to retain, employers should check the W-4 Form along with the withholding tables in Publication 15, Employer's Tax Guide . 2. Social Security and Medicare Taxes The Social Security Tax applies to both employers and employees. It is used to fund the Social Security and Medicare programs and are collected as a form of payroll form tax as mandated by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) .

The Medicare program has no wage limit and the tax rate is 1.45% for both employees and employers. Check the employee’s W-4 Form to determine the correct amount you need to withhold. 3.

It can feel like cash is just being squandered when labor expenses are getting away from you. You work hard to increase profits, but then they just drain away again because the cost of labor is so high. Lowering labor costs , now that's an art and science all its own - kind of like finding that pesky hole in the bucket and patching it up good as new. And guess what? It doesn't mean cutting corners or compromising on quality either. This journey we're about to embark upon will shine a light on how absenteeism affects those ever-rising costs, how overtime hours could be chipping away at your profit margins, and why boosting employee morale isn’t just nice-to-have—it’s essential for cost savings . Understanding Labor Costs in the Restaurant Industry For any restaurant, labor costs are a significant piece of the pie. But what if you could slice that pie thinner? Let's chew on some ways to reduce labor costs without sacrificing quality or service. Buddy punching, when an employee clocks in for another who isn't present, can inflate your payroll by an average of 2.2 percent according to HuffPost . It’s like paying extra for pepperoni you didn’t get. The Role of Absenteeism in Labor Costs Absenteeism can be a huge drain on resources - it's as though someone left the fridge door open. By merging vacation and sick leave into one paid-time-off bucket, we make sure employees get their well-deserved rest time while keeping things efficient. This strategy not only helps manage absenteeism but also contributes significantly towards reducing associated direct costs. After all, even small cost reductions ripple outwards just like tossing a pebble into still water: they increase profit margins and provide room for growth. In our quest to save money and serve top-notch meals with happy customers returning daily, strategies such as these are vital tools in our apron pockets. Reducing labor costs is no easy task; it requires continuous effort from business owners and managers alike. But remember - every little bit counts. Leveraging Technology Can Help Too Speaking of tools – technology is one super-sharp knife we shouldn’t ignore. From scheduling software that eliminates buddy punching practices to automated HR systems which reduce administrative work, technology can be a powerful ally in controlling labor costs. Like an expert chef fine-tuning their recipes, savvy restaurant owners know the importance of continuously seeking out ways to optimize operations and reduce costs without compromising on quality. Key Takeaway: Reducing labor costs in the restaurant industry doesn't mean sacrificing quality or service. By tackling buddy punching, managing absenteeism with efficient leave strategies, and leveraging technology for administrative tasks, you can trim expenses significantly. It's a continuous effort that needs constant fine-tuning but remember - every little bit counts. The Influence of Employee Schedules on Labor Costs Work schedules and hours worked can significantly affect labor costs, especially in the restaurant industry. Not only the number of hours worked, but also when they work can have a major impact on labor costs. The Impact of Overtime Hours on Labor Costs Overtime hours are a common aspect of the restaurant business. They're necessary during peak customer traffic times or when there's an unexpected rush. But these additional hours come at a price: time-and-a-half pay rate for every hour beyond 40 in a week. Business owners might think overtime is simply unavoidable, but strategic use of employee schedules can optimize productivity while controlling extra costs. From my own experience managing eateries, I can illustrate how to make the most of employee schedules and lessen extra costs. Instead of asking one employee to clock high overtime, I'd often distribute those extra hours among part-time shift workers who were hungry for more time. This tactic did two things – It helped us decrease stress levels by reducing staff burnout (a known morale killer) and lowered our regular pay expenses because we avoided costly overtime rates. An added benefit was that spreading out shifts improved our overall customer experience since fresh minds provided top-notch service. We saw reduced turnover as employees felt less overworked and appreciated their fair workweek laws-abiding schedule. Research has shown that Fair Workweek laws requiring advance notice for work schedules can result in significant labor cost savings . In conclusion? There isn't one magic bullet to reduce labor costs — but rethinking your scheduling approach could be a surprisingly effective tool you've overlooked till now. Now go forth and make some smart schedule swaps. Strategies to Optimize Employee Morale and Productivity One way businesses can reduce labor costs is by increasing employee morale . Workers who are content and satisfied in their roles will generate better outcomes, provide excellent customer service, and help keep customers coming back. Plus, retaining a star performer is far cheaper than hiring new talent. Employees who feel valued and content in their roles are driven to exert greater effort, thus yielding improved customer satisfaction and increased sales. This leads to better customer experiences and increased sales—win-win for everyone. The Power of Performance Bonuses Incentives play an important role in boosting productivity levels among employees. Consider performance bonuses: this reward system doesn't just increase output—it also encourages teamwork since success often depends on collective effort. Bonuses create a sense of excitement around reaching targets and achieving goals together as a team which improves camaraderie at the workplace. Maintain High Spirits Through Engagement To maintain high spirits among your workforce consistently, ensure regular engagement activities are part of your company culture. Not only do these foster unity within teams but they make work fun - something we all need on those tough days. This strategy does double duty – helping you attract quality talent while keeping current stars shining brightly. A Streamlined Approach with Time Tracking Tech Moreover, digital tools have evolved beyond mere punch clocks; they now offer detailed insights into how much time employees spend on different tasks during their shifts. This granular view can help restaurant owners understand where most effort (and thus cost) goes into providing top-notch service - making adjustments wherever necessary will directly impact both customer satisfaction rates and profit margins positively. By leveraging technology, we can not only track time more efficiently but also use it to our advantage - a true win-win situation. Key Takeaway: Embrace tech to help manage your team's time better. Not only does it put an end to practices like buddy punching, but smart software can analyze work patterns for efficiency boosts. Plus, advanced scheduling features ensure balanced task distribution and less burnout among staff. These digital tools offer a clear picture of how employees use their work hours . This helps pinpoint areas that might need improvement, leading to increased productivity and efficiency. The Role of Continuous Improvement Programs in Reducing Waste Continuous improvement programs like Six Sigma have been game-changers for businesses across the globe. By focusing on reducing waste and optimizing production processes, they can lead to significant cost savings . In a restaurant setting, this could mean refining how food is prepared or served to reduce labor costs . Or perhaps it's streamlining administrative tasks so staff members can focus more on delivering top-notch service and less on paperwork. Six Sigma techniques are designed specifically to reduce variation and eliminate defects . In layman's terms? It’s about making sure your restaurant runs as smoothly as possible – every single day. The Impact of Online Self-Service on Administrative Efficiency One key way that continuous improvement programs help save time (and therefore money) is by enabling self-service options for employees. When answers to common questions are made readily available online, HR professionals spend less time responding to inquiries - allowing them more opportunity for strategic work that benefits the entire business. Consider implementing an online portal where shift workers can easily access information regarding their schedules or pay rate . This not only reduces admin effort but also boosts employee morale by giving them greater control over their work lives - a win-win situation. To reap these benefits though, it’s crucial you're able use data effectively – which again calls upon principles from Six Sigma training. From analyzing customer traffic patterns at different times of day to managing inventory levels based on seasonal trends; accurate data analysis helps restaurants operate efficiently while keeping customers happy with high-quality products and services. Incentivizing Performance for Increased Productivity To keep the labor force engaged and motivated, many savvy business owners are turning to performance incentives . Giving incentives related to performance can have a positive effect on morale and result in greater productivity, which is beneficial for the financial success of your business. Bonuses, commission payments, or other rewards tied directly to an employee's output can be incredibly effective at encouraging hard work and dedication. By offering these incentives , you're not only expressing gratitude for their contributions; you're investing in the future prosperity of your business by incentivizing outstanding performance from quality personnel. If used correctly, this method will help reduce turnover rates while simultaneously increasing profits through improved customer experience provided by happy employees committed to providing top-notch service. Mental Health & Wellness Programs: A Win-Win Solution A focus on mental health and wellness within the workplace has been shown time after time as a win-win solution both for employers looking for cost savings methods and staff hoping to maintain physical health. Promoting overall well-being helps decrease absenteeism (such as sick leave) while boosting morale among shift workers who might otherwise feel overlooked or underappreciated—this attention reduces direct costs associated with turnover due mainly because healthier people tend towards staying longer in their jobs. So remember folks. When strategizing ways to lower labor costs - don't overlook what's right under your nose. The key to cost savings could be as simple as keeping your staff happy and motivated. Key Takeaway: Keeping your team on board is cheaper than hiring newbies. So, boost productivity with performance incentives like bonuses or commissions - they'll work harder and stick around longer. And don't forget about mental health; a focus on wellness can cut down sick days and keep morale high. The secret to lowering labor costs ? A happy, motivated workforce. FAQs in Relation to Lower Labor Costs Why is it important to reduce labor costs ? Lowering labor costs boosts profits, allows you to offer competitive pricing, and provides more flexibility for employee benefits. What factors affect labor costs? Labor costs are influenced by wages, benefits, training expenses, and turnover rates. Work schedules and absenteeism also have an impact. Conclusion By now, you've gathered that labor costs are more than just dollars and cents. They're about employee morale , work schedules , absenteeism control - they're the heart of your business.

Share this article Whether you're an employer looking into offering benefits or a part-time employee looking for the best benefits program available to you, you may be wondering, “How many hours can a part-time employee work?” While it seems like a straightforward question, the answer is surprisingly complex. There's no precise definition of a part-time employee . The same employee working 35 hours may be full-time at one job and part-time at another. On the other hand, there are federal, state, and local regulations governing how many hours an employee can work without particular benefits. Temporary employees are largely exempt from any regulations on benefits, and there’s no real definition of temporary employee either. So, how many hours can a part-time employee work? Here's the surprisingly complicated answer to this standard question. What is a Part-Time Employee? A part-time employee is generally considered someone working 30 hours and below. But this distinction varies by employer. Exactly what is defined as part-time is specified by the contract between employer and employee. What benefits are part-time employees eligible for? Part-time employees may be entitled to the same benefits as employees with full-time status, but typically they are offered a reduced package compared to their full-time counterparts. Some benefits are required by federal or state law. Here are a few of the most common benefits offered to part-time employees: Unemployment Workers’ compensation Overtime pay Retirement savings plans Family leave Medical leave Health insurance Paid vacation Fringe benefits like education plans, flexible schedules, free meals, etc. How Many Hours can a Part-Time Employee Work Without Benefits? What is the 30-hour rule for ACA? Eligible employees need to work more than 30 hours per week or 130 hours per month qualify for enrollment in federally-mandated employee benefits . If hours fluctuate, you'll need to track them carefully. What is the 1,000 hour rule? Eligibility requirements like the 1,000 hour rule ensure workers are receiving the benefits they’re entitled to. According to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), employees who work a thousand hours or more in a year are entitled to the same kind of standard retirement plans offered to all of the employees at a given company. Your state may have additional regulations to these federal laws. The question of whether you'll be able to attract quality part-time employees without offering any benefits is another question entirely. For instance, at large employers like Starbucks, employees become benefits eligible once they receive 240 hours over three consecutive months. This benefits eligibility includes healthcare benefits such as medical, dental and vision, short long-term disability, life insurance, paid parental leave, and much more. Starbucks even offers a college achievement plan if you don't have a bachelor's degree. Not all businesses offer the kinds of part-time benefits that Starbucks does. However, businesses that want to be competitive and attract the best talent to part-time positions typically must offer a robust benefits package. Are part-time employees entitled to benefits? While part-time employees typically don't get as many benefits as full-time employees , there are laws governing how part-time employees are compensated and what they are entitled to. Laws regarding disability leave, sick leave , and health insurance can vary by state. The Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) requires all employers nationwide with more than 50 full-time or full-time equivalent employees to offer health insurance if employees work at least 30 hours a week or 130 hours per month. Businesses are required to offer part-time employees a standard retirement plan to all employees if they've worked at least 1,000 hours over the course of a year, according to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ). Executive order 13706 extends particular benefits to contractors with the federal government regarding paid sick leave . What kinds of careers typically employ part-time employees ? We usually think about part-time employees as being in jobs in the restaurant industry, childcare, particularly in-home child care, and support jobs like cleaning and gardening. However, more and more jobs are becoming part-time as the workforce and careers change. Contract work is becoming increasingly common. More and more businesses are striving to keep employees part-time so as to increase the flexibility of their talent pool and avoid paying benefits. In today's workforce, anyone, from client services, to nursing staff, to professional white-collar work, might be part-time. How many hours can a part-time employee work without benefits if they have a temporary position? Temporary workers typically aren’t eligible for benefits provided to full or part-time employees , even if they work 30 or 40 hours a week. Temporary work is something of a loophole in benefits regulations since the period of time in which an employee can remain “temporary” isn’t standard. This is true even of businesses that provide good benefits to part-time and full-time employees , like Starbucks. Federal regulations on how businesses must provide benefits, such as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) don't apply to temporary workers. Many state benefits packages , such as Florida laws regarding health insurance , exempt temporary employees. The temporary classification can pose a problem for workers who may be stuck in limbo, ineligible for health benefits they would otherwise be entitled to. Temporary workers supplied and paid by a staffing agency may be categorized as temporary regardless of how long they work for a particular company. For businesses with high turnover and low-skill work, having temporary employees, whether provided by an agency or employed directly by the company, can be a tool to reduce the health benefits that need to be paid. While OSHA protects temporary workers from workplace safety violations in the same way as permanent workers, temporary workers aren’t entitled to the same benefits as full or part-time workers . How many hours can a part-time employee work? It depends. The number of hours a part-time employee can work without being entitled to a benefit plan including things like health insurance and retirement depends on the number of hours worked, the type of contract between employer and employee, local, state and federal regulations, whether the job is government or civilian, and whether the work is temporary. If you're not sure what kind of benefits your business needs to offer, take these variables into consideration as you begin your research.

    "text": "This Hardee's franchisee reduced their time to hire by 78% Hardee's franchisee Restaurant Management Corporation struggled with interview scheduling. After implementing Workstream, they significantly reduced their time-to-hire and streamlined communication with applicants, ensuring a steady flow of applications and a fully staffed workforce. “It’s all about ease of communication. Workstream aligns with our ‘employee first’ mentality. Our team members are the face of Hardee’s, and it lets us show them how valuable they are to us.” Troy Willard Training and Ops Services, Restaurant Management Corporation The problem Manual hiring processes keep restaurants short-staffed About CKE Restaurant Holdings Restaurant Management Corp is a 14-location Hardee’s franchisee based out of Shippensburg, PA. Hardee's and Carl's Jr. are owned and operated by CKE Restaurant Holdings, Inc. CKE, which stands for Carl Karcher Enterprises, was founded by Carl Karcher in 1941 when he opened his first hot dog stand in Los Angeles, California. Over the years, the company expanded and evolved, ultimately becoming known for its iconic burger brands. Locations: 3,800+ Industry: Restaurants Employees: ~25,000 Like many other fast food restaurant general managers, Shay Silver was constantly faced with the challenge of keeping her Carlisle, PA Hardee’s location fully staffed. She wasted too much time sifting through unqualified applications, leaving her store hurting for quality new hires. Even using a common online marketplace for hourly job seekers didn’t seem to ever close the gap between the flow of incoming applications and their staffing needs. When her hiring team did find applicants worth pursuing, they were often frustrated by the time-consuming back-and-forth of setting up interviews. Because much of the restaurant’s hiring process was still manual in nature, it meant job seekers often waited days to be contacted. By the time interviews were scheduled, it was too late for some applicants; they had moved on to another opportunity. The solution Streamlining HR processes accelerates hiring In his Training and Ops Services role for Restaurant Management Corp., Troy Willard oversees new procedures and product integrations for 14 Hardee’s locations with over 300 employees. Seeing how his franchises lacked text-to-apply options, applicant QR codes, or recruitment signage, he realized they needed a new HR platform—which is when Troy found Workstream. Automated self-scheduling From the onset, Troy and his staff loved how applicants could set up their own interviews based on the availability of Hardee’s hiring managers at each location. Team communications Given how often people are on their phones, the texting capabilities of Workstream also proved immediately helpful in regard to all back-and-forth communication with prospective employees—simplifying the hiring process. Onboarding Before Worksteam, general managers like Shay were spending a minimum of 10+ hours a week on recruiting and onboarding alone. Now, those tasks take two to three hours a week at most. A lot of this improved efficiency resulted from their ability to save and access all their employment forms and documents in one place. Manager mobile app Time is of the essence for managers, who get an hour or two at most in the back office to complete operational tasks. Since Workstream’s functionality is accessible on mobile , Shay is now able to complete much of her office tasks during her commute. The status of completed or upcoming interviews can be viewed at the click of a button—rather than pulling things up on the computer. 78% faster hiring Built for the hourly workforce Staffing up is no longer stressful Workstream has transformed how Troy helps recruit, hire, onboard, and retain hourly workers. “I see our competitors hosting hiring events, but since partnering with Workstream, we haven’t had to do that. We have a constant flow of applications. Without it, we’d definitely be at a huge loss” Troy also likes the visibility and reporting that Workstream provides. “I’m a big fan of the weekly reports, the recaps of our applicant flow, as well as interviews and hires that I receive by email.” With the average time to fill an open position down from two weeks to three days, Shay’s issues with keeping her Carlisle, PA Hardee’s fully staffed and running smoothly are a thing of the past.

With Workstream, they were able to automate tedious hiring tasks and free up time to personalize the applicant experience and make staffing a breeze. \"If we had known it was going to be as easy and user-friendly and really help drive the applicant flow in our restaurants, we would’ve started with all our restaurants from the beginning.” Aaron Piper Director of Operations, OM Group The problem Slow hiring processes forced applicants to look elsewhere About OM Group OM Group owns and operates several franchise brands including Dunkin’, Baskin Robins, Qdoba, Smoothie King, and Jimmy John's. Dunkin' locations: ~48 Industry: Restaurants Like many quick-service restaurant operators in 2023, OM Group was struggling with an ongoing labor shortage and high turnover rates. Trying to solve its recruiting and retention problems felt overwhelming. In an industry where 38 days is the average time it takes to hire new employees, OM Group needed a more efficient and reliable method to recruit, interview, and hire hourly workers. Aaron Piper, Director of Operations for OM Group, had tried a few different platforms to source applicants, including sites offering free ads. But it required a lot of manual sifting through resumes, finding qualified applicants, and scheduling interviews—which often fell on one person, Amanda Ristic, Dunkin franchisee and Operating Partner with OM Group. The manual nature of this hiring process usually meant applicants were waiting too long for a response to their application and often moved on to other opportunities. the solution Smarter ways to attract and engage applicants When OM Group discovered Workstream, they were able to transform their hiring process. Amanda immediately was able to empower her managers to take an active role in hiring, freeing her up to support all OM Group's locations from the top down. From the start, several features proved helpful for getting applicants in the door faster. Sourcing tools Workstream makes it easy to post open positions all at the same time on multiple job boards . OM Group also loves the ability to create text-to-apply and QR-code posters. This mobile-friendly approach was ideal for capturing the attention of younger job seekers as they were visiting their local Dunkin’. Because these posters were so easy to create, Aaron’s team would test them to see what worked throughout the hiring process. Customizable hiring With Workstream, the job application itself became another thing for OM Group to test and optimize. Instead of a one-size-fits-all form, the amount (and type) of questions could easily be customized and switched out from a posting for a crew member to one for a district manager. Team Communication The ability to text applicants (rather than call them) resulted in faster responses and a better turnout from both younger millennial and Gen Z job seekers. Automated scheduling The tendency for people to ghost interviews also decreased once applicants could set up their own interview dates and times, based on the availability of the hiring manager, via text message. built for the hourly workforce A faster, more personal applicant experience Workstream has become an integral part of the recruitment, hiring, and onboarding process for OM Group. It’s helped them elevate the job seeker experience, from customizing what questions to ask to having an applicant’s favorite Dunkin’ drink ready at their interview. Andy enjoys seeing how active his restaurant and district managers are on the platform. If things are getting too busy or overwhelming at a franchise location, he knows he can always step in to help, keep things moving forward, and make sure staffing needs are met.

With over 100 locations globally, they needed a more efficient hiring solution. By implementing Workstream, MOOYAH achieved a 20% hiring rate, reduced applicant screening time, and streamlined their hiring process, allowing them to focus on proactive recruitment and fully staffed stores across America. “Workstream is very organized and really designed to fit your needs. All the information you need to know is right there, and there's very minimal work that I had to put in.” Training Specialist at MOOYAH Burgers Fries and Shakes The problem Manual processes and physical paperwork slows down hiring About MOOYAH MOOYAH, founded in 2007 in Texas, quickly gained fame for its customizable burgers and hand-cut fries. The brand's commitment to quality ingredients and a personalized dining experience led to nationwide expansion. MOOYAH's legacy is rooted in its innovative approach to the classic burger joint, fostering a loyal customer base. Locations: 100 Industry: Restaurant Employees: 2,000 While MOOYAH might be known for its innovative menu items, its hiring strategy was stuck in the past. Each step of their process was manual and tedious, including its reliance on physical paperwork for all documentation. Hiring managers were manually sifting through resumes, scheduling interviews, and even sending out and collecting onboarding documents. Instead of focusing on revenue-generating activities and taking their business to the next level, managers were bogged down in operational hiring tasks. Even worse, a slower higher process meant MOOYAH was losing potential employees to the competition. Due to their manual hiring processes, a lot of time and effort was spent on hiring efforts. Hiring managers had to oversee the scheduling of interviews, the actual interviews, and eventually onboarding. This deterred them from focusing on revenue-generating activities and taking their business to the next level. Furthermore, considering the sheer number of staff required for operations, there was a need to sieve through many candidates, which took up a greater amount of time. The solution Faster hiring means getting first dibs on talent MOOYAH knew it had to modernize its hiring processes to give hiring managers back their time and get applicants to their first day faster. The MOOYAH team turned to Workstream's HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform to help it digitize hiring and reach its goal of 100% fully staffed stores across the country. The features they rely on are: Job boards No more posting to each job board one by one. With Workstream, the MOOYAH hiring team can simultaneously post to popular job boards and review applications within the Workstream dashboard, saving them and keeping them organized. Smart screening MOOYAH hiring managers no longer have to manually sift through applications. Workstream's smart screening technology filters out unqualified applicants automatically so hiring managers only see candidates who are a good fit for their open positions. Automated self-scheduling Automated self-scheduling enables applicants to schedule their own interviews via text based on MOOYAH's hiring managers' availability, saving both parties time in tedious back and forth. Text-to-Apply Working in conjunction with automatic scheduling is the text-to-apply feature, which allows candidates to apply for a job by scanning a QR code. By making it convenient for candidates to apply, MOOYAH is able to secure a greater number of applicants. 3 days between job posting and interview date 10 days from set up to first hire BUILT FOR THE HOURLY WORKFORCE MOOYAH moves faster Since implementing Workstream, MOOYAH has accelerated its hiring process and saved hiring managers time.

    "text": "Smoothie King franchisee enhances efficiency and applicant experience with Workstream BCS Northern, a Smoothie King franchisee, was challenged with reaching and communicating with job applicants. Workstream's automated approach enabled them to keep applicants engaged throughout the hiring process and reduce time spent on hiring tasks by 80%. “The customer service is phenomenal! There’s not a question I haven’t had answered. We get our ads up, and we get people hired, and I think it’s just a great partnership.” Ann Miller HR Manager at BCS Northern The problem Communication breakdown alienates applicants About Smoothie King BCS Northern is a franchisee of 30 Smoothie King locations. Smoothie King offers a variety of smoothies designed for different health and fitness goals, such as weight loss, muscle building, and overall wellness. They use real fruit, natural sweeteners, and dietary supplements in their smoothies to provide customers with healthy and delicious options. Locations: ~1,200 Industry: Restaurants As HR Manager at BCS Northern, Ann Miller oversees a workforce that can average over 350 hourly employees for Smoothie King juice bars—one of the nation's leading smoothie brands. Ann is directly involved in every aspect of recruiting new workers. One of the biggest challenges maintaining good communication with applicants. Whenever a recruiter got too busy to reach out to an individual or when Ann was suddenly called into a meeting, interviews could get delayed. When the BCS Northern team tried to follow up, the applicants—likely feeling ignored or unappreciated—often ghosted interviews. Ann and her recruiting team at BCS Northern needed an HR technology solution that would prove more efficient than their old-school process of making phone calls, sending emails, and waiting for the other person to respond. They needed some way to get both parties involved in the process. the solution Attracting and engaging applicants in just a few clicks With Workstream’s automated and intuitive approach, it became easier to demonstrate just how interested, invested, and responsive the company was in its applicants. By better engaging candidates from application to interview to offer, Ann’s franchise stores stood out as places where people wanted to work. Team Communications Ann and her team leverage a mix of automated and personal messages to ensure applicants are getting communicated with at all the critical touch points. For applicants, this active two-way communication throughout the recruitment process gave them confidence that BCS Northern would provide a good employee experience as well. Job boards Workstream also expanded the company’s reach by letting it post to several job boards simultaneously —a process that once meant copying and pasting ads for open positions up to 15 times. With Workstream, there was no more guesswork about where to post open job positions or how to expand their search for the most qualified, motivated applicants. This greatly helps BCS Northern meet its need for new hourly workers—it averages 100 hires every month. 80% less time spent on hiring tasks built for the hourly workforce A happier workforce starts with smarter hiring Responsible for so many different franchise locations, Ann used to spend up to 15 hours a week tracking applications, contacting candidates, and scheduling interviews—all time that was spent before ever getting around to hiring anyone.

By implementing Workstream's automated hiring processes, Pieology tripled its applicant pool in just one week, hiring over 700 applicants. \"One of my managers told me the other day, 'With Workstream, my hiring organizes itself. It's a dream!' It was then I knew we had made the right choice in partnering with Workstream on this crucial part of our business.\" Tara Lindstrom VP of Marketing and Human Resources of Hundal Companies The problem Managers can't hire fast enough About Culver's Pieology, founded in 2011, revolutionized the pizza industry with its customizable, fast-casual model. The brand allows customers to craft their own pizzas, choosing from a variety of fresh ingredients. Pieology's commitment to innovation and quality has led to its widespread popularity, establishing a lasting legacy in the competitive pizza market. Locations: 140 Industry: Restaurant Hundal Companies is a family-owned franchise company headquartered in Livermore, California. They have 3 brands — Jamba Juice, Carl's Jr., and Pieology Pizzeria — across 50 locations throughout California and Utah. The Pieology franchises held by Hundal Companies improved their hiring practices by posting job openings efficiently and processing applications faster. For the Pieology brand, having fully staffed restaurants is especially important. Employees guide customers from start to finish in crafting their perfect pizza. As such, they are the face of the brand and are a huge factor in the customer’s overall experience in their store. It takes a lot of employees to keep pizzas flowing smoothly through the line, and because of this Pieology has to hire a lot of people to make sure they are always adequately staffed. Hiring is by far their top challenge. One of the issues they face is recruiting qualified applicants quickly before they sign on for another position elsewhere. Pieology's managers do all their own hiring, but they are often working the line as well, so they are unable to get back to the applicants right away. Once they do, it can be a game of phone tag. And managers often have to use their personal phones to text applicants since younger applicants don't check email as often The manual interviewing and hiring process they had was time-consuming, tedious, and not getting the desired results.

    "text": "How Aspen Healthcare reduced their time to hire by 50% Aspen Healthcare, a senior care company, faced significant hiring challenges, exacerbated by the aftermath of COVID-19 and strict qualification requirements. Yoseli Arrelano, the Recruiting Director, struggled with time-consuming processes, no-show interviews, and a limited applicant pool. However, by implementing Workstream's automation technology, they experienced a 50% reduction in time to hire and a 200% increase in new hires per month, revolutionizing their recruitment process and ensuring top-quality care for patients. “We are in this world to make a difference. I believe people remember you not for what you say but how you make them feel. A lot of people that we hire have that impact on our patients.” Yoseli Arrelano Recruiting Director at Aspen Healthcare The problem Challenges of hiring in the healthcare sector About Aspen Healthcare Aspen Healthcare is a senior care facility and parent company of over 30 other facilities. Their team of highly qualified staff members is passionate about serving and committed to promoting an individual's ability to thrive. Locations: 30+ Industry: Healthcare Since joining the organization last year, Yoseli has been managing all the recruiting for an industry barely recovering from the aftermath of COVID-19. Being in a nursing home with COVID, a lot of people are scared and a lot of people have left the industry. It's been a challenge now more than ever to find quality candidates to provide care for our patients. Yoseli Arrelano Recruiting Director at Aspen Healthcare In the healthcare industry, there’s an added layer of complexity since most applicants need to meet strict qualifications like having certain certifications or meeting a required level of education. Yoseli singlehandedly manages recruiting and hires for several positions across Aspen Health’s 30+ facilities. She’s responsible for everything from setting interview questions to managing the onboarding process—and everything in between—leaving her little time to follow up with applicants and keep them engaged. With every five interviews scheduled, four would no show, losing the organization, especially Yoseli, hours each week. With challenging positions to fill, a time consuming hiring process, and no shows leaving her with a limited applicant pool to hire from, Yoseli knew she needed help. the solution Recruiting automation saves time and cost When Yoseli discovered Workstream’s HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform, she quickly began reaping the benefits of a faster, more streamlined hiring process. Hiring insights Workstream’s built-in applicant tracking capabilities made it easy for Yoseli to manage active job postings across all Apsen Health locations. And with customizable reports, she can regularly check in on how the locations are doing, allowing her to provide added support to those that need it. Smart screening The smart screening feature allows Yoseli to include mandatory questions on licenses and certifications in the application so when unqualified candidates apply, they’re instantly rejected without any action from Yoseli or her hiring managers. Qualified applicants are automatically pushed to the interview stage, saving time by allowing the team to only focus on applicants who meet the position’s requirements. Automated self-scheduling Once an applicant moves to the interview stage, they can schedule their own interviews via text based on the hiring manager’s preset availability. Yoseli’s team saves hours on back-and-froth when applicants schedule their own interviews. Reminders Before Workstream, no shows had always been a problem for Aspen Health. But with automated interview reminders and the ability for applicants to reschedule interviews via text, Yoseli and the team are seeing an improvement in their interview show rate. These reminders also have the added benefit of keeping applicants engaged during the hiring process, and increasing the chances they continue to pursue the opportunity. 200% increase in new hires per month 50% reduction in time to hire built for the hourly workforce How to hire and retain healthcare workers \"Sometimes, what we think is important to our employees is not important to them,” Yoseli says. She advises her recruiters to ask for feedback from applicants and new hires. By following up after the interview, or when the new hire is onboarded, you can learn a lot about your applicant experience and where you could possibly improve. This is how Aspen Healthcare discovered their staff prioritizes insurance benefits (for themselves and their family) over getting a raise. When it comes to retaining employees, Yoseli believes that great management is key. “Employees don’t quit companies, they quit management,” Yoseli says. That is why Aspen Health prioritizes management training and education to create a positive work environment and good relationships. Yoseli takes pride in her work as a recruiter in the healthcare sector. She sees the difference she can make by keeping facilities staffed with qualified professionals who provide top notch healthcare to their patients.

By the time they reopened their doors towards the end of 2020, hiring and retaining staff had become much harder. According to a survey by the National Restaurant Association (NRA), in January 2022, recruiting employees was the top challenge for 53% of operators. Recent data shows that the restaurant industry has filled the labor gap, making up for all lost jobs since February 2020. In fact, the QSR segment even managed to create 100,000 extra jobs. According to the International Franchise Association , employment in QSR is expected to grow by 2.2% in 2024, reaching nearly 4 million employees. Now that the hiring frenzy has subsided and the industry is seeing more steady growth, it’s time for QSR operators to take a breath and refine their HR practices. Instead of hiring anyone as fast as possible, operators and HR leaders should be looking to build longevity within their workforce by hiring top applicants and doing all they can to retain them. In this guide, we'll show you exactly how to do that. We’ve broken down five key strategies for building HR efficiency in 2024. In each section, you’ll find industry data, success stories, actionable tips, and an exercise to get you thinking about how you can implement this advice on the job. Let’s get started! 1. Embrace Gen Z According to a report published in 2021 by Snagajob , in 2020, research estimated that workers under 25 made up 75% of the restaurant workforce and 65% of quick-service workers , as opposed to 7% of Baby Boomers. Characterized by their creativity, adaptability, and resilience, Gen Z make great QSR employees because they often provide fresh ideas, are willing to learn, and can handle the fast-paced environment. QSR managers who want to increase their hiring and retention rates will need to create a hiring process and a workplace that appeals to the younger generation. Tips Provide purpose Compared to older workers, Gen Z employees are less likely to take a job just for the paycheck. Even if they don't plan to carve out a career in QSR, they’ll stick around for longer if they feel that the company’s values align with theirs, that they're not just a number, and that there are opportunities to grow. Offer accommodations Gen Z is more open about discussing physical or mental hurdles and will greatly appreciate employers who offer accommodations. This looks like flexibility around anxiety/panic attacks and special arrangements for employees with ADHD and workers with disabilities. Adding these benefits will show compassion and respect, and respect breeds loyalty. More and more restaurants are aware of that: According to a report by Bentobox , during 2022 and 2023, restaurant job listings used terms such as “health care” 100% more and “mental health” 53% more. Use mobile-friendly tools Gen Z are digital natives who use smartphones as natural extensions. One key element to connecting with them is to provide mobile-friendly tools like apps and text messages throughout the hiring process and in the workplace. Attracting younger employees is not the only good reason to do that, though. Not everyone who applies for a job, especially in the QSR sector, will necessarily own a PC or a tablet, but everyone owns a phone. If you rely too much on desktop-based tools, you may create digital barriers between you and potentially good employees. How Chipotle does it More than 73% of Chipotle’s workforce is made up of Gen Z employees. In 2021 and 2022 , the company faced very high turnover rates of over 190%. To improve retention, in 2024, Chipotle will launch a program to: Help employees pay off student and credit card debt while saving for retirement Offer up to six free sessions with a licensed counselor or mental health coach Provide community support for legal, financial, and family matters Promote career mobility How Gen Z-friendly are your HR practices? Ask yourself these questions to evaluate how friendly your Gen-Z practices are. Download the PDF to print this resource and write in your answers. Do you offer any accommodations for employees facing the following issues? Use the space here to list out your accommodations and gut-check if you’re doing enough: Panic attacks/depression ADHD Physical disabilities Financial hurdles/debt If you do, are they clearly communicated in your job listings, website, and other online channels? Do you use mobile-friendly tools for any of these HR purposes? Candidate application Interview scheduling Onboarding Shift scheduling Team communications 2. Communicate and engage Good communication is important throughout a worker's experience with you—from hiring and onboarding to their day-to-day on the job. In the hiring phase, clear and consistent communication fosters trust and keeps applicants engaged. By keeping applicants informed about the next steps and expectations, you minimize the likelihood of no-shows at interviews and increase the conversion rate of applicants into new hires. Furthermore, transparent communication sets the tone for a positive employer-employee relationship from the outset, laying the foundation for mutual respect and understanding. Once onboarded, ongoing communication remains paramount to maintaining employee engagement and reducing turnover rates. Regular feedback sessions, open channels for dialogue, and transparent communication of goals and expectations empower employees to feel valued and connected. Effective communication fosters a culture of transparency and accountability, where employees feel heard, supported, and motivated to contribute their best efforts. By prioritizing communication at every stage of the employee journey, from recruitment to retention, organizations can cultivate a collaborative and harmonious workplace environment conducive to long-term success and growth. Tips Optimize your job description The job description is your first opportunity to engage potential applicants. Here are three tips to make it stand out: Don't be vague or use boilerplate expressions like “great growth opportunities\" or \"we are looking for a team player.” Be specific about what career advancement is available to high performers and the timeframe. For example: becoming shift lead within six months. Always include hourly pay, but also other benefits. These could have a monetary value, like free meals during shifts, health insurance, or well-being initiatives. Offer flexibility and be specific about how employees can benefit from it, like accommodating shift swaps, or adapting the shifts to each employee's individual needs. Use interviews to get to know applicants Worker-job-fit is important for both the employee and the employer. During the interview, ask meaningful questions to get to know your applicants better and find out what drives them. Show interest in them, making sure that what they’re looking for aligns with the role. Need some inspiration? Below, you’ll find interview questions to help you evaluate applicants across different characteristics: Job experience by role Icebreaker Personality Problem solving Teamwork Conflict resolution Attention to detail Leadership Behavioral Career goals Respond promptly and be approachable Communicate promptly with applicants throughout the process. This shows up in four key ways: The longer it takes you to respond, the less interested they’re likely to be. In looking at our database of 20,000+ customers, we’ve discovered that employers who contact candidates within the first hour of receiving their application have a 25% higher chance of hiring. In addition to being fast, be transparent. Let them know where they are in the process and what is going to happen next. If you’re active as a recruiter, you’re showing you’ll be active as an employer too . Applicants and employees alike should feel that you’re accessible. Provide clear ways for them to contact you, let them know when you're available and when you're not, and encourage them to reach out if they need to. Direct communication tools, such as text-to-apply methods, direct messaging apps, or self-scheduling via text make connecting more straightforward and accessible . Don’t be afraid of employee feedback As a QSR leader, it’s impossible to do everything right all the time. That’s why asking for employees’ feedback is so important. It helps bring to the surface small and big grievances that you wouldn't otherwise be aware of and gives you the opportunity to take action before it impacts retention. Data from employee engagement platform Perceptyx shows that organizations that ask for regular employee feedback are 4x more likely to retain talent than their counterparts, even during times of high attrition. Anonymous surveys can be an effective method of gathering feedback because employees often feel more comfortable sharing their honest opinions. However, your employee feedback strategy should also include regular in-person one-on-one meetings and exit interviews. As for the frequency, you can use a combination of annual in-depth surveys or more frequent pulse surveys. Gathering feedback is only half the process. The next step is to analyze it and follow up with the employees, explaining what actions you'll take to solve the issues. How BCS Northern does it BCS Northern, a 30-location Smoothie King franchise group , reduced no-shows and increased retention by making every touchpoint more engaging. In particular, they: Clearly outlined hourly pay, company values, benefits, and opportunities for growth in their job postings Kept constant communication with applicants, replying promptly to messages and keeping them engaged Strived to find the root cause of why people left the company For more details, listen to our full interview with Ann Miller, HR Manager, BCS Northern. Checklist: 4 opportunities to engage hourly workers Keeping applicants and workers engaged is an important responsibility for any people manager. Make it easier to hit your communication goals by checking in during these key moments in their journey with you. Download the PDF to print out this checklist and use it on the job. When writing job listings, make sure you include: Role description What type of skills you’re looking for Your company values Hourly pay Benefits/accommodations Growth opportunities When screening applicants: Keep them up to date: Let them know where they are in the process, what happens next, and when Encourage them to reach out to ask questions or get updates Keep them up to date even when there’s no update During interviews: Strive to find out more about applicants and what makes them tick Ask questions that resonate with them Consider adapting some of the questions depending on the age of the applicant to relate more to them At the workplace: Be approachable and supportive Ask employees for feedback regularly and follow up on it Always schedule exit interviews with employees who leave 3. Filter everything through the lens of retention After the pandemic, employee turnover in restaurants reached alarming levels. Chipotle, for example, reported rates over 190% . High turnover rates are a huge waste of resources. According to an estimate in the Touchbistro 2024 State of Restaurants report , hiring and training each employee amounts to  $3,600 on average. Such a high cost is not surprising. When you lose an employee, there are tangible costs, like time spent on hiring and onboarding and the costs of placing job ads. However, there are also other repercussions of turnover that impact your bottom line too such as loss of knowledge, more work for the remaining employees, possible loss of engagement, lower productivity, and customer satisfaction issues. To truly understand how much turnover is costing you, you need to total up all the obvious and not-so-obvious factors ( this calculator will help ). The antidote to high turnover is hiring with retention in mind from the start. Look for workers who are less likely to turnover and provide benefits and opportunities that make them want to stick around. Tips Hire strategically Employees are more likely to stick around if they are a good fit for the job. Before starting that hiring process, identify and document the qualities of a successful candidate and communicate them clearly in the job description. When it comes time to source applicants, don’t rely on job boards alone. A diverse sourcing strategy can result in more serious applicants who are looking for your job, not just any job. For example: Ask employees to post on social media about what they love about their job and give them a referral bonus as an incentive if one of their followers is hired Hire from your customer base using posters at your store, printing text-to-apply numbers and QR codes right on your receipts, or getting your team to ask customers if they know anyone who might be interested Reconnect with previous applicants who almost made it, as they might still be available Once you’re ready to interview applicants, clarify the skills and attributes you're assessing and what a good or bad answer looks like. If you’re interviewing for a cook position, you could ask candidates about what they do to ensure that food quality and safety remain high during peak hours or how they contribute to a collaborative work environment in the kitchen. For front-of-house staff, you may want to assess their ability to multitask, deal with customer complaints, and their adaptability to change. Need help coming up with the right interview questions? Borrow from our i nterview question repository . Finally, pay attention to the onboarding process. It may seem like the “hiring” portion of the process is over by then, but onboarding is another opportunity to evaluate your new hire. Onboarding tasks, such as signing company documents or providing payroll information, are some of an employee’s first responsibilities. If they’re unable to follow instructions or try to cut corners, it might indicate that they may not be good at reading a recipe or following simple instructions. Avoid overwork The two most significant operational costs for a restaurant are food and labor. In a time of high inflation, where the former has skyrocketed, it might seem justifiable to cut on the latter, hiring fewer people than needed. While that will save you money in the short term, it will create problems that compound over time, becoming a vicious spiral. In an understaffed restaurant, overworked employees will soon feel stretched too thin and like there’s no room for advancement. What's more, any unexpected event, like a worker becoming sick or experiencing a family emergency, will wreak havoc on the schedule, forcing the manager to ask employees to come to work on their day off or when they’re unavailable. When a scenario like this becomes the norm, it will destroy employees’ engagement. In the worst case, workers may not show up for work at all without giving you any heads-up. No-shows are a huge red flag. They mean that employees have stopped caring about your business and their co-workers. To prevent that, don’t use understaffing as a way to reduce costs . If you find yourself with fewer people than you need, try to bridge the gap as quickly as possible. Pay attention to each shift, ensuring you have the right balance of skills and bodies to keep business running smoothly. When in doubt, ask your employees. If they’re feeling overworked, they’ll let you know. Be flexible In a QSR restaurant, you will have employees with different scheduling needs: from the father of three who needs to work 40 hours a week to support his family to the college student who is only available during weekends. A crucial part of managing hourly staff is putting enough time into building a schedule that tries to meet everyone’s expectations, striking a balance between dependability and humanity. Here are three tips to achieve this balance: Flexibility doesn’t mean inconsistency. A common misconception is that flexibility means having to constantly change the schedule. Hourly workers want predictability and clear expectations. Have policies that enable flexibility but keep everyone on the same page. Invest in shift scheduling tools. They will save time and prevent mistakes while also allowing you to include more personalized shifts than the classic 8-hour block. This will show employees that their well-being and work-life balance are valued. For example, some workers might want to work shorter shifts more often during the week or prefer split shifts. Be fair and transparent . Being flexible doesn't mean accepting all requests from employees all the time. The important thing is to be fair and transparent with denials. There should be no room for personal preferences or even for the idea that there are any. How a QSR operator does it Prior to COVID, Terese Fogleman, a QSR operator in Boone, NC, had an impressive annual turnover rate of 35%, much lower than the industry average. When the QSR industry was hit by the Great Resignation and then inflation, turnover went to 100%. She managed to go back to pre-COVID levels by: Creating a culture of care and respect by always responding to applicants, getting to know them better on a personal level through thoughtful interview questions, and letting employees know that managers are there to help them along the way. Hiring the right leaders. While an HR specialist hires most applicants, Terese personally interviews candidates for leadership positions to make sure they're a good fit with the existing team. She also carefully chooses the managers in charge of scheduling, making sure they're objective and fair. Making a flexible schedule the foundation for managing employees . As most of her employees are students, she keeps the schedule of the local universities and high school up in her office as a reference when building her schedules.

Higher pay Excessive workload Not enough hours scheduled Negative workplace culture Lack of career opportunities Issues with management 4. Lean into technology When you manage multiple locations and a worker population with high turnover, you can’t afford to manually tackle your hiring and HR operations. Sifting through every application and chasing down employees for signatures are tasks that will eat up your time and keep you away from more strategic work. Thankfully, modern technology and automation can help you streamline a lot of your HR workflow. Recent reports paint a clear picture of how restaurant operators are increasingly aware of the benefits of technology: 76% say technology gives them a competitive edge 54% plan to spend more on it in 2024 89% say they are currently using AI-based tools in the back of house Tips Use automation… During the hiring process, there are many ways to automate time-consuming tasks and save hours of work every week. Below are some examples: AI-based applicant assistants to answer frequent questions from candidates QR codes or text-to-apply applications Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen and track applications Online tools that allow applicants to schedule, reschedule, or cancel interviews Messaging tools to send automatic confirmations, updates, or reminders to candidates …but don't lose the human touch Although you can leverage automation and AI for certain tasks, there are certain things you have to do in person, like interviews, exit interviews, or calling applicants to let them know they got the job. Hospitality is a people-centric business, and that applies to customers and workers alike. Look for all-in-one solutions There are tons of great HR solutions out there today. As you start investing in technology, it’s easy to find yourself jumping in and out of different platforms all day long. While technology is great, having too many tools can become inefficient. The average business uses 16 different HR tools alone . Can you imagine managing all that data all over the place? A better approach is to look for all-in-one solutions that enable you to manage as much of your HR workflow and data in one place as possible. Bonus point if it also integrates well with other applications. Workstream , for example, offers hiring, onboarding, operations, payroll, and team communications and integrates with job boards, background check providers, and wotc.com. How Viking Restaurants does it The district manager of Viking Restaurants, a Burger King franchise group managing 26 locations, manually reviewed applications several times a week, contacted applicants one by one over the phone to schedule interviews, and waited for callbacks. After investing in Workstream’s all-in-one HR solution, qualified applicants were automatically able to schedule their own interviews via text based on the hiring managers’ preset availability. This saved the team hours every week and increased their interview rate by 10x. Calculator: How much time can automation save you? The list below contains HR tasks that can be automated. How much time do you spend per week on each of them? Answering basic questions from applicants: _____ hours per week Screening applicants: _____ hours per week Managing applicants’ status: _____ hours per week Scheduling interviews: _____ hours per week Sending transactional messages to applicants and employees, such as confirmations and reminders: _____ hours per week Managing onboarding: _____ p/w Total hours you could save with automation each week: _____ 5. Be proactive Finding people with the right mix of skills and strengths has become very difficult for all sectors. According to 2022 research by the ManpowerGroup, the talent shortage is at an all-time high—71% for restaurants and hotels. Even if you’re not understaffed right now, there are three things you can do to prevent it from happening to you. Tips Build your bench Make sure you always have a pipeline of applicants. Even if you’re not actively hiring right now, as long as you set the right expectations with candidates, you can keep doing interviews all-year round. Instead of paid job listings, use alternative channels like social media posts and ‘now hiring’ signs with QR codes. Find a place for high performers If talent is a hard thing to find, when you do find it, don’t let it go. If you come across high performers, find a place for them in your organization. It might look like an extra cost right now, but those employees may become great leaders and make a difference in your business tomorrow. Forecast hiring needs with data When deciding how many people to hire, many QSR restaurants have to factor in seasonality on top of employee turnover. Throughout the year, your business may go through months of higher or lower demand. Similarly, your turnover may increase periodically due to reasons beyond your control, for example, because you employ a lot of college students who go home for the holidays. By cross-referencing employee turnover and sales data, you can effectively forecast your hiring needs. How Coupa Café does it Coupa Café is a quick-service restaurant chain with eight locations in Palo Alto, California. Using the previous year's sales data to forecast staff needs, they make sure they are fully staffed during the busiest times of the year (graduation month at Stanford University and October) and put a hiring freeze in place before the slow winter season. Listen to the full interview with Alejandra Mier , who is part of the management team at Coupa Café. Checklist: Keep your hiring engine run 24/7 Job listings are not the only way to find applicants. Here are creative ways to keep your hiring engine running 24/7. Free channels you can use: QR or text-to-apply code at the bottom of the receipts Small flyers in to-go or delivery orders Posters on countertops Your own employees Your social media channels Community boards at coffee shops, apartment buildings, gyms, gas stations, etc. Job boards at your local college, university, or technical/trade schools Local events, such as farmers’ markets, concerts, or festivals Conclusion In spite of predictions saying that robots will take over QSR jobs any day now, the restaurant industry remains people-centric and labor-intensive. In fact, it takes 12 employees to generate $1 million in sales in restaurants, which is three times as much as in other sectors. These tips and checklists will help you create a solid structure for your hiring and people management strategy, going from ad to hiring in much less time—while simultaneously reducing turnover.

Or was it? As the HR professional walked into the office, a grim warning awaited her. The company’s latest hiring numbers just came in, frighteningly low. A dark cloud began to loom over the office as others heard the news. Without enough deskless workers, whispers of reduced business hours began. The gloom of lost revenue and decreasing profits was palpable. Existing employees saw terrifying visions of burnout. The curse of not delivering the same level of customer service was becoming all too real. As was the seemingly endless hiring loop the company had been in for weeks. Interviewing, hiring, training, then turnover. And interviewing, hiring, training, and turnover again. Why was this happening? Could anyone—even YOU—fall victim to this horrid fate? Hiring and retaining hourly workers shouldn’t be a nightmare. For HR professionals and hiring managers, the key to overcoming this dark mystery and keeping your business staffed rests on your ability to recognize the three scariest nightmares lurking around the corner and run from them as fast as you can. After years of observing what goes bump in the night, we’ve uncovered the secret to surviving the horror story. The following pages will give you the key to overcoming the three hiring nightmares that every business faces— showing you how to emerge victorious over them and your competition. The Invisible Listing At first glance, this creepy creature appears to be “just another hourly job listing.” And that’s the problem. It starts by posting a job listing only once and expecting applicants to pour in. But they never do. The nightmare caused by the “invisible post” might be terrifying for your business, but it’s a dream come true for those competing with you for talent. When your job postings are generic and impossible to distinguish from those of a competitor, they might as well be invisible. Why you should be afraid Competition is stiff as a corpse. Don’t risk losing qualified applicants to someone else. Without a steady flow of applicants, it becomes almost impossible to find the right fit. Unappealing job listings can actually drive potential workers away from your business. How to overcome The Invisible Listing Make every job posting appealing and detailed, and promote it in as many places as possible. Here's how: Don't be generic or reliant on templates. Ready-made job descriptions are great for getting started. But don't stop there. Take the extra step to adapt any template you use with the unique or special aspects of your role and the company. Resist the urge to use a \"clever\" job title. \"Kitchen wizard\" may seem interesting or fun, but applicants search for phrases like \"line cook\" or job titles featuring must-have skills. Make job listings scannable. People won't read every word of your job listing. So break up big paragraphs, leave out industry jargon, and use bulleted lists. Don't ask for unnecessary job \"requirements.\" Too many skill expectations in a job listing can scare people. Which ones are truly necessary? Are you able to teach others? Never limit yourself to one online job board. Most employers only know of job boards like Indeed or Monster. A hiring platform like Workstream can post to 25,000+ job boards for you. Try new alternatives to the \"help wanted\" sign . QR codes and text-to-apply codes let applicants see your job listing on promotional materials and easily apply on their phones. Show applicants their job has a future. Add concrete job advancement opportunities to your job postings to outline the unique career progression offered at your organization. Don't believe us? Aaron Piper, Director of Operations for Dunkin Donuts/Baskin Robbins (OM Group ), streamlined his hiring process and overcame the nightmare of unseen job listings using text-to-apply codes. “If we had known it was going to be as easy and user-friendly and really help drive the applicant flow in our restaurants, we would have probably started with all our restaurants from the beginning.” Not only has using Workstream's text-to-apply feature kept Piper's restaurants consistently staffed, but it's also increased spontaneous applications from customers, flooding their applicant pool with fans of their brand. The Application Apparition Your applicant seems promising—until they mysteriously transform into a “no show.” Today’s applicants often ghost interviews simply because they have options. With a shortage of talent in many industries, candidates can pick and choose where they end up. But other times, it’s the fault of the employer. When employers take too long to respond to job seekers after they apply, applicants lose interest and start looking elsewhere. It can give the impression that you regard them as a bag of bones. This nightmare can also manifest itself whenever job candidates think the hiring manager acted unprofessionally, received a bad impression of your business, or simply feel misled. Why you should be afraid Candidates who ghost you could end up with your competitors. Ghosting prolongs the hiring process, which adds more work (and stress) to current staff. Time spent, and ultimately wasted, by no-shows can negatively affect the bandwidth of hiring teams. How to overcome The Application Apparition If you don’t respond to applicants quickly, your competition will. Keep your applicants engaged throughout the hiring process so they feel seen and don’t forget about your opportunity. Here’s how: Respond to applicants as quickly as possible. Once the application is submitted, the clock is ticking. Reaching out within 24-48 hours shows you respect them and their time. Use their preferred methods of communication. Recent data suggests that 75% of millennials ignore phone calls. Yet, text open rates are as high as 98% (which is a big deal since email open rates are only 20%!) Send confirmations before the interviews. Minimize ghosting with an automated system that sends texts to confirm (and remind) your job candidates about upcoming interviews. Screen out people before they can ghost. Smart screen technology can automatically filter out candidates who don't meet your qualifications or will otherwise waste your time. Bring up benefits from the start. By giving applicants visibility into perks like employee discounts, tuition assistance, or health insurance, you'll motivate them to follow through. Don't believe us? Luke Godwin, General Manager and Owner of Godwin Motors, experienced a drastic reduction in no-shows when he incorporated an automated text system into his hiring process. “Using the automatic text is a big deal. Calling somebody is pretty much useless, but being able to text that applicant on the day before their interview, or the morning before their interview, or five minutes before their interview, that creates a big difference in whether they show up or not.” The Disarrachnid This menace creeps in slowly. Most of us hardly notice its presence until it’s too late. Hiring is a time-intensive process dotted with logistical details. It involves filtering applicants, looking for the right qualifications, and setting up interviews. And those in HR and Ops must tackle these tasks while they’re still tangled up with other day-to-day job responsibilities. After the job offer is accepted, the dire web of inefficiency can continue to engulf its victims. There are background checks to complete, I-9s to collect, and new hires to get into the system—all very detailed and important work. Why you should be afraid Being disorganized slows response time, which can cause you to lose good candidates. Screening each candidate manually leaves you open to mistakes and lost opportunities. Poor planning can cause you to spend too much energy on the wrong candidates. How to overcome The Disarrachnid Implement technology that manages and automates the hiring process for you—from sourcing and screening to interview scheduling and onboarding. Crush The Disarrachnid with technology that allows you to: Manage every job posting on every job board at once. With the right technology, you can integrate with over 25,000 job boards to cast a wider net for suitable job candidates. Screen applicants automatically. Smart screening automatically rejects unqualified applicants while pushing qualified applicants to the next stage of your hiring process. Schedule interviews automatically. Enable applicants to self-schedule their interviews based on your availability, reducing back and forth. Get new hires onboarded digitally, not manually. Send out W2 forms, employee handbooks, and training videos links to speed up your hiring process. Don't believe us? Derrick Sousley, Vice President of Operations for the Indiana Hospitality Group, knows firsthand the advantages realized by using text and automation hiring technology. “Our general managers, and even our above-property managers, would spend half of their day going through applications, screening, emailing, texting, and messaging people—a lot of times who never called you back, never responded. And now, they’re just scheduled, they come for the interview, you pull up their resume…it’s definitely reduced the hiring-time process by 50%.” Beat the hiring horrors that go bump in the night At some point, every HR professional, hiring manager, or business owner has experienced the three hiring nightmares we’ve detailed in this guide. Fortunately, Workstream can provide you with the key to overcoming these common, terrifying (yet avoidable) hiring nightmares.
