But did you know that the first recognizable social media platform was only created in 1997? Even then, the concept of social media did not pick up until the early 2000s when sites like Friendster and Facebook gained traction as more people started registering themselves on the platforms. While some of these sites are still relevant today, others have dwindled to be replaced by new ones. One of the newer and more popular ones today is the short-form video app, TikTok . Holding the top position for the most downloaded app worldwide in May 2021, TikTok is used primarily by millennials and Gen Zs. Almost 80% of users are below 39 years old‚Äîso if you're looking for a way to reach this generation of individuals, you know where to go. This platform‚Äôs appeal spans across various demographics, making it an ideal platform to connect with a diverse audience. TikTok first garnered popularity for its insane dance challenges and in-app filters. But as more users climb on board this platform, the content shared is becoming more diverse as well. Gone were the days when TikTok was used only for entertainment purposes. Now, professionals are using the platform to share useful how-tos for the budding generation entering the workforce soon. Likewise, promising young talents are also using this platform to get some tips for their career growth and even to look for job opportunities. Sounds like a great platform to recruit your potential hires, right? As TikTok gains more popularity day by day, many companies are using its reach to recruit talent in various fields. From content creators to project managers , TikTok has become a platform of choice for companies seeking diverse skill sets. Additionally, marketing managers are tapping into TikTok 's potential to enhance their digital marketing strategies, utilizing the platform to reach broader audiences and boost e-commerce businesses. TikTok hiring may sound unconventional, but it's likely to become the norm shortly. In this article, we'll discuss how the social media app can be used for professional goals and how you, as an employer, can leverage this to amp up your hiring strategy! The up-and-coming working population: Gen Z Before we get started, let‚Äôs talk about our up-and-coming working generation, Gen Z. In case you‚Äôre unsure, this is the generation of people born from 1997 to 2015, which means they have either just started working or will eventually start looking for jobs in the coming years. More notably, they make up the bulk of our hourly or part-time workforce and should be your hiring manager‚Äôs right market. This is especially so if your business depends on hourly staff who are usually college students looking for a side income to support their living expenses. Individuals from Gen Z are known as our first ‚Äúdigital natives‚Äù‚Äîthat is, they grew up with technology and live and breathe it. So it's unsurprising that more than half (60%) of TikTok users in the US are Gen Z-ers. And with 74 million people making up this generation in the US next year, Gen Z-ers will be the trendsetters of the country as they will form the largest generation. In today's dynamic job market, staying informed about new job opportunities is essential for job seekers. Platforms like TikTok can serve as effective channels for job alerts , providing timely notifications about available positions like content creators and any job titles that match a candidate's interests and qualifications. With TikTok 's wide reach and engagement, job alerts can reach a diverse audience of potential candidates, ensuring that new job opportunities are quickly disseminated and filled. Similarly, for businesses looking to attract top talent, utilizing TikTok to promote job alerts and showcase new job openings can be a strategic approach. By leveraging TikTok 's platform, companies can effectively target job seekers across America , reaching a broad audience of American professionals and encouraging them to explore new career opportunities. With TikTok 's popularity among American users, businesses can maximize their recruitment efforts and connect with a vast pool of talented individuals actively seeking new jobs . That being said, if you're looking for ways to reach this particular population, incorporating TikTok job alerts and new job postings into your hiring strategy should be on your list of considerations. After all, what better way to stay ahead of the competition than by leveraging innovative recruitment methods and reaching potential candidates where they are most active? Going beyond entertainment Getting interview and career tips We‚Äôve mentioned how TikTok users utilize the app to access professional tips when securing a job. Sure, there are other ways one can do that, even without using the app. So what makes TikTok job content any different? Well, for one, educational content posted on TikTok is more digestible and engaging. According to Ms. Ordonez Celi, her key point was learning a lot in just 15- or 60-seconds. Experts in the field often create these videos and they can usually be found under the hashtag #CareerTok. Ms. Emily Durham, a senior recruiter at Intuit, for example, decided to upload videos to equip interviewees with basic interview skills after encountering many lacking candidates. Below is one of her TikTok uploads. TikTok 's platform offers a unique space for professionals to share insights and advice, making it an invaluable resource for job seekers whether full-time or part-time . From program managers to product managers , experts across various industries leverage TikTok to provide valuable career guidance and interview tips. Moreover, the TikTok content format allows users to consume information quickly, ensuring that job-related content is easily accessible and actionable. Furthermore, TikTok 's algorithmic features, such as meta and LinkedIn platforms, ensure that relevant career content reaches the right audience at the right time. Unlike traditional job-seeking platforms, TikTok is a more effective platform for jobs and career tips, providing users with a diverse range of perspectives and strategies for navigating the job market. @emily.the.recruiter Save this video to practice for any interview üí¨ #careertips #interviewtip #interviewpractice #careergoals #fyp ‚ô¨ original sound - Emily Durham Using it as a recruitment platform Aside from its purpose of spreading useful advice, TikTok has recently developed a pilot program that can help job seekers connect with employers using the hashtag #TikTokResumes. Though most of its users are still young and lacking experience, they will eventually be looking for jobs as full-time or part-time working adults who are still going through college. In other words, it provides hiring managers with another recruitment platform to attract the younger generation. The program allows users to directly apply to a group of companies, which includes Chipotle and Target , by submitting a video resume using the app. This allows recruiters to get to know the applicant better, as their personality will likely be reflected in their videos. As a guide, the TikTok Resume page will also feature outstanding video resumes and users who create content relating to career advice. TikTok 's emergence as a recruitment platform signifies its evolution beyond entertainment to a hub for career-related content. With features tailored for content creation and content moderation , TikTok serves as an ideal platform for influencer marketing and social media marketing initiatives. Businesses can leverage the platform's wide reach and engagement to promote job opportunities and attract top talent. Additionally, TikTok 's integration of features like TikTok Shop and business development tools provides hiring managers with innovative ways to showcase company culture and attract potential candidates. Furthermore, TikTok 's platform offers various roles such as media specialist , social media manager , and account manager , allowing companies to recruit individuals with expertise in managing online presence and customer relationships. By tapping into TikTok 's diverse community and dynamic content ecosystem, businesses can enhance their recruitment efforts and connect with a broader audience of job seekers. @makena.yee Here are the reasons why YOU should hire me! Don't be shy, let's get in touch. ##tiktokresumes ##tiktokpartner ‚ô¨ original sound - MAKENA Example of #TikTokResumes Staffing your store can be difficult. However, by using an alternative platform like TikTok for jobs, you can widen your reach for candidates and possibly gain more success in hiring employees for your business. What‚Äôs more, with the unconventional recruitment process, you can even make hiring more interesting. Incorporating TikTok into your hiring strategy With programs such as #TikTokResumes being implemented, naturally, TikTok serves as a viable platform for you to hire hourly employees. But how does this improve your hiring strategy? Well, for one, it allows you to learn more about your candidate and thus lets you decide whether he/she is the right fit for the job. And as we‚Äôve mentioned before, the majority of the Gen Z population is on it. Using TikTok for jobs increases your brand awareness and broadcasts your hiring campaign to more people. E-commerce giant Amazon uses TikTok 's diverse user base and engaging platform for creative and targeted ad campaigns to reach potential candidates. Where there is a marketing campaign from any company there is the job. You can try out to reach certain brands for promotional jobs. TikTok recruiting has proven effective for some brands. Chipotle, for example, saw a 7% increase in applicants last August after posting their recruitment video. This was part of the fast-food brand‚Äôs recruiting strategy to hire 10,000 new employees. And it does help that their content was hilarious and entertaining enough to rope in more viewers, ultimately allowing the video to reach a wider audience. Check out their TikTok video below. In addition to traditional recruiting methods, incorporating TikTok into your hiring strategy offers unique opportunities for optimization and engagement. By leveraging features like TikTok Live and social media content creation , businesses can showcase their company culture and values in real time, fostering authentic connections with potential candidates. Moreover, TikTok 's algorithmic capabilities enable targeted optimization of recruitment campaigns, ensuring that job postings reach the most relevant audience and maximize applicant engagement. Whether through live recruitment events or optimized job postings, TikTok offers a dynamic platform for companies to connect with the next generation of job seekers and build a strong employer brand presence. @chipotle We're hiring 10,000 people. Link in bio to apply. #chipotle #careers #job #fyp ‚ô¨ Swear By It - Clutch So how exactly should you start using TikTok for jobs? Here are three easy steps you can follow to ensure that you reap the full benefits of TikTok hiring: 1. Set Goals for Your Campaign First and foremost, set a goal for your TikTok hiring strategy. Is your main purpose to increase your number of applicants by garnering a wider reach through social media ? Or do you wish to create higher brand awareness? If it‚Äôs the former, you may consider creating video content that shows the step-by-step application process. If you use automated hiring tools such as those provided by Workstream , you can show how streamlined your hiring process is by portraying the minimal steps they have to take to apply for a position. Setting a goal helps to steer you in the right direction when planning your content calendar. 2. Plan Your Budget Wisely After you‚Äôve set your goals, decide where you want to spend your money. To gain followers on TikTok , you first need to get your content in front of as many users as possible. You can do this either via TikTok advertising or through influencers . When done right, TikTok advertising will help you achieve a higher reach by finding the right users who engage in content categories related to your brand. And if they like your content, they will come back to stay updated with your page and might even share your videos with other users. Eventually, you'll gain a loyal following and won't need to spend as much to advertise your account. As for the use of influencers , Candice Beck, Senior Manager of Social and Digital at Chipotle, advised getting someone who is a genuine fan of your brand so that they can create authentic content. Ensure that their followers engage with their posts as well, since the main point of employing influencers is so that your brand can get a more widespread audience. 3. Post the Right Content Before you dive straight into creating content for your company, be sure to set your brand‚Äôs voice as you would want to ensure your content is in line with it. For example, if your company is looking to hire people with a sense of humor, upload comedic skits to reel them in. To attract potential hourly workers on TikTok , it's crucial to create engaging and authentic content. Avoid using scripted or overly promotional content. Instead, showcase your company culture, work environment, and the benefits of working with your organization in a fun and creative way. Authenticity is key to resonating with potential hourly workers and getting them interested in joining your team. You should also use hashtags. Using relevant hashtags can help your content reach a wider audience. Research popular hashtags related to hourly work, such as #hiring, #jobsearch, or #hourlyjobs, and incorporate them into your TikTok videos. This will help your content get discovered by potential hourly workers who are actively searching for job opportunities on TikTok . Consider creating a catchy branded hashtag. This reflects the company culture and will inspire new content if the hashtag takes off. You can also encourage your staff to use the hashtag whenever they post something relevant to your brand. This can give potential hourly workers a glimpse into what it's like to work with your organization and help build trust and credibility. Employee-generated content can be highly authentic and resonate with job seekers looking for insights from current employees before applying for a job. 4. Collaborate With Influencers Identify influencers whose content aligns with your company's values, culture, and industry niche. Look for influencers who have a strong following and engagement on TikTok , as they can effectively amplify your message to a broader audience. Collaborate with them to create engaging and authentic content that highlights your employer's brand, job opportunities, and company culture. Encourage influencers to share their personal experiences working with your organization, showcasing the benefits and opportunities available to employees. Authentic storytelling can help humanize your employer brand and attract candidates who are genuinely interested in joining your team. In addition to promoting job openings, influencers can also provide valuable insights and advice to their followers about career development, resume tips, interview techniques, and more. This educational content not only positions your company as a thought leader in the industry but also adds value to the TikTok community. FAQ How do I get Hired by TikTok ? To get hired by TikTok , start by creating an account on TikTok 's careers site. You'll find options to log in using various methods. It's recommended to utilize the careers site for a fair assessment. TikTok values excellence, teamwork, forward-thinking, open communication, and a passion for technology. In your application, highlight these traits based on your experiences. Do TikTok Employees Work from Home? TikTok has tightened its stance on remote work, following a trend seen in many other tech companies. Remote employees at TikTok have been cautioned against living too far from a physical office, as this could lead to termination. This move aligns TikTok with other tech firms that are also reducing remote work options. Can you Work at TikTok Without a Degree? At TikTok , there are no strict requirements regarding academic achievement, such as GPA or specific degrees. However, including your academic achievements on your CV/resume is recommended. While a degree may not be mandatory, showcasing relevant education and skills can strengthen your application and demonstrate your qualifications for the role. Is TikTok the Future of Social Media ?

Projections indicate a rapid expansion of 9.3% between 2023 and 2024, followed by 7% between 2024 and 2025. In contrast, Facebook's growth is anticipated to be less than 1% during the same period, contrary to Zuckerberg's predictions. What are the Available Career Opportunities at TikTok ? TikTok prioritizes content creators , valuing the creative potential of every user. Whether you're crafting content on the app or seeking a career opportunity within TikTok , everyone is a creator. Explore TikTok 's diverse career paths below: Marketing TikTok content creator Account Manager Content Writer Social Media Manager Client Services Operations Operations Associate Sales TikTok Ads Expert Content Executive Content Moderator Software Engineer Where are TikTok Offices?

Summing up TikTok has gained many users in recent years, most of whom are Gen Z-ers. As they are the ones who will be joining the workforce soon, having your hiring campaign on TikTok may be more effective than using traditional methods. With initiatives such as #TikTokResumes, this unconventional way of hiring allows you to know your applicants a bit better through videos. Likewise, they will also have a better idea of your company culture through your company‚Äôs TikTok account. In TikTok , anyone can find a job through specific job communities or companies, whether they are English or Spanish or anywhere in the world. When using TikTok to hire hourly workers, it's important to make the application process as easy as possible.

Keep the application process simple and user-friendly to increase the likelihood of job seekers taking action and applying for your open positions .

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Company news 11/28/23 Everything you need to know about hiring accommodations Share this article Workers with disabilities have been highly undervalued in the workplace. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , only 21.3% of people with a disability were employed in 2022, compared to 65.4% of people without a disability. On top of that, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is twice as high. Many people with disabilities want to and can contribute to a company, but employers have to find these individuals and give them a fair shot at succeeding during the hiring process. Accommodations are a significant way companies can ensure that people with disabilities have a fair hiring process. Let‚Äôs dive into what accommodations are and how to use them to find top, diverse talent. What Are Accommodations? Accommodations are a set of actions that help people who need flexibility. Most often, we think of accommodations in school as our classmates may have gone to an extra class or gotten more time to take a test. Laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act in the United States have given this subset of people more protected rights and freedoms in life, school, and work. How How are accommodations used during the hiring process? We‚Äôve already established how the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to employers. While anyone you hire should meet the standards of the role and be able to do the job, you should also ensure that you give workers the material they need to do it effectively. You should provide reasonable accommodations to your potential and current employees. What kind of accommodations might apply to the hiring process? After a person has disclosed their disability, you should ensure you meet them where they are. Here are a few ideas of accommodations employers can offer: Providing materials in an accessible way (audio, visual, large-print, etc.) Ensuring that the interviews, conversations, and assessments are held in a way that is accessible to the interviewee. Offering extra time to complete timed assessments or take-home exercises. Providing translators and interpreters to make the communication process easier. Some people may not want to disclose their disability immediately due to the discrimination they have felt with past employers. It is not up to HR or hiring managers to try and get workers to disclose by asking illegal interview questions . It‚Äôs important to vet the questions in applications, interviews, and passing conversations. Asking illegal interview questions can get a company in trouble, and it looks bad to potential workers. How to create your company‚Äôs hiring accommodations policy Accommodations can make a difference in hiring a more diverse workforce . As your team branches out to find workers from community-based organizations , job posting sites , and even agencies , you must create great policies that help you standardize the hiring process. Here are some must-know tips to help you create the best experience: Write Down Your Accommodations Policy And Share It Company-Wide If you are in HR, you know that a written policy is best. Disability-related charges make up around one-third of EEOC charges each year . Creating a policy that keeps your company safe while helping you see more candidates is important. Get explicit about what your company considers a reasonable accommodation and ensure hiring managers know how to access these resources/make the necessary changes. For example, if you want to offer extended time on a timed assessment, provide instructions on making this change in the software and getting that link to the right person. If the process isn‚Äôt crystal clear, it may be easy for some staffers to skip over your policy. You should also define the types of disabilities (invisible and visible) so that your team knows to be sensitive to how diverse the needs of potential employees are. Disclose Your Policy During The Hiring Process As we‚Äôve shared, some potential workers may not disclose right away. They may have experienced discrimination or feel their disability isn‚Äôt severe enough. Sharing can be challenging if you aren‚Äôt comfortable with strangers knowing your diagnosis. Disclosing your policy isn‚Äôt the same as a checklist of potential disabilities at the end of an application. It‚Äôs taking a step back and explaining how you approach disabilities within your company. Instead of asking employees to check a box, share your policies around diversity, disabilities, and accommodations in the application. After you receive the finished application, follow up and let workers know that they can call, text, or email a team member to disclose if they feel comfortable doing so . This strategy allows candidates to understand where you stand before they have an option to disclose anything to you. Audit Your Hiring Process To Ensure Disability Disclosure Doesn‚Äôt Impact Potential Workers Auditing your process is essential when revealing any new process or policy. Creating a policy around discrimination and accommodations can backfire and make your company even less diverse. It‚Äôs crucial to compare hiring numbers (applicants, people called for an interview, offers extended, hires, people who make it to the first year, etc.) as well as having actual conversations with your employees. Mixing quantitative and qualitative data will help you understand whether your new strategy is working. Conclusion Workers with disabilities are an integral part of the workforce. Companies need workers from a variety of backgrounds to create a great place to work. Building your company‚Äôs accommodations policy ensures that everyone gets a fair shot of succeeding during the hiring process. Without a clear policy, employee bias and discrimination can run rampant and stop companies from hearing new voices and expertise. Whether you are just getting started or revamping your accommodations policy, there‚Äôs value in considering your company‚Äôs core values and building a plan that highlights your team's best attributes.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Company news 08/29/23 Workstream your way: Introducing HR management tools for your growing business Share this article So many franchise and QSR owners I speak to tell me that growing their business comes with unique challenges they weren‚Äôt anticipating. You‚Äôre suddenly at a stage where you‚Äôre spending more time in spreadsheets and bogged down with paperwork when you should be engaging your staff and charting your next phase of growth. But when you look into the typical HR solutions on the market, they seem like they were built for someone else. Not only are they expensive, they‚Äôre cumbersome and filled with features you don‚Äôt need. Workstream was founded on the belief that the deskless economy deserves better. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre excited to introduce new HR management products designed to help your company in its next phase of growth‚Äîand give your hourly workers the time, attention, and resources they deserve without overextending yourself in the process.These products include: Document and Signature Management Onboarding Worker Records Team Communications Engagement Surveys Scale up without slowing down 83% of the deskless workforce still uses paper processes. When you‚Äôre doing all your admin work manually, it‚Äôs no wonder that scaling up your business can feel like being chained to your desk. To successfully grow your business, you need to evolve beyond the old-fashioned way of doing things. If you‚Äôre finding yourself always stuck in the back office, it‚Äôs time to look for solutions that streamline and digitize all those tedious or manual processes. Workstream‚Äôs new HR management tools are here to help you tackle back-office operations as efficiently as possible‚Äîall without the clunky platforms or confusing features you don‚Äôt need. Streamline onboarding : Improve the worker experience and decrease premature staff turnover within the first 90 days using mobile-friendly digital paperwork and e-signatures. Make all your documents accessible : Get documents signed and stored without chasing down your employees whenever an updated policy or form requires their attention. Keep worker information secure : Close your filing cabinet for the last time knowing you can securely access any worker information or documents you need, entirely online. Connect with your team often By automating and digitizing this work, you free up time to focus on your new hire experience‚Äîwhich is pretty important. Just because your company is growing doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean your employees will decide to grow with it. In 2022, only 54% of quick-service employees reached their 90-day milestone before quitting. When replacing an employee costs as much as 60% of their annual pay , focusing on retention is a much better use of your time than chasing down employees to fill out a form‚Äîand can help you maximize profits by up to 4X . With time back to focus on your team, you might be left wondering where to begin. Like any successful relationship, it starts with communication. Creating an open and safe space to share information, engage with workers, and solicit feedback can go a long way in making your team feel comfortable and appreciated. We‚Äôre tackling this head-on by giving you two easy ways to increase communication with your team. Team Communications : In today‚Äôs world, everyone‚Äôs inundated with messages. Cut through the noise with a smart blend of automation and personalization‚Äîso you can connect with your team, keep them informed, and increase overall team efficiency and output. Engagement Surveys : Collect worker feedback often with automated engagement surveys‚Äîso you can address problems, keep workers happy (and make them less likely to turnover!) Put compliance and back-office operations on autopilot One of the biggest concerns you‚Äôll face when running a successful business is keeping data secure and documents up to date for your growing team of hourly workers‚Äîall across different locations. The annual costs from U.S. businesses that fail to comply with regulations total around $14.82 million . It‚Äôs a challenge many businesses fail to get right, but you can easily avoid it with the right HR tech managing the headaches for you. Imagine putting your compliance tasks on autopilot. Our platform manages the complexities of HR and tax forms so you can feel confident your business is compliant ‚Äîwithout having to become an expert overnight. Updated Worker Records: With digital document signing delivered to workers via text, keep records updated with the latest information easily.

Six years later, the speed of innovation has introduced a new chapter in what‚Äôs possible through technology. AI, or artificial intelligence, is already transforming every industry it touches, and we immediately recognized the potential it holds to make the smarter way to hire and retain hourly workers even smarter . Today, we‚Äôre excited to announce a new chapter in our journey as we integrate the power of AI into our platform. Workstream AI is our commitment to developing AI technology tailored specifically to meet the unique needs of the hourly workforce. Our goal is not just to implement AI for the sake of it but to unlock better experiences for applicants, workers, and managers alike. We‚Äôre taking a deep look at the Workstream platform and finding opportunities to enhance how you source, communicate, hire, onboard, retain, and more. And that means building AI that feels like an extension of your recruiting team and your brand‚Äînot like a robot. Our journey starts with Workstream Assistant, a chat-apply experience built by our team with artificial intelligence experience from MIT, Google, Cornell, and Stanford. So many AI chatbots on the market today claim to do the exact same thing. They promise to provide a smooth application process for workers and a hands-off sourcing and screening tool for hiring managers. But all too often, they fail to deliver on that promise. We‚Äôve seen how easy it is for applicants to accidentally ‚Äúbreak‚Äù a bot by asking questions outside of what it has been pre-programmed to answer. And language barriers and typos can make texting with a bot harder than talking to a human. We‚Äôre building Workstream Assistant to solve those problems and so much more. At its core, Workstream Assistant is personal, flexible, and customizable . It gives businesses the freedom to own their AI experience so it feels like your technology, not ours. At the same time, for applicants, it barely feels like technology at all. They can‚Äôt ‚Äúbreak it‚Äù with the wrong question. They can speak to it in any language they feel comfortable in. And they can get a real feel for the job and the company they‚Äôre applying for by asking the questions they might be too nervous to ask in an interview. Beta customers today are already leveraging Workstream Assistant to: Customize AI for their brand : Our AI learns your brand's unique voice, enabling you to create a more personalized and engaging experience for applicants right from the start. Break language barriers: Applicants can chat in any language they feel comfortable with, unlocking a greater portion of the applicant pool. Have authentic conversations: Gone are the days of robotic and formulaic conversations. We've designed Workstream Assistant to engage in human-like conversations, incorporating typos, slang, and personal preferences. Applicants will feel like they're interacting with a real person, fostering a genuine connection. And there is so much more to come! We envision a future where our tool not only gives you another way to source applicants but it improves the quality of your applicants, makes it easier for your workers to answer on-the-job questions, and empowers your leaders with insights, transforming how you run your business. We are so excited by the possibilities Workstream AI can unlock for workers and leaders in the hourly workforce, and we want you to join us. I‚Äôm thrilled to invite you to sign up for the Workstream AI beta . You‚Äôll be one of the first to try Workstream Assistant and get early access to other AI products and updates as they become available. And if you‚Äôre already a Workstream customer, I encourage you to try our existing job description optimizer powered by Workstream AI. It leverages thousands of data points to optimize existing job descriptions or create new ones from scratch in just one click‚Äîsaving you hours each week. Just log in to your account and create or edit a job description to give it a try. The deskless economy deserves better. This has been our mantra since day one. It‚Äôs why we started Workstream. As technology continues to advance, we promise to bring it to the hourly workforce and the leaders who manage them‚Äîand tailor it to help you do your jobs better.

This is a big milestone in our mission to serve the deskless economy and to build the first people software designed for the deskless worker. More than two dozen investors are participating in the oversubscribed extension round, including both institutional funds and angel investors. Led by Hans Tung, Managing Partner of GGV Capital, with strong participation from new and existing investors, notably Founders Fund, Coatue, BOND, Basis Set Ventures, CRV, World Innovation Lab (WiL), Peterson Ventures, Soma Capital, CE Innovation Capital, Burst Capital, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell, Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, former COO of Stripe Claire Hughes Johnson, Arielle Zuckerberg, Gaingels, Lachy Groom, Front CEO Mathilde Collins, Lattice CEO Jack Altman, and more. This financing enables us to double down on our mission of serving the deskless workforce, which continues to endure post-COVID and the Great Resignation. And with this elite group of strategic investors, we can accelerate our work towards our mission in three powerful ways. 1. Expanding into new industries Our two-way text and automation technology has helped over 4,000 companies across 24,000 locations. More than 170 of the top quick-service restaurant (QSR) brands in the world, including Burger King, Dairy Queen, and Jimmy John's, are already finding success with Workstream, with some customers decreasing their time to hire by as much as 70%. In helping so many leaders in the QSR space, we‚Äôve been made increasingly aware of other industries in the deskless economy that share these same challenges. Specifically, these industries include retail, hospitality, healthcare, warehousing, and automotive. ‚ÄúWorkstream has seen tremendous momentum in the last year. We‚Äôre excited to see Workstream continue to expand into new verticals, in particular the retail sector. 60% of the U.S. workforce does not sit at a desk to do their job, and we‚Äôre delighted to see Workstream continue to build technology to support this group.‚Äù ‚Äî Hans Tung, Managing Partner of leading investor GGV Capital. We already support many leading brands outside of the QSR space, including Marriott International, Holiday Inn, Ace Hardware, UPS, European Wax Center, Nurse Next Door, and RaceTrac. As part of this funding round, we‚Äôre adding strategic expertise in these industries, including: Aglae Ventures, the technology investment firm backed by Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy ‚Äì Louis Vuitton Nationwide Ventures, the venture capital arm of Nationwide Insurance Company of America which serves hundreds of thousands of businesses across retail, hospitality, warehousing, auto, and restaurants CE Innovation Capital, a $1 billion global venture fund investing in fintech, enterprise solutions, consumer technologies, e-commerce platforms, and digital-tech driven companies Jay Z‚Äôs RocNation with broad investments across hospitality, retail, and more Wheelhouse Capital, with extensive experience in logistics and the airline industry Gold House Ventures, with a strong network across hospitality, retail, and restaurant investments Dawn Dobras, former Gap Inc SVP and former CEO of Credo Beauty Jonson Chen, Chairman of Tawa Supermarket and Board member of California Grocery Association Bracken Darrell, CEO of Logitech, a multinational leader in logistics and manufacturing World Innovation Lab (WiL), a US- and Japan-based fund backed by a strong network of corporates in multiple sectors spanning consumer and retail, automotive, and manufacturing and logistics, with investments in healthcare and transportation Liquid 2 Ventures, founded by NFL hall of fame quarterback Joe Montana With new support from experts in industries beyond QSR, we know we can better serve more of the deskless economy and bring the same wins we‚Äôve seen to date to even more workers and business leaders. 2. Investing in product innovation We started Workstream after experiencing firsthand the lack of technology for the deskless workforce. My parents are both hourly workers, and in the early days of my career, I employed hourly workers at my restaurant. It was always astounding to me how many tools and technologies were being developed for the office workforce while the deskless economy was largely ignored. When building Workstream, we prioritized products and features that would have the greatest impact on those who work in this fast-paced, on-the-go environment: two-way texting, automation, QR and text-to-apply codes, templates, and more. Our Hiring product has revolutionized how businesses source applicants, screen applications, and schedule interviews. We recently launched Employee Onboarding , which extends the same text and automation functionality to the new hire paperwork process enabling businesses to collect and store documents and signatures digitally. What used to be a manual and tedious process now takes HR leaders less than 10 minutes to complete. ‚ÄúWith Workstream‚Äôs Hiring product, we‚Äôve reduced our application to hire timeline down to about three days, which is fantastic for us. We saw a high this year of a 71% show rate for interviews, which is outstanding. Also, the Onboarding product has helped smooth out our applicant and manager experiences by keeping everything in one place. There is really nothing that the employee has to provide, sign, or complete outside of Workstream Onboarding.‚Äù ‚ÄîAmy Parman, Director of Training & Recruiting at Taziki‚Äôs Mediterranean Cafe With this funding, we will continue to invest in building the products and features our customers are asking for and find new ways to streamline how the deskless economy hires and retains their employees. 3. Fueling growth when the deskless economy needs it most Economic instability is impacting every industry from tech to hospitality to retail. We know our customers are feeling the shift as much as their customers are, and we want to help. In talking with experts across the industries impacted the most , we‚Äôve learned that maintaining a full staff is one of the best strategies a business can rely on right now. As people reevaluate how and where they spend their money, they‚Äôre looking for value and an elevated customer experience that understaffed businesses just can‚Äôt provide. This round reinforces the importance of our vision for Workstream. We see a future where everyone employed in the deskless economy can support themselves, their families, and their passions. And with Workstream, back office operations are fully automated, and managers are free to spend time where it counts‚Äîwith their team and their customers. The deskless economy deserves better Hourly workers and the leaders who hire them have historically lacked the tools and technologies the rest of the workforce relies on to find and fill meaningful jobs. This gap is punctuated by the fact that turnover rates among deskless workers are much higher on average. For example, the leisure industry alone lost 833,000 workers in just the month of July , leaving HR leaders scrambling to fill positions with disparate systems and outdated hiring processes. From day one, our goal with Workstream has been to change these norms by empowering the deskless economy with modern, innovative technology that makes it easier to hire and be hired. Thank you for supporting us on this journey. We can‚Äôt wait to show you what we have in store next!

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Company news 07/25/22 Improve applicant quality and hire hourly workers faster Share this article There‚Äôs no such thing as too many applicants, especially if you‚Äôre hiring hourly workers in an industry with high turnover. But due to the current economic climate, many businesses are seeing an influx of applicants‚Äîand leaders don‚Äôt have time to sift through each one to find the best. Using applicant tracking systems (ATS) that build automation into the hiring process can help you manage your large applicant pool and surface qualified candidates with less effort. Here are some automation tools and features you should be using to ensure the best applicants in your pool don‚Äôt slip through the cracks. Screening questions One of the best advantages of an ATS is the ability to filter out unqualified candidates with screening questions. By setting up mandatory screening questions ( we call them smart screening questions at Workstream ) in the digital application process, you can automatically reject candidates that don‚Äôt fit your open role‚Äôs criteria. Applicants that pass the smart screening stage are automatically pushed to the next phase of the hiring process‚Äîtypically a prompt for applicants to self-schedule an interview based on your hiring manager‚Äôs availability. Not only does this save tremendous time, but it also provides applicants with a better experience than they would have if someone were reviewing each application manually and ghosting unqualified applicants. Think of the qualifications for your open position and make sure your screening questions reflect them. For example: If you need to fill shifts at a specific time, did you ask about availability? Is there an age requirement for the position? Do applicants need a driver‚Äôs license? Did you ask about work eligibility? Customizable hiring workflows Every business, role, and hiring manager is different so the last thing you want is an ATS you can‚Äôt customize. And with applicant flow higher than normal right now, your applicant pool might still be unmanageable even with thorough screening questions in place. If you find yourself in that position, you can edit the hiring process within most ATS systems to include another, more manual, stage of review. Although this does impact the faster hiring workflow that the automation we discussed previously enables, it allows those that want to be a bit more hands-on to review their pre-screened applicant pool and manually push forward qualified applicants to the self-schedule stage. You may also want the ability to adjust the interview length. While adding review stages can make your hiring process a bit longer, the flexibility to shorten interviews can bring you closer to your ideal hire faster. The top reason why you‚Äôd want to shorten your interviews is that your screening questions already did all the work for you. With strong screening questions like we discussed above, your in-person interview can instead serve to validate an applicant has the skills they say they do and allow you both to explore if this is a good culture fit. We‚Äôve seen businesses shorten interviews to 15 minutes and still make successful hires! Evaluation plans The best way to ensure you‚Äôre evaluating applicants objectively and making unbiased hiring decisions is to include an interview panel and establish a set of candidate criteria ahead of time . In doing so, you‚Äôre ensuring you‚Äôre assessing people against the same benchmarks and including different perspectives in the evaluation process. While adding more inputs is a great way to ensure you‚Äôre being thoughtful in your hiring, it also can make collecting feedback messy. Instead of hallway conversations or quick calls, encourage your hiring team to input their feedback into your ATS and evaluate each candidate against your preset criteria. This makes it easy to compare all top candidates at a glance and see all feedback. If your ATS has a mobile app, even better. This makes it easier for your panel to quickly submit their feedback after the interview while it‚Äôs fresh in their minds, instead of hours later when they‚Äôve made their way back to their computers. Reapplication controls Sometimes the same person will apply for multiple open roles within an organization and keep applying whenever they see a new job posting pop up. This person might keep trying despite rejections. To avoid having repeat applications that don‚Äôt fit your role‚Äôs qualifications, some ATS systems will allow you to block unfavorable candidates from applying to open roles. Similarly, you can set up waiting times in between applications from the same person so individuals can‚Äôt spam apply to all your multiple roles and clog up your applicant pool. Don‚Äôt waste time on unqualified applicants While too many applicants is a far better problem to have than too few, the influx does create a new problem for busy hiring managers. The right tools can help you sift through your overflowing applicant pools and uncover the best people for your open roles, without taking up all your time.

That‚Äôs what we set out to do when we launched Workstream with our two-way texting and automation technology. But the experience shouldn‚Äôt stop once a candidate accepts your offer. We‚Äôre excited to announce Workstream Onboarding , an extension of our product suite that makes onboarding new hires a quick and easy experience for both employees and employers. Onboarding up until now has been a tedious, manual process that often results in errors. (In fact, 60-80% of paper I-9s are missing or incomplete, which can result in fines.) The pressure to fill out so much paperwork in those early days of a new job can cause employees to make mistakes or miss critical information. Workstream Onboarding brings the digital-first experience of our Hiring product to your onboarding flow so both you and your employees can zoom through the paperwork with accuracy and ease. With onboarding time cut down from hours to minutes, you can now focus those early interactions on the things that increase engagement and reduce turnover: building trust and a sense of community with your new hire. Improving the onboarding experience for all Easy to use: Onboarding is easy to customize so you can make the workflow unique to your business, the position, and the new hire. For instance, some roles might require extra paperwork like a vehicle use agreement or phone policy. Once you‚Äôre ready, automatic alerts will prompt new hires to start completing their digital paperwork on their own. Digital-first: Ditch the physical paperwork and move your entire onboarding process to our platform. With out-of-the-box templates, custom forms, electronic signatures, and digital document storage, you can get new hires up and running faster than ever before. Employee-friendly: You‚Äôve worked hard to build rapport with your new hire. Continue building that relationship with open communication and a stress-free onboarding experience that takes less than 10 minutes to complete. Start new hires off on the right foot Onboarding can be stressful for both employees and managers. With Onboarding, you can give new team members an easy, digital way to get set up and start learning about their new job‚Äîwhile saving you time on the tedious aspects of the process. We hope this evolution of our product suite makes managing how you hire and onboard even easier.

This is a major milestone for the company‚Äîand the deskless workforce. In July 2021, we helped local businesses fill more than 18,700 jobs, which represents more than 2.5% of all private jobs added in America.

Because current economic conditions continue to make it difficult for you to staff up and for hourly workers to find jobs, we published an exclusive book‚ÄîThe Practical Guide To Hiring Hourly Employees‚Äîthat we‚Äôd like to send you to thank you for your support. Having spoken to thousands of local businesses since our founding in late 2017‚Äîfrom the owners of a local cafe like Coupa Cafe to the franchisees of Jamba‚ÄîI am humbled by your relentless drive to build and create, and your contribution to our local communities. Local businesses are the bedrock of America, and create approximately two-thirds of net-new jobs in the United States. There are more than 5 million small businesses and more than 100 million workers in the United States who work for the companies you lead. The role you play in our economy is incredible. Local businesses, unfortunately, have fallen behind in terms of the tools they have to recruit, onboard, manage and engage their hourly employees‚Äîespecially in the mobile-first world where hourly workers have moved away from email and paper applications to using text as a main mode of communication. As a former restaurant owner, I saw the challenges of hiring, managing and engaging hourly workers and the lack of tools and technology to run my business. I also saw the technology gap for deskless workers when I was a kid, sitting next to my dad (also an hourly worker) in his van and helping him deliver food each morning. Over the past 20 years, a lot of software and tools have been built for the office and technology worker. There has been, however, a huge lack of modern software to help local businesses. So, we started Workstream. We set out to solve this by providing local businesses the technology they need to hire and manage the best talent, grow faster and stay competitive. Each milestone we‚Äôve reached as a company has been possible because of our amazing customers, partners, investors and team members‚Äîand this one is no different.

At Workstream, we strive to build a team of passionate and humble individuals. Today, we turn the spotlight on our Account Development Lead, Alyssa Villarreal . Alyssa graduated from college with a double degree in Marketing and Business Administration. Coming out of high school, she was interested in advertising and figured she had end up at an ad firm or do something in marketing. Halfway through college, she was introduced to the sales program there and fell in love with sales and found that she had a knack for it! Being on the Account Development team, she spends most of her time finding franchisee‚Äôs or small business owners who are experiencing hiring challenges. Then, she connects with them and share how Workstream alleviates these problems. She shares that \"it‚Äôs really rewarding to see how our software can save people time, money, and headaches when it comes to hiring!\" When did you join Workstream, and what made you choose Workstream over other companies? Alyssa: A close mentor of mine had shared several different companies that were hiring. When he mentioned Workstream, I‚Äôd never heard of it but the software intrigued me. It was something that sounded simple but could have a strong impact. I felt that having¬†the small background as a deskless worker I did, it would help me to better relate to the software and make it easier for me to learn. Then, when I was connected with Blake and Desmond, I was sold. They‚Äôre incredible leaders and shared their vision for the company and it excited me. Blake has built an amazing sales team and Desmond has created an incredible company and culture that I am so lucky to be a part of! As a Hiring Specialist in Workstream, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve spoke with many hiring managers. What‚Äôs the number one challenge in hiring that you‚Äôve seen? Alyssa: A common challenge I hear is that the job market is extremely competitive - especially amongst delivery drivers. Recently, I was on a call with some owners who has a couple stores in close proximity of each other. They were saying that even their own stores are competing with each other to get the applicants , along with several other QSR concepts nearby! With other companies offering delivery driver roles, like UberEats, DoorDash, and local delivery groups, it can be hard to source applicants for this type of role or get back to the applicant in a timely manner to secure an interview with them. Speed and continuous engagement are huge in this industry. Responding to a candidate just a few hours after they apply can be too late to catch them. With Workstream , communication can be automated so hiring managers don‚Äôt have to worry about getting to an applicant an hour late. Are there any up and rising trends in hiring that you have noticed? Alyssa: Utilizing cellphones in the hiring process . In the time we live in, almost everything can be done by mobile phone - depositing checks to the bank, watching movies, sometimes even locking your front door! Digitizing the hiring process and enabling applicants/mangers to use their phone is a trend many places are moving towards and moving away from paper processes. What professional accomplishments are you most proud of since you joined Workstream? Alyssa: Becoming the top ADR for the month and getting promoted to lead the ADR team. It‚Äôs nice to know my efforts are seen and valued by my teammates and leadership! Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Alyssa: All through high school and a majority of college I was an hourly worker. When I was in high school, I worked as a sales associate in retail and also in parks and recreation. When I got to college, I needed to find a flexible job because I was playing lacrosse for the school and my schedule was packed. I ended up getting an hourly job at a call center. Essentially, I was an off-site leasing agent for apartment communities across the country, helping people to find apartments. It was great experience and I honed my communication skills which continues to help me in my role today. What is something you learned that you practice daily? Alyssa: Always celebrate the wins. I learned this while playing collegiate lacrosse. After every goal scored it was important to ‚Äòcelly‚Äô (similar to what football players do after they score a touchdown) afterwards. It‚Äôs a great way to get hyped up and keep energy high. I try to practice this daily and the sales team at Workstream helps me to remember too. Everyone is constantly building each other up and creating positive vibes in the office. What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Alyssa: Balancing work and home life. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve found the perfect solution to this challenge (certainly open to suggestions!), but I have some ways that help me to separate work and home. For me, when my work day is over I try and ‚Äòunplug‚Äô and not look at screens (tv, computer, phone). Reading has helped a lot with this. It‚Äôs easy to bring work home with you (don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm definitely guilty of this), but I think it is important to balance these parts of life to reduce the chance of burnout! Who inspires you and why? Alyssa: Different people inspire me for different things. When I think of business, I look up to Yvon Chouinard, founder and CEO of Patagonia. He‚Äôs built an incredible company simply by doing what he loves. He first started by making rock climbing gear to use personally on climbing trips and that‚Äôs how Patagonia was born! I‚Äôve always been impressed that Yvon has woven sustainability and environmentalism in his company which is pretty amazing because the textile industry isn‚Äôt the best for the environment. He is not the typical businessman ‚Äî he‚Äôs is unique in his leadership and inspires me to not be afraid to think outside of the box! What quote / mantra inspires you? Alyssa: There‚Äôs many quotes I‚Äôm fond of, but one that has always inspired me is ‚ÄòDo what you love, love what you do‚Äô. Life is too short to spend time doing things that don‚Äôt make you happy!

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 06/17/24 How to create a great restaurant onboarding experience Share this article Hiring is a big part of the restaurant industry . Especially when you factor in the fact that only 54 percent of quick-service employees reached 90 days of work before quitting their jobs. Compared to the 47.2 percent average annual turnover rate for all industries in the U.S., restaurant owners and managers are faced with a constant challenge to recruit, hire, and retain their best workers. This is why getting the restaurant onboarding experience right is so important for your QSR. When it‚Äôs done correctly, new employees become familiar with your workplace and are able to perform their jobs with confidence‚Äîhelping them succeed, belong, and feel more engaged at work. It also sets your QSR apart from the ones who rush through or skip over the process altogether. In our step-by-step guide, we‚Äôll help you and your new hires get on the faster path to productivity using our restaurant onboarding checklist . It will not only help you rethink your current approach to restaurant orientation but also make new employees glad they chose the job and joined the team. Many of these steps can be completed during a new hire ‚Äôs first day of employment. Some of the other parts of the process will continue throughout the week. Restaurant onboarding starts with: ‚Äã‚ÄãPaperwork and documentation Before an applicant or new hire becomes an employee, they need to complete their onboarding documentation. As a hiring manager or owner, it‚Äôs your responsibility to make sure this happens. Let all your new hires know to bring a photo I.D., Social Security number, and bank information. Get the necessary new-hire paperwork together, such as employment contracts, tax forms, and employee handbooks . Then, to streamline the process, include a checklist with those documents outlining all the tasks that need to be completed. The most important pieces of documentation to complete are the W-4 (so each employee‚Äôs taxes are withheld) and I-9 (to show they‚Äôre legally allowed to work in the U.S.) Items on your restaurant onboarding checklist to confirm, collect, or distribute should include: Photo I.D. Social Security number W-4 Form Direct deposit form Blank check or ACH bank information from the employee Health insurance or benefits forms (as applicable) Employment agreements or job contracts Safety and/or compliance forms Emergency contact information Restaurant employee handbook (if available) Keep these documents on file for every employee, either on paper or electronically. If your QSR doesn‚Äôt have handbooks available, make time to go over your restaurant‚Äôs policies or rules with new hires during introductions‚Äîespecially dress code , attendance, and conduct expectations. Welcome and introduction Whether you‚Äôre a new hire starting your first job or an experienced veteran trying out a different restaurant, the first day of work can be both exciting and stressful. This is why it‚Äôs important to warmly greet employees the moment they arrive and introduce them to their team. This is also the ideal opportunity for you to give your new staff an overview of your restaurant‚Äôs mission, values, and work culture. Every QSR is different, so your restaurant orientation is where you‚Äôll answer any questions about your company‚Äôs rules and requirements. Sharing a brief history of your QSR, its brand, and ways of doing things is a fun and informative part of any restaurant onboarding. And it‚Äôs always important to review your scheduling policy as soon as possible‚Äîlike how to take breaks, cover shifts, request time off, and handle sick days. If your QSR uses an app or online schedules instead of printed ones, include this in your training and when setting up new hires with logins to your POS, payroll, security, or other staff systems. Training and orientation The training and orientation step is often the highlight of any restaurant onboarding for a new hire . It provides everyone with a chance to familiarize themselves with all the key areas that comprise your restaurant‚Äôs layout‚Äîfrom the kitchen and dining room to the storage area and restrooms. The restaurant orientation is when both front-of-house (FOH) and back-of-house (BOH) workers enjoy menu tastings to get a better feel for your restaurant. It also includes pairing suggestions and upsell ideas for servers and the memorization of ingredients and allergens for your kitchen staff. After the tour, plan on conducting initial training for your new hires on the essential tasks and job responsibilities of their roles‚Äîsuch as food handling procedures, safety protocols, and customer service standards. If anyone needs their food handler‚Äôs permit, ensure they get the right training . Equipment familiarization Getting your new hires up to speed with a fast-paced kitchen and ready to satisfy the needs and expectations of existing customers will involve introducing them to any equipment or technology they‚Äôll use throughout their shifts‚Äîincluding POS systems , kitchen appliances, or cleaning tools. Besides improving your staff‚Äôs speed and efficiency, providing employees with hands-on training and guidance on operating your equipment correctly can help prevent the most common accidents. As a general kitchen rule, all machines should only be operated according to the manufacturer‚Äôs guidelines with the guards provided. Equipment should be turned off and unplugged for cleaning purposes. Keep appliances from wet areas and inspect cords to help prevent electrical hazards. Shadowing and mentoring During your restaurant orientation, try pairing your new hires with a mentor or buddy. These are typically the most experienced workers on your staff‚Äîthe team members best equipped to provide the hands-on support they need throughout the onboarding process . By encouraging these ongoing shadowing opportunities, trainees will be able to see someone in action‚Äîexpertly performing the role they were hired for and imparting best practices as they go. Trainees may also feel more comfortable going to buddies with questions rather than restaurant managers . Job shadowing and mentoring throughout is also an effective way to help new hires understand your company‚Äôs culture , correct bad habits or ineffective practices from past roles, and grow into their position more quickly. Even gaining a greater appreciation for the job and their fellow restaurant staff . Customer service training Training your new hires in the nuances of customer service is critical for creating a more positive experience for your customers. It‚Äôs important for you to role play common customer interactions with your staff to practice the practical communication or interaction skills they‚Äôll use day to day. Whether they‚Äôre working front of house or back of house , your restaurant employees should be trained in all the basics of greeting guests, maintaining a clean workspace, and demonstrating professionalism at all times. As mentioned before, training should address a working knowledge of your menu so employees can make recommendations and answer any customer questions. By providing comprehensive customer service training to your new hires during your onboarding program , your staff will be better equipped to provide a superior dining experience for guests. This will lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, as well as greater employee confidence. Feedback and evaluation It‚Äôs critical to initiate regular feedback and evaluations with your new hires . This is how you beat the 90-day turnover curse and increase retention early on. An effective way is to schedule routine one-on-one meetings and send new hire surveys to discuss performance, address any concerns, and provide constructive feedback as needed. By setting clear performance goals and job expectations from the start, you supply your trainees with the support and confidence it takes for continual skills development as they grow into their specific roles. Sharing guided, actionable feedback also helps new hires know where they excel and which areas require improvement. Schedule these check-ins throughout their first 90 days. Check-ins , evaluations, feedback sessions, and one-on-one meetings not only benefit new hires during the restaurant onboarding. They‚Äôre also invaluable opportunities for you and your staff to evaluate the overall effectiveness of your training regimen and to make necessary adjustments. Integration and team building Building, maintaining, and retaining a winning team of restaurant employees involves a lot more than employee training , menu memorization, and knowledge about your brand. Staff members must be able to form interpersonal bonds and feel motivated to work together, whatever the situation. By encouraging team bonding activities and social interactions between new hires and existing workers, trainees feel immediately welcome and integrated into the team. It begins by fostering a positive work culture that values collaboration, communication, and mutual support above all. Many of these activities can be hosted on location right at your restaurant‚Äîeither after hours at night, in the morning before opening, or on a day your business is closed. For example, pair up new hires and experienced employees on a scavenger hunt as a fun way to familiarize trainees with the restaurant‚Äôs layout. Try games like 2 Truths and a Lie to share facts about each other. Going out to see a movie together, forming a league softball team, or organizing a charity event are also great team-building activities. The important thing is for everyone to stay motivated and feel like they have each other‚Äôs back‚Äîall of which reduces employee turnover and increases productivity. Follow up and support Even the most successful team members among your new hires will require a follow up after the initial employee onboarding process . This is your chance to ensure that your trainees are adjusting well and any remaining questions or concerns they have after their restaurant orientation are addressed. Plan to offer your continued support and make resources available to help employees succeed in their roles and contribute to your QSR‚Äôs bottom line. When the newest members of your FOH staff are happy, confident, and well-trained, the customer service and guest experience at your restaurant improves. When your BOH team works well together and knows how to maintain the quality and consistency of the menu, customers can always expect a timely and satisfying meal. Get the restaurant onboarding experience right for your new hires and everything falls in place.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 03/18/24 Engage hourly workers with a strong communication strategy Share this article Successful organizations realize the importance of effective internal communication strategies to engage their hourly employees. These employees interact directly with customers and represent the face of the company, so they play a crucial role in shaping the customer experience and driving business success. However, engaging hourly employees can be challenging, especially when they‚Äôre spread across multiple locations or different shifts. What are internal communications? Internal employee communications are the methods and practices an organization uses to facilitate the exchange of information, ideas, and messages among its employees. They encompass various communication channels, such as written or oral communication, digital platforms , and team meetings, to ensure that employees are informed, connected, and engaged with the organization's goals and activities. Why are internal employee communications important? Internal communications are important for several reasons. They are vital in fostering a positive work culture , enhancing collaboration, and driving organizational success. Alignment and clarity Effective internal communication helps employees understand the organization's mission, vision, values, and strategic objectives. It ensures that everyone is on the same page and working towards common goals. Clear communication also reduces ambiguity, confusion, and misunderstandings. Employee engagement Open and transparent communication fosters a sense of belonging, trust, and involvement among employees. When employees feel informed and connected, they‚Äôre more likely to be engaged and motivated. Collaboration and teamwork Internal communication facilitates collaboration among employees. It enables the sharing of knowledge, best practices, and ideas, leading to improved teamwork, problem-solving, and decision-making. Employee satisfaction and retention When employees feel heard, valued, and informed, they‚Äôre more satisfied with their work environment. In 2023, 85 percent of businesses considered higher employee satisfaction their main priority for internal communications. Open communication channels provide opportunities for feedback, recognition, and two-way dialogue, which contribute to higher job satisfaction. In turn, satisfied employees are more likely to stay with the organization, reducing turnover costs. Image source Customer experience Engaged and well-informed employees are better equipped to deliver excellent customer service. Internal communication informs employees about changes in products, services, policies, and customer needs. It empowers them with the knowledge and tools to provide quality service, leading to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty. 5 ways to improve employee communication Even if you understand why internal communication is important for your organization, you might not know how to improve the processes that enable effective communication. Here are some tips to ensure that your business‚Äôs internal communication processes are as effective and efficient as possible. 1. Make messages easy to access Hourly workers don‚Äôt spend hours in front of their computers checking email. To ensure your announcements are seen by your staff, communicate with them in their preferred style: mobile.¬† Use messaging apps or text messages to ensure that important information reaches everyone instantly. 2. Be consistent Ensure consistency in messaging across all communication channels to prevent confusion or misinformation. Whether through emails, meetings, posters, or digital displays, maintaining a unified message helps reinforce key points and ensures alignment among your workers. 3. Encourage employee participation and feedback Foster a culture of two-way communication where your hourly workers are encouraged to share their thoughts, concerns, and ideas . Use tools like surveys, suggestion boxes, or dedicated feedback sessions to gather insights from employees. Actively listening to and acting upon their feedback shows them that their opinions are valued and can lead to increased engagement. 4. Use video Incorporate video messages from senior leaders or training videos to deliver important information in an engaging and relatable manner. Videos can be particularly effective for hourly employees who may have limited time to engage with lengthy written communications. Visual content can help convey messages more effectively and foster a sense of connection with the organization. 5. Recognize and appreciate hourly employees Acknowledge the hard work and dedication of hourly workers through personalized recognition programs , public shout-outs, or employee spotlights. Celebrate milestones, achievements, and daily contributions to show appreciation for their efforts. Recognizing hourly employees not only boosts morale but also strengthens their connection with the organization, leading to improved loyalty and performance. Build employee engagement with effective internal communication Ultimately, effective internal communication plays a crucial role in engaging hourly employees and fostering a strong connection between them and the organization. By ensuring that messaging is clear, simple, and easily accessible, hourly workers can stay informed and aligned with the company's goals. Consistent messaging across various communication channels helps avoid confusion and reinforce key messages. Encouraging employee participation and feedback creates a culture of open dialogue and shows hourly employees that their opinions are valued. Utilizing videos as a communication tool increases engagement and delivers information in a relatable and engaging manner. Lastly, recognizing and appreciating hourly employees for their hard work and contributions boosts morale and strengthens their connection to the organization. By implementing these strategies into your internal communications, organizations can create an environment where hourly employees feel valued, engaged, and motivated to deliver exceptional performance.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 02/16/24 Workload management: The secret to retaining QSR employees Share this article Employee retention in the fast-food industry has always been a challenge. Many blame the high turnover rates on low wages or a lack of advancement opportunities. But the number one reason hourly workers quit is workload, a finding revealed in a survey of over 900 hourly workers conducted by Kathy Gosser, Ph.D. , University of Louisville professor of franchise management with 35+ years of experience working for KFC. ( Check out our conversation with her here ). Whether you‚Äôre a restaurant manager or a franchise owner, there are several things you can do now to reduce turnover rates, streamline operations, and improve service at your business. And with only 54% of QSR employees reaching the 90-day mark at a job before quitting, the sooner you can solve your workload problems, the better. The culprit behind overworked employees Scheduling challenges Anyone who has ever managed hourly employees knows that scheduling conflicts come with the territory. ¬†In addition to an industry-wide ¬†labor shortage, the inability to keep restaurants properly staffed is often a combination of schedule conflicts and poor planning. Sometimes, the problem is booking an employee for a shift on a day that they‚Äôre unavailable or already requested to take off. Other times, scheduling challenges arise because workers suddenly become sick, encounter transportation problems, or experience family emergencies. Some employers purposely assign fewer people to a shift than needed simply as a cost-cutting measure. It‚Äôs a short-term approach that can adversely affect a restaurant‚Äôs long-term retention prospects‚Äîas it can frustrate your staff by forcing them to pick up the slack. A proven and effective way to overcome (or circumvent) these workload management issues is using an automated scheduler. Powered by AI, these tools optimize your existing staff rosters by removing guesswork and human error while respecting the work-life balance of your workers. A good automated scheduler can even track time or handle time-off requests for your employees. No-show employees Sometimes people don't show up for work. And in the worst cases, they don't give you any heads up. This leaves your restaurant unexpectedly short staffed, creating stress and additional work for those that are there. And on top of that, your employees are still human and can only do so much. Wait times will probably be longer. Your customers probably won't be all that happy. As a manager, you're now on damage control. How do you find someone to cover the shift at the last minute? How do you reprimand someone for a no show? What do you say so the rest of your staff knows this type of behavior is unacceptable? And how do you give them the pep talk they need to preform under pressure? When it comes to dealing with no-show employees, it's important to figure out why they're not showing up and not giving warning. Is it due to burnout? Or apathy? Or have you made it too hard for employees to request off? Maybe your employees need extra flexibility or input into how their schedules are assigned. Help your hourly workforce by providing more options about when they work and opportunities to share their preferred shift times. Exercising good workload management is key. By mastering the art of scheduling, you can help your restaurant better rebound from the occasional no-show. In turn, it can also help you build a greater sense of trust and camaraderie among your team members since they'll know their coworkers won't leave them hanging. All of which results in better work environments, happier employees, and greater retention rates. The importance of employee engagement Engaged employees feel supported, valued, and appreciated at work. They tend to enjoy better relationships with their coworkers and managers and build stronger connections with their work. It‚Äôs this added sense of purpose and belonging that often results in greater employee retention. Creating a positive work culture‚Äîby recognizing and rewarding employee achievements or providing opportunities for growth and development‚Äîis a great way to encourage engagement, motivate your workforce, increase efficiency, and lower costs. According to a recent study , companies that make employee recognition a priority have workers who are 56% less likely to be looking for a new job. It can be as simple as consistent praise and gratitude or a more formal system to give employees awards or gift cards to show appreciation. Increased employee engagement in the workplace can also be inspired by work relationships. Gallup data suggests that simply having a best friend at work is strongly linked to increases in retention‚Äîalong with improvements in profitability, safety, and inventory control. An employee with a best friend at work is also more likely to interact with customers and do more in less time. Tips for improving employee retention Here‚Äôs a few more actionable ways to address your QSR‚Äôs workload-related issues, including strategies for scheduling your employees, creating a positive work environment and fostering engagement: Evaluate individual workloads: Use your knowledge of your staff‚Äôs capabilities to ensure each shift has enough hourly workers with the right skills to effectively allocate job tasks. Cross train your workforce: By expanding their skill sets, you can ensure that employees aren‚Äôt underutilized, improve overall workload distribution, and even increase job satisfaction. Ask for employee feedback: Have regular discussions with your workers to gain insights into workload struggles, feelings of burnout, and other issues so you can address them. Whenever possible, acknowledge employees who find opportunities to increase efficiency and tackle tasks more effectively. Recognition isn‚Äôt just motivation, but sets an example for the team. Create a work culture where everyone gets a break Prioritizing workload management is a critical element of any restaurant manager‚Äôs employee retention strategy. It starts with becoming more effective and strategic with how you schedule your hourly workforce and handle issues like no shows. Ultimately, it‚Äôs about making hourly workers feel engaged and valued for what they do each day to make your restaurant successful. By building a positive culture and giving your employees a voice, you can improve retention and gain a reputation as a great place to work in the process.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 02/05/24 Hiring Hacks: The dos and don'ts of workplace flexibility Share this article In today's workforce, hourly employees are just as eager for flexibility as any other worker. However, managers often find it challenging to incorporate flexibility into rigid hourly schedules. To assist employers in achieving the right balance and successful implementation, here are some valuable tips on workplace flexibility. DO: Invest in shift scheduling tools To effectively manage flexible schedules, employers need the assistance of advanced shift scheduling software. The old-fashioned manual approach is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, causing frustration for both employees and managers. By embracing modern tools, employers can streamline the scheduling process, saving precious time and alleviating administrative burdens. Mobile-optimized scheduling tools enable employees to request time off or swap shifts conveniently from their smartphones, improving accessibility and responsiveness . Not only does this enhance employee satisfaction, but it also reduces last-minute requests and helps maintain a stable and efficient workflow. DON'T: Treat schedules like one-size-fits-all While it may seem convenient to standardize shifts into clean 8-hour blocks, the eight hour work day doesn't work for everyone. If your employees are in school or have children, they may prefer having short shifts more often. ¬†To address these individual needs, consider offering flexible shift options , like shorter work days or split shifts, which can enable employees to better balance their personal and professional lives. A more personalized approach to scheduling shows employees that their well-being and work-life balance are valued, leading to increased loyalty and productivity. DO: Create a detailed shift swapping policy To tackle the occasional scheduling conflicts that come with flexibility, it's important to create a clear and comprehensive shift swapping policy. By engaging the team in the policy's development, employers can ensure that it meets the needs of employees while also aligning with business requirements. An accessible and easy-to-understand policy will empower employees to manage their own shift swaps responsibly, reducing managerial involvement and improving efficiency. Encouraging proactive communication between employees when arranging swaps fosters a collaborative work environment and builds stronger team dynamics. DON'T: Forget to call out flexibility in your hiring efforts Workplace flexibility is a game-changer when it comes to attracting the best hires and building a reputable employer brand. By highlighting your flexible work arrangements in your job descriptions , potential applicants are given a clear signal that work-life balance and employee well-being are highly valued by the employer. DO: Provide training and support for managers Flexibility is a hard nut to crack for managers of the hourly workforce. So help yours figure it out. By providing your managers with proper training on how to build flexible schedules, set clear expectations, and maintain open communication, you'll make it easier for them to better support their teams. They will be equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to navigate the challenges that come with managing flexible schedules in an hourly workforce. By supporting your managers in this way, you will build a culture that values and embraces flexibility, leading to higher employee satisfaction, productivity, and retention rates. DON'T: Overlook fairness and equity When it comes to embracing flexibility, it's important to maintain a fair and equal work environment. Avoid granting flexibility based on personal preferences or favoritism, as this can lead to disengagement and conflicts among employees. Instead, establish clear guidelines and criteria for offering flexible arrangements, ensuring that decisions are aligned with business needs and take into account individual circumstances. Transparent communication about the reasons behind granting or denying specific requests can foster understanding and prevent potential morale issues. Based on a survey by HBR, perceptions of a more fair employee experience improves employee performance by up to 26% and employee retention by up to 27%. A commitment to fairness and equity reinforces employees' trust in the organization and strengthens their commitment to its goals. DO: Monitor and evaluate policies Regularly assess the impact of flexible arrangements on productivity, employee satisfaction, and overall business outcomes. Collect feedback from employees through surveys or focus groups to gain insights into their experiences with workplace flexibility. Use this information to make data-driven decisions, identify areas for improvement, and refine policies to better meet employee needs. A culture of continuous improvement fosters an adaptable and supportive work environment, ultimately leading to a more engaged and motivated workforce. Workplace flexibility is a powerful tool By investing in scheduling technology, emphasizing flexibility in recruitment efforts, and continuously evaluating policies, companies can successfully integrate flexibility into their work culture. When approached strategically and with sensitivity to employee needs, workplace flexibility can be a driving force behind a happier, more engaged, and highly productive workforce.

A business plan helps people see the vision of the restaurant and makes sure people are aligned. What gets missed when business plans are created are proper goals. And not just any goals, but SMART goals . Now, we know that goal setting acronym won‚Äôt be new to everyone. So, in this article, we won‚Äôt just be showing you how to create SMART goals for restaurants. We‚Äôll also be sharing: How the SMART goal methodology helps restaurant managers and owners 4 tips to create and actually achieve your SMART goals for restaurants Examples of good SMART goals for a restaurant preparing for 2024 But, first, let‚Äôs start with the question you need to know the answer to for any of that to make sense! What Are SMART Goals for Restaurants? SMART is an acronym that stands for S pecific, M easurable , A ttainable , R elevant, and T imely. Let‚Äôs look at each component in detail as we build out an example of an excellent SMART goal for restaurants! Specific Vague goals are uninspiring. So, you need to make sure your restaurant business goal includes the specific outcome you hope to see. For example, instead of writing ‚Äúwe are going to increase revenue,‚Äù which is broad and general, consider ‚Äúwe are going to increase monthly revenue.‚Äù By adding ‚Äúmonthly,‚Äù you know exactly where you‚Äôll be focusing your attention when going after this goal. But, as we‚Äôre sure you can imagine, that‚Äôs not enough. Your goal also needs to be‚Ä¶ Measurable Increasing monthly revenue sounds good. But what will determine that you‚Äôve achieved it? Is a $1 increase in revenue enough for you to feel accomplished? Probably not! A measurable metric will help. Going back to the example, you can make that goal measurable by changing it to ‚Äúwe are going to increase monthly revenue by 15%.‚Äù With that small addition, you‚Äôll be able to easily determine whether you‚Äôre achieving your goal or not. Of course, this goal is still not good if it‚Äôs not... Attainable Is increasing your monthly revenue by 15% a realistic goal for your restaurant? If not, you‚Äôll need to make some changes. Otherwise, you‚Äôre setting yourself and your staff up for failure. Not ideal! To make sure your goal is attainable , look into your past performance. For example, if your monthly revenue has been increasing at a steady rate of 10%, going after 15% is probably attainable with the right strategy. Going after a 50% increase...? Probably not. But even if it is attainable , is this goal relevant to what really matters for your restaurant? Relevant There‚Äôs no point in increasing your revenue by 15% if that goal isn‚Äôt relevant to the current needs of your business. You may have more important things to worry about. Some questions that can help you to determine the relevancy of your goals are: Is this the right time to focus on this goal? Is this applicable to the current socio-economic situation? Is this part of our long-term vision? If you answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù to those questions, then you should probably write that goal down for 2024. But don‚Äôt give yourself the whole year to achieve it. Avoid procrastination by making it... Timely The last thing you need to make this an excellent goal is a deadline. By when would you like to see that monthly revenue goal? If you set it too far ahead in the future, you remove the sense of urgency that pushes you to achieve it. But if you set it too soon, you may not give yourself enough time. For example, you can add timeliness to your goal by revising it to be, ‚Äúwe are going to increase monthly revenue by 15% by the end of the second quarter.‚Äù Setting a timely goal like that one will also help you to map the timeline and break the goal down into smaller, achievable milestones! How the SMART Goal Methodology Helps Restaurant Managers and Owners Why go through all those steps just to set restaurant goals for the new year? Well, as a restaurant manager or owner, using the SMART goal methodology can help you: Have a clear direction. It‚Äôs easier for you and your staff to focus on the right things throughout the year with goals that are relevant to your business strategy. Increase motivation among staff. Regularly achieving relevant goals can boost morale and encourage your employees to work harder to achieve the next milestones. Determine metrics to evaluate progress. Measurable goals make it easy to determine if you‚Äôre making progress and evaluate which employees are contributing to that progress. Support your business vision and mission. At the end of the year, you‚Äôll have a better idea of what did and didn‚Äôt work, making it easier to set even bigger goals for years to come. How to Set and Achieve SMART Restaurant Goals for 2023 Now that you have learned about this goal-setting methodology and how it can help your restaurant succeed in 2023, it‚Äôs time to create your own SMART goals ! You‚Äôll do that in step 1. And in steps 2-4, you‚Äôll take action to make sure you actually achieve them. #1 Write Down Your Goals and Make Them SMART Start by writing a rough list of your short term and long term goals . It‚Äôs okay if, initially, your goals are vague or uninspiring. You can use the SMART method to eventually create better goals. For example, a goal to ‚Äúrecruit more staff‚Äù might become ‚ÄúHire 10 additional staff members by the end of March 2024.‚Äù Or if you‚Äôre tasked with boosting your marketing strategy you could say ‚Äúhave marketing strategy up and running by end of month.‚Äù That goal is now specific and measurable as you aim to get 10 new employees. It‚Äôs also attainable with the right hiring strategy . Given the current labor shortage , it‚Äôs also likely to be a relevant goal. Lastly, it‚Äôs timely because you can determine whether you‚Äôve achieved the goal at the end of March. Go through this process for all of the goals you write down. Then, move on to step #2! #2 Share Your Restaurant Goals with Your Team After coming up with your SMART goals , share and discuss them with your team. After all, you‚Äôll need your team to get the tasks moving! So, it‚Äôs important to get their buy-in. In this process, team members might also have feedback that you may want to take into consideration. Document any changes to the goals and share them with everyone involved. This is also a great way to build a strong company culture ! #3 Create an Action Plan Once your goals are set, you need to plan the tasks that you and your employees need to do to achieve that goal. You can even run a brainstorming session with everyone to get their input. For example, someone might suggest that you start using recruiting software to improve the hiring process ! The plan should also cover the following questions: What specific tasks need to be done? Who will be responsible for the steps? When should those actions be completed? And guess what! You can even use the SMART methodology when assigning tasks for each point of your action plan. #4 Schedule Date to Follow Up and Review It‚Äôs not enough to have your SMART restaurant goals and action plan. It‚Äôs also important to track the progress. When the deadlines of each goal arrive, set aside some time to review what works and what doesn‚Äôt. This will help you find areas for improvement and know when it‚Äôs time to celebrate success. 2024 SMART Goals for Restaurants Examples If you‚Äôre still not sure of what type of goals to set for 2024, we‚Äôre here to help provide some inspiration! Here are five examples of SMART goals that cover different aspects of running a restaurant. Finances: ‚ÄúLower business costs by 8% before the end of March 2024.‚Äù Service quality: ‚ÄúDecrease wait time for take-out orders by 5% before summer.‚Äù Marketing: ‚ÄúImprove Google customer review rating by ¬Ω star by Easter.‚Äù Employee retention: ‚ÄúReduce turnover rate by 35% by end of the third quarter in 2024.‚Äù Hiring: ‚ÄúOnboard three new top-level employees with at least 3 years of experience by the end of February 2024.‚Äù Key Takeaways You can and should use SMART restaurant goals to help your restaurant thrive in 2024! These types of goals will help you set clear expectations for your staff, determine the metrics of success, increase team morale, and set even better goals in the future. As a reminder, SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable , Attainable , Relevant, and Timely. Once you‚Äôve created your SMART goals using the steps we‚Äôve shared in this article, make sure to also share them with your team for feedback, create action plans, and schedule times to review your progress. If you get stuck while creating your goals, use the examples we‚Äôve shared here for inspiration!

Being the largest private employer in the country, the retail giant is continuously taking steps to improve its operations . The company has always been known for its obsession with cutting costs and is always in search of ways to automate jobs to reduce labor costs. This can be seen in its attempt to introduce ‚Äú smart assistants ‚Äù so that their employees would have more time helping customers. Even though this initiative was scrapped after the pandemic occurred, it does not mean that the retail giant has stopped looking for ways to use automation in its stores. In fact, Walmart has been innovating and expanding its technological capabilities to improve its hourly workers‚Äô efficiency and quality of service. In this article, we will discuss the ways in which Walmart has changed the retail scene and how it has transformed the experience for its hourly workers. Increase in Technological Advancements Walmart is constantly investing in automating its business including installing more self-checkout equipment and increasing its investments in its grocery-delivery business. In addition, the company is also experimenting with robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual and augmented reality to improve quality and efficiency for shoppers and reduce labor overhead. Many companies like Amazon, Target, and those relying on data handlers have made the move to use AI to tackle these routine tasks, with a guarantee to reduce human error. More importantly, it can also help to enhance the quality of training their hourly workers receive. Associates‚Äô Training In 2018, Walmart incorporated the use of Virtual Reality (VR) into its employee training and development program to upgrade the training experience of its associates. With the use of VR, learning becomes more experiential which boosts employees‚Äô confidence and knowledge retention. The three areas in which Walmart is using VR are - new technology, soft skills such as empathy, and compliance. Before the new Pickup Tower units were installed in Walmart stores, the company utilized VR to train its employees in managing operations with the new units in place. One thing‚Äôs for sure, the training definitely helped to engage them and instill confidence, as they were allowed to make mistakes and learn from them, all while being in a safe environment. Business Operations When Walmart introduced the concept of shelf-scanning robots to help ensure stock availability and accurate placement and pricing of items, many were in awe at the utilization of such state-of-the-art technology. Fast forward almost two years later, the retail giant decided to withdraw these robots as they might be more of a hindrance in the customer‚Äôs point of view than anything else. And since more customers are buying online in the current pandemic, having the workers collecting orders and doing the same inventory checks is as effective as using the robots. It could be a cost-cutting measure, or an attempt to protect the brand‚Äôs image - we can only speculate. But Walmart‚Äôs technological innovations did not stop there. To increase their efficiency and make the job easier for their workers, Walmart established the Intelligent Retail Lab , or IRL for short, to explore the use of AI and how it can contribute to enhancing the store experience. In IRL, Walmart uses a combination of cameras and real-life analytics to automatically send associates notifications whenever a particular item has run out. This greatly saves time when it comes to stock replenishment, and most importantly, employees need not comb through the whole store just to ensure that the store‚Äôs stock is sufficient. And this is just one way Walmart is using AI to streamline its operations. The key takeaway here is this - technology can simplify repeated and mundane job tasks. This allows employees to focus more on customer interaction or even adding creative ideas to the displays, things that typically require an added human touch. Essential Changes Needless to say, integrating technology into operations will also inevitably add on more responsibilities to each employee. Now that most of the simpler tasks are automated, Walmart has also modified store jobs for hourly workers to take on more complex duties, one of which includes ensuring that the store meets visual standards. As the company equips its employees with more skills, this allows them to also support others who want to take some time off or just need more help during busy shifts. This added responsibility might raise some questions. For one, do these hourly associates get more pay? Will they have a higher chance of growing their career in the company? Absolutely! In 2021, Walmart announced that these hourly roles will receive a raise that will increase their average pay to above $15/hour. For team lead roles, the wage can go up to $30/hour. Hourly associates also have the opportunity to grow their career in Walmart should they possess the relevant skills needed. In fact, there are many cases in which entry-level associates climb up the ranks to eventually serve as store managers. Summing Up Technology has definitely allowed Walmart to transform the retail scene and bring out a better experience for its hourly workers. As these automations eliminate certain mundane tasks, they are able to focus on other responsibilities that require more compassion and creativity. With the improved conditions Walmart is setting up for its hourly workers, it‚Äôll be no surprise if the company builds a reputation for prioritizing employees‚Äô experience and satisfaction. Did you know that automation can be used in your recruitment process too? With the proliferation of technology, you can now streamline your hiring stages by utilizing smart screening or even automated scheduling .

It's not just fancy jargon thrown around a board room; it's a key aspect to consider whether you‚Äôre handling customer information, payment details, or health records, just to name a few. Whether you're a boss, a manager, or someone hiring hourly workers, you've got to know what compliance is and how compliance issues can have legal implications. So, in this guide, we‚Äôre going to discuss what compliance means, the importance of information security , the growing risk cybersecurity has on businesses, and the best way to handle sensitive information. What Is Compliance? The definition of compliance is like following the rules of a game but in the corporate world. It means doing things the right way, especially when it comes to legal regulations and data protection policies. Put simply, compliance means playing by the book and protecting both a business and its customers. Types of Compliance Whether you‚Äôre talking about GDPR or cybersecurity , compliance can cover a number of different areas of a business. Generally, a chief compliance officer will be responsible for ensuring a company is fully compliant so most members of staff, especially entry-level staff, won‚Äôt need to worry too much about changes in regulations and laws. But, depending on the industry you work in, you might need to be fully aware of your role to prevent any compliance issues from cropping up. So, let‚Äôs take a quick look at the different forms it can come in. 1. Regulatory Compliance : Regulatory compliance is corporate governance . It's typical in American workplaces, where there are many laws to ensure everything's fair and safe. It tends to involve the relationship between board members, management, and the rest of the company. Usually, a well-established company would have a dedicated compliance department to handle all compliance requirements and compliance issues should they arise. 2. Workplace Compliance: Workplace compliance focuses on equality among your team and ensures that everyone behaves in a professional and appropriate way. This type of compliance helps to create a positive workplace environment for all. 3. Environmental Compliance: Environmental compliance is about taking care of the planet. It's like being a good citizen and following the rules to protect nature. Think of a company that produces a harmful bi-product. They must follow strict rules on when, where, and how they remove waste. Why Is Compliance Important? While compliance helps prevent legal action, it also helps protect people and the environment. Here's why it's important: Legal Protection: Compliance keeps you out of hot water. It's like having a police officer around to make sure you don't break any corporate rules. If you don't follow compliance requirements , you could get in trouble with the law. For instance, discriminating against employees or forcing people to work in poor working conditions would be unethical and downright wrong. But sadly, some companies would attempt to do this, if left to their own devices. Compliance prevents this from happening. Reputation Management: Compliance makes you look good. It's like being known as the friend who always plays fair. When you follow compliance programs , people trust you more, and that's good for business. Think of a fast food company such as McDonalds . They have a reputation to uphold so they must ensure their business runs smoothly and doesn‚Äôt end up facing legal action should a franchise fail to operate legally. Employee Well-being: From work-related stress to sexual harassment, employee wellbeing compliance focuses on mental well-being and making sure employees are treated fairly at all times. For instance, Sandra applied for a job in a marketing firm in New York . She explains that she is single but has a child at home. The recruiter must not discriminate against her as a single parent but instead offer her the same opportunity as any other candidate as long as she understands the role and the requirements and, of course, meets the criteria for the job. If hired, she should not be treated any differently than any other employee. Risk Mitigation: As a business, minimizing risk is a must. And compliance helps you avoid unnecessary problems. It's like wearing a helmet when you ride a bike; it protects you from getting hurt. When you follow compliance efforts , you actively reduce the chances of something bad happening, such as a data security breach. For example, Becky is a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company. Becky handles client contact information and visits her clients often. Becky must not save client information and have client conversations with a personal mobile device. She must only use a company phone and a company computer. The risk of using personal devices is that sensitive client information could be leaked which could include health records and patient information. Competitive Advantage: Compliance can also help set you apart from others. It's like being the best player on the team. When you're known for following the rules and doing things right, people will want to work with you. This is because you won‚Äôt be considered a risk and will work legally at all times. Compliance FAQs: What is the means of compliance? The \"means of compliance\" are the methods or ways of following the rules. It's how you make sure you're doing things right as a company and avoiding any compliance issues . What is compliance in the workplace? In the workplace, compliance is all about following the rules your company sets. It means that your employees fully understand and appreciate that compliance efforts are mandatory, and non-compliance will lead to disciplinary action. What is an example of compliance? GDPR is a clear example of compliance regulation. It affects internet users based in the EU and grants them specific rights and control over when and how personal data is processed. For example, before GDPR , companies could collect personal data and share it with third parties without asking for permission from a user. Now, users have a say in how their information is collected, what is collected, and who it‚Äôs shared with or how it‚Äôs used. Assessments are carried out across the EU at random to ensure companies are GDPR compliant. What is a compliance synonym ? A synonym for compliance could be adherence or you could say a company that is regulated. Final Thoughts On Compliance Compliance is not something you do once and forget about. You can‚Äôt just tick a box and you‚Äôre done. It‚Äôs a big part of running a legal and fair company. It requires you to pay attention, be flexible, and always do the right thing. But to keep on top of changing regulations and laws, you can hire a chief compliance officer to handle the hard work for you and save yourself precious time as a business owner.

More are rethinking their marketing practices and realigning their employees to better increase sales and compete with their online counterparts. However, the redesign of stores and the improvement of online presence are only producing minimal results. Thus, many of the surviving retailers are turning to improve their customers' experiences as well. In most retail establishments, the majority of their employees are part-time workers whose schedules fluctuate frequently, giving employees only a few days' notice of when they are scheduled to work. This can be disruptive for those who require some flexibility, be it to arrange daycare, school classes, and other life necessities. As such, employee morale and engagement will decrease, affecting their ability to provide good customer service. Thankfully, the change to a more stable scheduling practice is on the rise. Since 2015, many cities such as San Francisco, New York, and Seattle have passed legislation requiring retailers to implement more stable schedules and to post them in advance. Additionally, 15 retailers have implemented a policy where employees' scheduled work shifts can no longer be canceled at the last minute, unless in the case of an emergency. One of the retailers leading the way in these changes is The Gap, Inc., or Gap for short, headquartered in San Francisco, CA. Creating Change The American clothing retailer knew that to improve their customer service, they would have to work on their employees‚Äô engagement. One of the first things Gap did to enhance this was to eliminate what is known as \"on-calls\", where employees are scheduled to work a shift that can be canceled at any time, even up to two hours before they begin their shift. This late notice will undoubtedly disrupt the quality of life for the employee, especially for those with children and for anyone counting on the job to provide them with their basic needs. The second thing Gap did was to ensure that their employees' schedules are posted two weeks in advance. Both of these steps were implemented in all of the company's approximately 2,500 stores. These changes, studied in a Harvard Business Review article , produced extraordinary results. It was found that sales in stores with more stable schedules increased by 7%. And this is in the retail industry that normally hovers around 2%! In addition, the productivity of Gap employees increased by 5%, twice as much as the industry average, which was recorded at 2.5% per year between 1987 and 2014. Additionally, a study conducted by the Wharton School of Management found that retail stores tend to be understaffed during peak hours. If they were to increase their number of staff, however, sales and profits would increase. And this was exactly what Gap did - they increased staffing appropriately based on traffic patterns while staying true to its stable scheduling practices. After conducting an initial 35-week experiment before rolling out to all of the company's stores, the Harvard study estimates that Gap earned $2.9 million thanks to their improved scheduling system. Gap's App Gap's employee app, Shift Messenger, is one of several available smartphone apps that allow workers to post a request for a shift swap with other employees. Through the app, employees are able to notify other Gap associates of shifts that conflict with their life schedules and allow them to switch shifts with others. This gives employees the chance to change their schedules when something unexpected crops up, while at the same time saving the managers the trouble of finding a replacement for them. The initial rollout found that 95% of part-time associates surveyed agreed that the app made it easier for them to arrange their work schedules around their daily life. Since Gap typically attracts younger workers, who are used to communicating on their phones, Shift Messenger is just another platform they can use to make their life easier (62% of them are utilizing the app). There was some concern in the Harvard Review study that workers of the age of 50 and above might not be receptive to using the app, but studies show that about 46% of those workers are actually using it. A platform for shift swapping is new to the retail industry and is evidently benefiting Gap. With the stability of schedules and the opportunity for hourly employees to get their shifts covered when needed, morale and engagement are improving for the retailer. This may also be why the company is attracting employees in the marketplace while other retailers are struggling to find hourly employees for their business. Bountiful Benefits Gap took a chance during a trying time for brick-and-mortar retailers and focused its efforts on improving its employee's scheduling system. As a result, this helped to cultivate a better work-life balance for all of the company's team members. The strategy was effective and created a two-fold benefit. Firstly, it is not a mystery that happy, content employees provide a better customer experience. Currently, Gap is the largest specialty retailer in the United States and ranked third in total international locations. Needless to say, much of the company's success can be attributed to engaged employees looking for better ways to improve their service. Secondly, the stable scheduling brought about by the Shift Messenger app improved company loyalty. Just as with the Hawthorne experiments in the early 1920s, employees notice when a company is paying attention to them and care about their well-being. Gap employees' loyalty allowed them to be more innovative which helps to improve the company's bottom line. One of the cases in point was when Gap employees realized that a lot of customers were leaving the store frustrated as 40% of the time, a product that a customer wanted wasn't on the shelf but in the stockroom. Thanks to the diligent employees observing this problem, another app, called \"In Stock on Shelf\" was created to generate real-time replenishment reports. And of course, this helped to improve the brand's customer service. By giving employees stability in their schedules and giving them more control over their shifts, Gap continues to increase sales and profits regularly, even breaking previous company records. Businesses managing hourly employees can perhaps take a page from Gap's innovative strategy to employee scheduling. Do you have a plan to improve your hourly employees‚Äô morale?

Share this article The North America economy as a whole is still very good. In both the US and Canada, people are enjoying the fruits of their labor and exploring new food products in the form of experimentations with various restaurants, new food delivery services, recipes found on home cooking programs, and more. This certification is recognition that food service professionals have undergone food handler training to get food safety knowledge in the best practices of food handling and serves to help prevent food-related health hazards. To provide for this increased demand, there are currently approximately over 18 million people employed preparing, cooking, and serving food and beverages to customers, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) and Statistics Canada . While many of the frequented establishments take pride in their safety measures, to ensure protection of the consumer, a food handling certification is required in many states in the US and Canada. This certification is recognition that food service professionals and food workers have been trained in the best practices of food handling and serves to help prevent food-related health hazards.¬† Upon successful completion of a food handling certification course, individuals are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to maintain food safety standards in the workplace. Purpose of the Food Handling Certification Food borne illnesses can be quite serious, resulting in hospitalization and even death. Unfortunately, food borne illnesses still occur today. The food handlers license targets professionals who are required to obtain it in their state to serve, store, or prepare food. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 48 million people get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die from food borne diseases each year in the United States. In Canada it is estimated that every year there are four million cases of food-borne illness , 11,600 hospitalizations, and 238 deaths, according to Health Canada . Having a standard in place, like the Food Handling Certification helps to reduce the number of food borne illnesses . According to the National Restaurant Association (NRA), \"The Food Handling Certification targets professionals who are required to obtain a food handler card in their state to serve, store or prepare food. The course covers five primary areas affecting food handlers: food safety , personal hygiene , time and temperature, cleaning and sanitation, and cross-contamination and allergens . Additionally, food service professionals learn about risk management ( food service industry and sanitation) issues, best practices for food safety , and the FDA Food Code.\" Who Requires the Certification? Not all areas in the US and Canada require certifications. To find out if your business does, in Canada, visit the Canadian Institute and search by location . In the US, go to ServSafe and look under Locations. By putting in your state, you can determine if it is a state requirement to obtain a certification or simply a Demonstration of Knowledge, or if there are county requirements for your business location. Although requirements vary by state and location, there are multiple benefits for having Food Handling certifications as well as many other certifications offered for the food industry.¬† Ensure your food safety training meets the necessary standards for your region. This certification is often regulated by the local health department to ensure compliance with food safety standards. How Do I Get Certified? In the US, it is the NRA's ServSafe that provides the training resources and certifications for food handlers. In Canada, it is the Canadian Institute for Food Safety . Both offer educational resources, materials and programs to help attract and develop a strong industry workforce. ServSafe has been the restaurant industry's leading association since 1919, and takes the education programs for certification very seriously with over 960,000 training locations. The Canadian Institute provides educational products and is a strong advocate for better food safety training programs in Canada. Certification process In addition, the National Registry of Food Safety Professionals ( NRFSP ), is a globally recognized organization that also provides food service industry examinations, standards and best practices such as the Food Safety First Principles for Food Handlers certification . This is a certification program accredited by ANSI against the ASTM standards for California , Arizona, Texas and Illinois, designed to ensure food handlers have the skills to handle, serve, prepare and display food. This program covers food safety , knowledge about contamination and cross-contamination , time and temperature controls , cleaning and sanitizing, and personal hygiene . In order to earn the certificate, candidates must not only complete the training course , but pass a all-encompassing exam. Finally, Learn2Serve offers a Food Handling Certification for anyone who handles unpackaged food or equipment, and surfaces or utensils that are exposed to unpackaged foods. After completing the required training modules and passing the examination, candidates will receive their certificate of completion , indicating that they have met the necessary requirements for food handler certification . Some of these courses and manager certifications are available online and only take a few hours to complete. For many of them, like ServSafe , you simply select the state where you would like to purchase and choose the Online Course . You will then need to create a User ID and Password, then enter it to access the course. All of the resources listed above offer a Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ ) section as well as a step-by-step guide to help the user through the process. Obviously, the goal is to learn proper food handling techniques and procedures, but the side benefit is earning a certification that is respected in the industry and extremely valuable for employment purposes. Certification Helps Business and the Industry The benefits of hiring food handling certified employees for your business should be obvious. Of course, the concern for the well-being of customers would top that list. Employers benefit from hiring individuals who have completed a food handler training course, as it demonstrates their commitment to food safety. And then there is the establishment of a business with a reputation of providing clean, safe food products. To protect a business' reputation of providing safe food handling is so great that most food service managers would pay more for employees who already have the certification. According to a Journal of Extension food service managers survey , approximately 72 percent indicated they would be more likely to hire food safety trained workers, and 50 percent would be willing to pay higher wages to those trained. Certification goes deeper than protecting public image though, it helps boost the credibility of the industry as a whole. FAQs Q: How do I get a Food Handlers Card ? A: To get a Food Handlers Card , you typically need to complete a food safety training course accredited by your local health department or an approved provider. After completing the course, you may need to pass an exam to demonstrate your understanding of food safety principles. Once you pass the exam, you'll receive your Food Handlers Card , certifying that you've met the necessary requirements to handle food safely. Q:How much is a food handlers permit ? A: The cost of a food handler's permit can vary depending on your location and the provider offering the training. Typically, it ranges from $10 to $50. You may also need to renew the permit periodically, which could involve additional fees. It's best to check with your local health department or approved training provider for specific pricing information. Q: Is a food handlers card the same as an ServSafe ? A: A food handler's card typically certifies that an individual has completed basic food safety training , often through an online training course . In contrast, ServSafe is a more comprehensive certification program that covers various aspects of food safety management, including supervisor training, alcohol service, and allergen management.

Imagine having an all-star team, full of players who are committed, productive, and invested in your company's vision. That‚Äôs the power of effective employee retention strategies . This isn‚Äôt about merely preventing high employee turnover but creating an environment where people don‚Äôt want to leave. It‚Äôs about building a work culture that can increase employee retention and breathes life into careers while fulfilling business goals. Are you ready for this journey towards enhancing job satisfaction and fostering growth opportunities ? Understanding Employee Retention If you're a business leader, it is essential to guarantee that staff remain in the organization. Why? Because employee retention impacts everything from team morale to the bottom line . The cost of replacing employees can be hefty. According to Gallup , it ranges from 0.5 to 2 times an employee's annual salary . But don't fret, we've got some strategies that could help you improve this crucial metric. Key Factors Influencing Employee Retention To fix high employee turnover rates , first understand why people leave or decide to stick around. It boils down mainly to how valued and engaged they feel in their current workplace environment. A job isn't just about getting paid anymore; career growth opportunities matter too. And who doesn't love recognition for hard work? A great practice would be setting up recognition programs that make sure employees feel appreciated. Beyond appreciation though, offering support when needed is essential too. Open lines of communication allow managers not only to address concerns but also to celebrate successes along the way. In essence: Keep 'em happy, keep 'em long-term. Who knew reducing attrition was as simple (and complex) as making your team members genuinely satisfied at work? The Role of Compensation in Employee Retention Getting fair compensation plays a key role in retaining employees. Not just the figures on the paycheck, but also feeling appreciated for one's efforts is significant. Federal Minimum Wage vs Living Wage In comparing federal minimum wage and living wage across U.S counties, we see disparities that can affect employee retention rates . Many workers are barely getting by with their current wages, let alone saving for future needs or emergencies. Employee retention can be greatly improved through proper compensation. A MIT study shows companies providing fair pay have a 56% lower attrition rate compared to others who don't prioritize this aspect. This implies two things: First, if your business doesn‚Äôt offer competitive salaries or at least match industry standards you risk losing talented team members ; secondly, businesses need more than money - they must cultivate an environment where employees feel appreciated and engaged. Career growth opportunities also play a crucial part here. Offering professional development plans can help improve job satisfaction and reduce turnover rate . Plus setting clear communication channels open will ensure that your workforce feels heard ‚Äì another essential ingredient to increase employee retention . Creating a Positive Work Environment A positive work environment can be the secret sauce to improving employee retention . It's not just about the look or fancy coffee makers; it's more about cultivating an ambiance of encouragement, admiration, and transparent interaction. Employees who feel their worth is recognized in the workplace are far less likely to look for other opportunities. So let‚Äôs explore how we can create this supportive work environment that makes employees stay for the long haul. Communication is key Clear lines of communication help foster trust between team members and management. A culture where feedback is welcomed - both ways - lets everyone know they‚Äôre heard and appreciated. Employees need regular updates on business goals so they understand what role they play in achieving them. Forbes agrees with us here. We should also strive for a balanced workload Overworking leads to burnout , reducing job satisfaction which contributes towards high turnover rates . Striking a balance between hard work and downtime helps maintain productivity without overwhelming your team. Last but definitely not least ‚Äì Recognition. A simple 'thank you' or recognition program celebrating achievements goes a long way in making employees feel seen for their efforts. SnackNation has some great ideas here. Remember: Happy workers stick around longer. Enhancing Employee Engagement In a quest to increase employee retention , let's focus on enhancing engagement among team members . An engaged workforce is not just about employees being happy or satisfied; it's also about their passion and commitment towards the company‚Äôs goals. Implementing Employee Recognition Programs The key to boosting engagement lies in making your employees feel valued. One effective strategy for achieving this involves implementing recognition programs . Recognizing an employee's hard work makes them feel appreciated, leading to increased job satisfaction . Recognition doesn't always have to be grand gestures; even small acts of acknowledgement can make a significant difference. It could be as simple as praising someone at a meeting for their exceptional performance or highlighting their achievements in the company newsletter. This isn‚Äôt merely an HR initiative but should be woven into your company culture so that every member understands its importance and actively participates. From top management down, everyone should celebrate wins and encourage each other‚Äôs growth opportunities . Acknowledging efforts often results in more engaged employees who are less likely seeking opportunities elsewhere - thus improving employee retention rate . Making Work Fun with Engaging Activities Beyond recognition programs , another way to foster engagement is through fun activities that break up the monotony of daily tasks. This can include team-building exercises like problem-solving games or social events such as office parties or picnics. These initiatives create open lines of communication among team members while strengthening relationships within teams - factors crucial for creating environments where employees want to stay long term. Providing Growth Opportunities Growth opportunities are a key ingredient to retaining employees. When you give your team members chances for career development , they're more likely to stick around. Forbes highlights that offering clear paths for advancement makes employees feel valued and increases job satisfaction . Career Development Plans A crucial part of providing growth opportunities is implementing effective career development plans. These roadmaps guide your staff towards achieving their professional goals within your company, thereby reducing the risk of them seeking opportunities elsewhere. This system not only helps retain personnel, but also encourages a climate where diligence is rewarded with tangible advancement. Mentorship Programs In addition to formal development plans, consider mentorship programs as another strategy. By pairing less experienced workers with seasoned professionals in the company, newer recruits can get guidance and support while building relationships within the team. Creating an atmosphere of mutual investment in one another's success can help foster a positive work environment . Continuous Learning Opportunities Last but certainly not least - continuous learning. Encourage employees by giving access to online courses or hosting workshops that let them acquire new skills related directly (or indirectly) to their roles. Studies show that companies promoting continuous education have higher rates of employee engagement which directly links back to improved retention. Effective Recruitment and Onboarding Finding the right team members is a vital first step to improve employee retention . But remember, recruitment doesn't stop at just offering employees a job. The real work begins when new hires start their journey with your company. The role of recruitment in employee retention starts even before candidates apply for positions. By setting clear expectations during the recruitment process, businesses can ensure they're attracting those who are truly fit for their roles and culture. Once the offer has been accepted, it is imperative to ensure that onboarding is executed correctly for optimal retention of new hires . A study by SHRM showed that well-executed onboarding programs boost new hire retention by 82%. The Importance of Proper Onboarding Newly hired individuals need support from day one so they feel valued as part of the organization quickly. Effective onboarding should provide them not only with proper training but also insights into company culture . A strong start makes employees feel engaged from the outset while reducing high employee turnover rates down the line. And let's face it: replacing employees isn't cheap. SHRM estimates each lost employee costs up to twice their annual salary ‚Äîso investing in solid hiring practices pays off big-time. An open door policy can be great practice here too; making sure all lines of communication between management and newcomers remain wide open allows everyone involved to fix any potential issues promptly. This way, companies will not only retain top talent but also create more productive work environments where everyone feels appreciated‚Äîa win-win if there ever was one. Measuring and Improving Retention Efforts The road to better employee retention is paved with data. To start, you need to measure your current situation. Let's say you have a total number of 100 employees at the beginning of the year and only 85 stayed by the end; that gives you an employee retention rate of 85%. Can we improve even further? Digging deeper into your numbers might reveal surprising facts. For instance, are there specific teams or departments with higher turnover rates ? Are newly hired team members leaving sooner than existing ones? It's essential to identify these patterns as they could highlight areas where more support for employees is needed. Aligning Retention Strategies with Business Goals A successful approach involves aligning your strategies with business goals - a great practice often overlooked. By doing this, not only will you ensure employees feel valued and engaged in their work environments , but also create clear communication lines between company culture and its objectives. This alignment fosters career growth opportunities for each individual while serving larger business goals - kind of like killing two birds with one stone. Moreover, keeping employees informed about how their hard work contributes directly towards achieving those goals makes them feel appreciated and part of something bigger. As LinkedIn ‚Äôs Global Talent Trends Report suggests: Employees who see professional development plans tailored around both personal advancement and overall business success are more likely to stay on board. FAQs in Relation to Increase Employee Retention What are 5 ways to improve employee retention ? Boosting retention means offering competitive pay, fostering a positive work culture , recognizing and rewarding hard work, providing growth opportunities , and refining recruitment and onboarding processes . What does increase employee retention mean? Increasing employee retention refers to strategies used by companies to keep their staff longer. This reduces turnover costs and boosts productivity. How do you increase the employee retention rate ? To raise your company's worker stickiness rate: value your team with fair compensation; make sure they're heard; give them chances for career advancement; recruit right from the start; consistently gauge success. What are the 3 R's of employee retention ? The three R's stand for Respect, Recognition, Rewards - key factors in keeping top talent happy at your firm long-term. Conclusion Retaining top talent is the secret to a thriving business. You've learned how fair compensation, supportive work environments , and employee engagement can increase employee retention . Career growth opportunities keep your team members motivated. Effective recruitment and onboarding set them up for success from day one. But remember: always align your strategies with business goals. Track progress using key metrics to ensure you're moving in the right direction. Take these insights and put them into action!

For many franchise owners, this means hiring seasonal staff to meet the surge in customer needs. While seasonal hiring can be a powerful strategy to ensure a smooth and profitable season, it also comes with unique challenges. Let‚Äôs explore seven tips to help you hire seasonal employees and provide a consistent customer experience, even when demand is at an all-time high. 1. Iron out your processes Before you start posting your seasonal jobs,¬† it's important to check in on your existing hiring and onboarding processes . Efficiency is the name of the game here.¬†Consider implementing digital tools such as e-signatures for a simplified onboarding process. Automate as many HR tasks as possible, like resume screening, interview scheduling, background checks, and more. The goal is to make hiring and onboarding as efficient as possible so your seasonal staff can hit the ground running quickly. 2. Be clear about seasonality Transparency is key when hiring seasonal staff. It's essential to clearly communicate in your job postings that the roles you're offering are temporary and tied to a specific season. Specify the start and end dates of the employment, giving applicants a clear understanding of the commitment involved. If the position has the potential to become permanent, be upfront about it in the job description. Being candid about these details helps manage expectations and reduces the likelihood of conflicts arising later on. If you're looking to convert seasonal staff into full-time employees after the season ends, stating this upfront can attract applicants seeking long-term opportunities . 3. Let staff do the training Training seasonal employees doesn't have to be a burden; it can be an opportunity for existing team members to mentor and practice their leadership skills. ¬†Not only does this ease the workload for your managers, but it also helps your employees grow in their careers ( something that will also help with retention ). By sharing the responsibility of training, you empower your team to take ownership and create a supportive atmosphere that benefits both the seasonal staff and your permanent employees. 4. Anticipate your hiring needs Proactive planning is essential for successful seasonal staffing. Anticipate your hiring needs well in advance to avoid a last-minute scramble to fill open positions. This means understanding your historical staffing requirements, analyzing market trends, and forecasting demand. Additionally, consider establishing a pool of pre-screened seasonal candidates who can be readily contacted when positions become available. Building relationships with local schools, community organizations, and online job boards can help you tap into a diverse pool of potential seasonal employees. 5. Offer competitive compensation To attract top-notch seasonal talent, you need to offer competitive compensation packages. Seasonal workers often expect higher pay rates due to the temporary nature of their roles and the increased workload during peak seasons. Conduct market research to determine the prevailing wages for similar positions in your industry (the Hourly Wage Index can help!). Offering competitive pay not only helps you secure quality staff but also motivates them to perform their best during the busy season. There are also additional benefits beyond wages that may appeal to seasonal workers. 6. Provide a positive work environment Creating a positive work environment is essential for both seasonal and permanent employees. Seasonal staff should feel valued and included in the workplace culture. Consider organizing team-building activities, providing clear communication channels, and offering opportunities for feedback. Furthermore, prioritize workplace safety, especially during busy seasons when the risk of accidents can be higher. A safe and supportive work environment enhances morale and can lead to better overall performance. 7. Evaluate and adjust After the busy season dies down, evaluate the effectiveness of your seasonal staffing strategy. Analyze key performance metrics, including turnover rates, productivity, and customer satisfaction. Use this data to identify areas for improvement and make adjustments for the next season. Consider soliciting feedback from both seasonal and permanent staff to gain insights into their experiences and suggestions for improvement. Continuous refinement of your seasonal staffing approach will help you adapt to changing market conditions and ensure ongoing success. Staff up smartly Seasonal staffing is a vital component of many businesses' strategies for handling increased demand during peak seasons. By following these seven tips, you can optimize your seasonal hiring strategy and ensure top-notch customer experiences without sacrificing your permanent team's bandwidth and energy.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 04/04/24 Hiring Hacks: 20 sourcing ideas to help you attract hourly workers Share this article To stay ahead in today's fast-paced hourly job market, you need innovative sourcing strategies. Relying on job boards alone won't cut it. In fact, there are several sourcing strategies that are far more effective. To get you started developing a more creative sourcing strategy, here are 20 ideas that will attract applicants who aren't just looking for any job, they're looking for your job. 1. Get employees to post on social media Who better to promote your business on social media than the people on it 24/7? Let's be honest: your employees probably know the ins and outs of today's social media far better than you do. (Prove us wrong!) Tapping into their enthusiasm for the latest platforms and posting types is a great way to spread the word about your open roles. Encourage them to share their positive work experiences on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Ask them to share why they like their jobs, highlighting the unique aspects that make your company stand out. To sweeten the deal, offer them a gift card as an incentive for their participation. 2. Host a hiring fair Picture this: the smell of success wafting through the air as you reel in a crowd of potential employees from all walks of life. A hiring fair is a great way to attract a bunch of applicants from your local community. (Not to mention, it gets you in front of customers too!). Throw in a juicy signing bonus for anyone who accepts an offer on the spot and you'll be staffed up in no time. 3. Partner with community-based organizations Building strong ties with your local community can pay off in your search for qualified applicants. Chat with community-based organizations in your area and explore the possibility of forming partnerships. With their deep connections and local know-how, they'll serve up applicants that fit your values and needs. They're like the secret sauce to your hiring success. 4. Reach out to veteran organizations Supporting veterans as they transition to civilian life is both a noble endeavor and a smart recruitment strategy. Reach out to local veteran organizations and ask about potential partnerships. Veterans often bring unique skills and qualities to the workforce, making them valuable assets to any team. By collaborating with these organizations, you can tap into a talent pool that is dedicated and disciplined. 5. Participate in virtual career fairs The internet has opened up a world of possibilities for recruiting talent. Take advantage of virtual career fairs, where you can connect with potential applicants without anyone having to leave the couch.¬† These virtual events allow you to showcase your company culture, job opportunities, and benefits to a diverse and large audience. 6. Use QR codes and text-to-apply Convenience is key when it comes to job applications. Most applicants will give up on an application if it takes more than 15 minutes. Make it easy for them to find and apply for your job openings by using QR codes and text-to-apply numbers . Place these easy digital application tools on well-designed flyers at local community colleges or coffee shops so students and job seekers can quickly access information about your job openings right from their smartphones or tablets. 7. Maximizing your store receipts Take advantage of any and every possible marketing material‚Äîincluding store receipts. Print those text-to-apply numbers and QR codes right on your receipts so potential hires have a way to apply to your jobs in their back pocket (or purse or crumpled in their car's center console). Regardless of where it goes, they'll know where to find you and your job in a moment's notice. 8. Get on the local radio Don't underestimate the power of traditional media‚Äîit's like the classic hits that never go out of style. Ever thought about making a quick cameo on your local radio station? It's a golden opportunity to dish out the deets about the job opportunities at your organization. Radio waves have a knack for grabbing the attention of commuters and folks chilling at home, giving your recruitment efforts a boost beyond the digital realm. 9. Engage on Facebook community groups Social media platforms like Facebook have become hubs for community engagement. To tap into your local community's network and find potential candidates, share your job openings on relevant Facebook community groups. These groups are buzzing with active members ready to lend a hand, making them a goldmine for finding your next team member. 10. Explore niche job boards OK, I know we said you shouldn't go heavy on job boards, but it's all about having a diverse sourcing strategy‚Äîthat includes major job boards, but especially niche ones. T hese specialized platforms are treasure troves tailored to specific industries or skills. They're perfect for finding applicants with those special qualifications you're after. 11. Advertise in local print media In the digital age, print media may seem old-fashioned, but it can still be a valuable resource for reaching certain demographics. Consider placing advertisements in local newspapers or magazines that have a strong readership in your area. This approach can help you reach folks who might not be glued to their screens all day. 12. Network with local businesses Join local business networking groups to beef up your professional connections. By building bonds with fellow business owners and pros, you might just score some referrals or recommendations for top-notch applicants. 13. Offer coupons with QR codes You know how we recommended throwing QR codes on receipts? This works just as well on coupons. Offer a free menu item or other incentive, and include a QR code or text-to-apply number on the other side of the coupon. N ot only does it entice applicants to apply, but it also serves up a tasty perk. 14. Employee referral challenges Want in on a secret to finding top talent? Look no further than your own crew. Challenge your team to actively refer potential candidates from their networks . To motivate them even more, consider offering rewards if the team achieves a specific hiring goal within a week. This approach turns your employees into proactive recruiters. 15. Reconnect with previous applicants Remember those applicants who almost made the cut but just didn't quite fit the bill? Well, don't write them off just yet. Shoot them a friendly text and let them know your organization is still on the lookout for new hires. It's like reigniting the flame‚Äîyou might just spark their interest all over again and get them to reapply. 16. Leverage your personal social media Who said you weren't social media-savvy? Certainly not us! But honestly, your social media channels are just as valuable as your employees'. Share those job openings on platforms like Instagram or Facebook to cast your net even wider. Your circle of friends might just include the perfect fit for your team, and they could help spread the word like wildfire. It's like turning your social feed into a talent hub! 17. Customer recommendations Your customers can be an unexpected source of applicant leads. Train your team to ask customers if they know anyone who might be interested in applying for openings. Word-of-mouth referrals from satisfied customers can lead to awesome new hires. 18. Use oversized signs Sometimes, the simplest tactics are the most effective. Whip up some big ol' signs about your job openings and have your crew take turns waving them outside your business. Watch as passersby and job seekers alike can't help but take notice. 19. Create promotional videos Visual content can be a powerful tool for recruitment. Produce a video discussing job opportunities and benefits at your organization. Upload it to YouTube and invest in targeted promotion within your zip code. Nowadays, no one can resist a good video, and job seekers will be drawn to an engaging one that helps them land a job. 20. Spanish language outreach Hiring Spanish-speakers? Create job postings, hiring posters, applications, you name it, in Spanish. By making the hiring process easier to understand and follow, you open your applicant pool to a huge group of potential employees. The best applicants don't always come from job boards It's no longer just about hiring quickly. Owners and operators are looking for serious applicants who are more likely to stick around. By diversifying your sourcing strategy, you have a better chance of building a team that's excited about your business, your product, and their career with you.

Gen Zs are born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s, and as most have begun entering the workforce, they bring along unique qualities and expectations to the workplace. Organizations need to adapt their hiring and retention strategies to fully harness their potential. Here are seven key tips to attract and retain these Gen Z employees. 1. Create a culture of respect Respect is a cornerstone of any successful workplace, but Gen Z places particular importance on it . Starting with your application, demonstrate your respect for Gen Z applicants' time and energy. Simplify wherever you can: Eliminate the need for formal resumes Strip your application down to only the necessary form fields Only ask for the information you actually need Rethink how many phases of the interview process you need Next, be sure to be respectful of your applicants throughout the hiring process. Once you receive applications, respond promptly. This not only shows that you value applicants but also reduces the risk of losing them to competitors. By actively communicating, you pave the way for mutual respect within your Gen Z team, fostering a positive work environment. In addition to streamlining the application process, consider implementing interview techniques that align with Gen Z's values. For example, conduct panel interviews that allow multiple team members to assess candidates, showcasing your commitment to transparency and fairness. 2. Foster diversity and inclusion Gen Z is known for its diversity and inclusivity mindset. To attract and retain Gen Z employees, organizations must prioritize diversity and create an inclusive workplace culture . Actively promote diversity in recruitment, and ensure that your workplace policies and practices support inclusivity. Offer diversity training programs and create employee resource groups to foster a sense of belonging among Gen Z employees. When they feel valued and respected for their individuality, they‚Äôre more likely to stay with your company for the long term. Additionally, showcase your commitment to diversity and inclusion through external initiatives and partnerships. Participate in industry and community events focused on diversity. Gen Z employees appreciate companies that go beyond internal efforts to create positive social impact. 3. Provide predictable scheduling One common source of employee dissatisfaction is unpredictable scheduling. Imagine planning a trip with friends months in advance, only to find out that you're scheduled to work during those days. To avoid such conflicts, establish a clear scheduling system that allows team members to communicate their preferences in advance. Maintaining schedules at least two weeks ahead offers Gen Z employees the predictability they're looking for. It empowers them to make personal plans without the constant worry of last-minute work schedule changes and provides them with work-life balance. This commitment to predictable scheduling aligns with the culture of respect and significantly contributes to employee retention efforts. To further enhance scheduling satisfaction, consider implementing innovative scheduling software that enables employees to swap shifts easily and efficiently. This technology-driven approach not only empowers Gen Z workers but also demonstrates your organization's commitment to modern solutions. 4. Offer a purpose Gen Z employees seek meaning in their work. While this may seem challenging in a fast-paced industry like quick-service restaurants (QSRs), it‚Äôs entirely possible. Finding ways to infuse purpose into their roles can have a profound impact on retention. According to McKinsey, Gen Z is known for idealism and demands purpose and accountability . For extroverted Gen Z workers, encourage them to engage in meaningful interactions with customers. These interactions can create a sense of purpose as they positively impact the customer experience. Moreover, offering opportunities for training new employees or assuming leadership roles can provide a sense of accomplishment and purpose for other team members. Employees who feel they‚Äôre making a difference, whether in customers' lives or their coworkers,‚Äô are more likely to remain committed to your organization. By nurturing this sense of purpose, you can tap into Gen Z's desire for meaningful work. Additionally, consider implementing a recognition and rewards program that highlights and celebrates employees who consistently contribute to the company's mission and values. Acknowledging their efforts and impact can reinforce their sense of purpose and commitment. 5. Embrace technology Gen Z has grown up in a digital age, and they expect technology to be integrated into their work environment. To attract and retain Gen Z talent, it's essential to embrace technology and provide digital tools that streamline work processes and enhance productivity. Consider investing in user-friendly apps and software solutions that simplify tasks and improve communication among team members . Additionally, provide opportunities for Gen Z employees to contribute their technological expertise, making them feel valued and engaged in the workplace. Moreover, foster a culture of innovation and continuous improvement by encouraging Gen Z employees to suggest and implement technological solutions that can optimize operations and customer experiences. By involving them in shaping the technological landscape of your organization, you not only meet their expectations but also enhance their job satisfaction and loyalty. 6. Promote work-life balance Achieving a healthy work-life balance is a priority for Gen Z. They value their personal time and well-being, and they appreciate employers who understand this need. Encourage regular breaks, offer flexible scheduling options, and promote the importance of self-care. By accommodating work-life balance, you not only attract Gen Z workers but also increase their job satisfaction and overall productivity. A well-balanced team is more likely to stay committed and contribute positively to your organization. Furthermore, consider offering wellness programs and resources, such as gym memberships or mental health support, to support the well-being of your employees. Demonstrating a genuine concern for their physical and mental health reinforces your commitment to their holistic happiness. 7. Encourage learning and development Gen Z is eager to learn and grow in their careers. To retain these ambitious employees, provide opportunities for continuous learning and skill development . Offer training programs, mentorship opportunities, and clear paths for career advancement. By investing in their professional growth, you demonstrate your commitment to their long-term success. This not only enhances job satisfaction but also ensures that your Gen Z employees remain engaged and loyal to your organization. Consider establishing a learning and development committee or department that focuses on identifying and addressing the specific developmental needs and aspirations of Gen Z employees. Regularly assess their career goals and provide tailored support, such as workshops, online courses, or access to industry certifications. Moreover, create a culture of knowledge sharing within your organization, where experienced employees can mentor and guide Gen Z workers, fostering a collaborative and supportive learning environment. Build loyalty with a motivated workforce In a rapidly changing job landscape, businesses must adapt their strategies to attract and retain Gen Z employees successfully. These digital natives bring fresh perspectives and unique values to the workplace, making them valuable assets to any organization. By catering to the characteristics of Gen Z,¬† businesses can tap into their potential and build a dedicated and motivated workforce that contributes to long-term success. Achieving these goals requires ongoing commitment and adaptation, but the rewards are significant. Organizations that prioritize the needs and aspirations of Gen Z employees are more likely to thrive in today's competitive job market and secure a loyal and talented workforce for the future.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 01/16/24 How to start a ghost kitchen Share this article Have you ever ordered food from a ghost kitchen ? A lot of people have without even knowing it. And, as crazy as it may sound, that‚Äôs part of the appeal of opening one. Consumers don‚Äôt even need to know it exists before becoming regular customers. Plus, the potential market share is huge! According to CBRE Research and Hospitality Technology, the ghost kitchen market share of¬† U.S. restaurant sales is expected to reach 21% by 2025 and be worth $71.4B by 2027 . So, the ghost kitchen concept is revolutionizing the food service industry, with delivery platforms playing a crucial role. The demand for delivery-only restaurants is skyrocketing, especially in urban areas with limited dining room space. So, how do you get your slice of the ghost kitchen pie? And what do you need to know to give yourself the best shot at success? Those are the questions we‚Äôll be helping you answer in this article as we explore the ghost kitchen concept , business license , menu items , and more. Examples of successful virtual kitchens How to pick the right ghost kitchen model The pros and cons of opening one The 5 essential steps to start one in 2022 But let‚Äôs kick things off by looking at what makes them different from traditional restaurants . What is a ghost kitchen? A ghost kitchen is a restaurant kitchen space used solely to make food for delivery and takeaway orders. Unlike traditional brick-and- mortar restaurants , the main staff on-site are chefs, cooks, and the people who package delivery orders . All customers‚Äô orders come directly via third-party delivery service apps or a restaurant‚Äôs online ordering platform. A ghost kitchen , also known as a delivery-only concept or virtual brand , operates exclusively for takeout and pick-up orders, bypassing the traditional restaurant industry setup. Instead of a bustling front-of-house scene, it's all about efficient food preparation and packaging by kitchen staff . These kitchens run on delivery drivers and online ordering platforms, saving on real estate and operating costs associated with a traditional storefront setup. Ghost kitchens are also sometimes referred to as cloud kitchens , virtual kitchens , dark kitchens , or ghost restaurants . All of those terms mean the same thing. But there are different ghost kitchen models that you‚Äôll want to know about if you‚Äôre interested in setting up and running one yourself. We‚Äôll look into those distinct models later. But, first, let‚Äôs look at some examples to give you an even better idea of how this new concept works. Ghost kitchen examples Guy Fieri‚Äôs Flavortown Kitchen is one of the most famous and fastest-growing ghost kitchens in the country. Flavortown Kitchen currently has 23 locations across the U.S., mostly operating out of the kitchens of restaurants like Buca di Beppo, Brio Italian Grille, Bravo Italian Kitchen, and Bertucci‚Äôs. This innovative business plan allows Flavortown Kitchen to leverage established restaurant food business infrastructure for rapid expansion. Another popular ghost kitchen , Pasqually‚Äôs Pizza & Wings , operates out of the kitchens of Chuck E. Cheese restaurants. This ghost kitchen model has helped Chuck E. Cheese recover some of its financial losses (as a result of the pandemic ) and reach new markets while still using the same ingredients and offering a somewhat similar menu. Furthermore, this ghost kitchen strategy has enabled Pasqually‚Äôs Pizza & Wings to enhance its in-person dining experience, bolster its restaurant brand , and attract more foot traffic to its physical location . How do ghost kitchens work? We‚Äôre sure you‚Äôd agree: the basic concept of ghost kitchens is fairly easy to understand. It‚Äôs a virtual restaurant that exists only as a kitchen preparing delivery and takeaway orders. But, as we mentioned, there are different ghost kitchen models to suit different needs. Let‚Äôs take a look at those now. Commissary Kitchens The most popular model is the commissary kitchen . Owned and rented out by an entrepreneur or third-party service, commissary kitchens are a shared kitchen space among several virtual restaurants that pay a membership fee or rent the space by the hour. The main benefits of using commissary kitchens are flexibility, convenience, and (most of all) price. Since you do not own the facility, the setup and maintenance costs are low. Additionally, commissary kitchens often boast state-of-the-art Point of Sale ( POS ) systems tailored to the unique needs of virtual restaurant operations. These POS solutions streamline order management, inventory tracking, and sales reporting, empowering restaurateurs to make data-driven decisions and optimize their performance. Commercial Kitchens For more established restaurants with large quantity orders, commercial kitchens tend to be the best option. Commercial kitchens are usually larger, have all of the essential kitchen equipment, and are rented for private use. The main benefit of using commercial kitchens is that it‚Äôs a private kitchen space that is used only to prepare orders for one restaurant. Moreover, commercial kitchens provide ample space for staffing requirements, ensuring that restaurant operations run smoothly even during peak hours. This setup allows restaurateurs to focus on efficient workflows and maintain high-quality standards in food preparation and service. Also, commercial kitchens offer an ideal environment for implementing effective restaurant marketing strategies . Incubator/Pop-up kitchens Incubator/Pop-up kitchens operate out of extra kitchen space in brick-and- mortar restaurants and food trucks . Within that space, workers focus exclusively on preparing online and delivery orders . By creating this separate space and workflow, other restaurant workers are freed from the responsibility of preparing both dining and delivery orders . The main benefit of incubator/pop-up kitchens is that they allow existing restaurants to experiment with new revenue streams. Pasqually‚Äôs Pizza and Wings virtual restaurants , which we mentioned earlier, are an example of this model as they operate out of the kitchens of Chuck E. Cheese restaurants. Furthermore, these kitchens serve as incubators for small businesses and startups in the food industry . Entrepreneurs can test their concepts and menu items in a low-risk environment before committing to a full-scale operation. This setup fosters innovation and creativity within the food industry , allowing for the exploration of new culinary trends and flavors. Kitchen Pods Kitchen pods are small ghost kitchens with only essential supplies and equipment since they are usually built-in shipping containers. This setup makes kitchen pods easy to transport to different locations (e.g. parking lots) and directly serve customers for takeaway orders. The main benefits of kitchen pods are their mobility and cheap start-up costs . However, due to limited kitchen space , it can be difficult to provide safe, adequate working conditions and enough physical space to prepare orders. Entrepreneurs seeking to establish their own ghost kitchens can explore the option of kitchen pods. These compact setups offer a convenient solution, especially for those looking to enter the food industry with limited resources. With their modular design, kitchen pods can be easily square away in diverse locations, maximizing exposure and catering to varying customer demands. Pros and cons of ghost kitchens The ghost kitchen business model is promising, given the current preference many consumers have for delivery and takeaway orders as a result of the ongoing pandemic . Additionally, ghost kitchens provide an opportunity for culinary innovation and experimentation without the constraints of a traditional dining establishment. But before you decide to give opening a ghost restaurant a try, there are also some drawbacks you might want to consider. One potential challenge is the lack of a physical storefront , which may limit visibility and foot traffic . So, let‚Äôs now take a look at some of the major pros and cons. Pro #1: Low Cost Running a ghost restaurant is a lot cheaper than running a traditional restaurant . Since you only need kitchen space , you save a lot on operational and overhead costs . As, you can optimize staffing by focusing solely on kitchen staff , reducing labor expenses associated with hiring customer-facing roles like servers and hosts. This streamlined approach helps minimize expenditure, making it an attractive option for small businesses aiming to maximize profitability. Pro #2: Flexibility and Experimentation One significant advantage of ghost kitchens is their inherent flexibility, allowing operators to adapt and pivot swiftly as market demands change. This agility enables experimentation with menu items and offerings to gauge customer preferences accurately. For instance, should a particular item fail to garner traction or face supply issues, it can be promptly removed from the menu, ensuring optimal resource utilization and customer satisfaction. Pro #3: Wider customer reach In the past, restaurants only served people onsite with limited occupancy. Ghost kitchens revolutionize the traditional restaurant model by expanding your potential customer base beyond physical constraints. With no limitations on table turnover, you can accommodate more orders and serve a larger volume of customers each day. Through strategic restaurant marketing tactics, you can effectively promote your virtual eatery to a broader audience, reaching diners from various locations within your vicinity. Con #1: Third-Party App Fees and Algorithms While using third-party food delivery apps such as Uber Eats , DoorDash , and GrubHub can enhance your restaurant's visibility and attract more customers, it comes at a cost. These platforms often charge steep commission fees, sometimes reaching up to 30% of each order. Moreover, your restaurant's visibility and exposure are subject to the algorithms of these delivery apps , over which you have little to no control. Con #2: Limited Interaction with Customers One significant drawback of operating a ghost kitchen is the lack of direct interaction with customers. Unlike traditional brick-and- mortar restaurants , where you can engage with patrons face-to-face, transactions in ghost kitchens occur solely through third-party apps. Consequently, these platforms often retain all customer data and insights, depriving you of valuable information for personalized marketing strategies and customer retention efforts. Con #3: Difficult to Build and Manage Your Brand Managing your brand in the virtual realm of ghost kitchens poses significant challenges. Your ghost kitchen ‚Äôs online presence is all you have when it comes to branding. Given that these platforms often serve as the primary point of interaction with customers, maintaining a positive reputation is crucial. And, most of that online presence exists entirely on third-party apps where reviews can make or break how customers perceive your restaurant. A few bad reviews can hurt your restaurant's visibility and orders, highlighting the vulnerable nature of brand management in the digital age. How to start a ghost kitchen So, you‚Äôve reviewed those pros and cons and still think starting a ghost kitchen is the right move for you? Fantastic! Here are the five essential steps to set one up in 2022. Step 1 - Create Your Concept Which ghost kitchen model makes the most sense for you? Will your kitchen host one or multiple virtual restaurants ? Who are your target customers? Answering these questions from the start will help you develop your positioning strategy and stand out among competitors. It will also help you narrow down your menu offerings and determine how to best market your virtual restaurant (s) to customers. Additionally, conducting thorough market research can provide valuable insights into consumer preferences and behaviors. Step 2 - Find a Kitchen Next, you‚Äôll have to find a kitchen space that suits your preferred ghost kitchen model. For instance, if you're focusing on delivery-only operations, renting a commissary kitchen could be the most practical choice. To find available commercial and commissary kitchens for rent, check out platforms like The Kitchen Door . Alternatively, if you have access to the necessary resources and networks, consider setting up an incubator kitchen or kitchen pod to streamline your operations. Step 3 - Choose Your Delivery Method You can either deliver meals using your in-house delivery team or by partnering with third-party delivery apps . As we mentioned earlier, there are pros and cons to both options. While third-party apps simplify the process, the commission rate might not be worth it. If you opt to use an in-house delivery system, ensure you have enough labor to prevent compromising your food quality and customer service. Consider implementing a hybrid approach where you utilize both methods to maximize reach and efficiency. Step 4 - Hire Staff Luckily, ghost kitchens don‚Äôt need many staff members onsite. You just need to hire enough cooks to prepare the food and workers to package and manage online orders . That being said, hiring staff amid a pandemic and labor shortage isn‚Äôt exactly easy. So, you may want to use a restaurant hiring solution like Workstream that can help streamline your hiring process and get open roles filled quickly. Step 5 - Establish your online presence Your online presence plays a vital role in determining the success of your virtual restaurant . Build a website and create social media accounts for your business so your customers can engage with you. These online marketing tactics are cheap and effective in reaching out to your potential customers . You can also run marketing promotions on third-party apps to entice new customers to try your menu. Consider using search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to improve your website's visibility and attract more organic traffic. Additionally, regularly update your social media profiles with engaging content, such as behind-the-scenes glimpses of your kitchen operations, chef's specials, and customer testimonials, to foster a sense of community and loyalty among your followers. Final thoughts If you want to start a ghost kitchen , the best time to do it is as soon as possible. As we‚Äôve shown in this article, there is a ton of demand for this restaurant business model now and in the future.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 01/12/24 Great culture fit interview questions Share this article Conducting an interview is probably the best way to get to know your candidate‚Äôs core values inside out. And if we‚Äôre being honest, looking for a candidate who is a good culture fit is just as important as finding someone with the relevant skills for the position. These days, it‚Äòs not just about experience, qualifications, or work ethic . You want someone who can be a good culture fit as this would improve employee engagement, retention and satisfaction. Why is culture fit important? Culture fit is essentially the matching of the employees‚Äô and employers‚Äô values and ideas. This does not mean that everyone in the company has to be identical. In fact, a diverse workforce will reflect a great culture. The key here is to find out how well an individual can work with people in your company. At Workstream, we stress on the importance of cultural fit interview questions when hiring as it can bring many benefits to your company. For one, employees who can see how well they fit in the company have a higher motivation to work, which impacts their productivity . It also creates a stronger sense of belonging , improving employee engagement and hence, retention rates in your company. During the interview Create a good impression An interview is not just meant for you to judge a candidate‚Äôs cultural fit. It also provides an opportunity for the candidate to get a sense of your company‚Äôs culture. Thus, everything that you do matters. From greeting the candidate at the beginning to your etiquette during the interview itself‚Äîall of these interactions reflect the culture in your company. Ask the right culture fit interview questions To get to know the type of person your candidate is, it‚Äôs crucial for you to ask the right questions in the job interview . Here‚Äôs a tip from Lee-Anne Edwards , CEO, and founder of talent matchmaking firm, OneinaMil: ask questions pertaining to how a candidate is like outside of work through hypothetical scenarios. This gives you an idea of their personality, what exactly motivates them and whether it complements your company culture. Don‚Äôt fret, we will be going through some of the questions that you may use to draw out the right candidate for your company in the next section. Find the right balance While hiring for organizational fit is important, it‚Äôs not the only aspect that matters. Ultimately, it is about finding the right balance between experience and culture fit . For Lee-Anne, ‚Äú culture fit wins every time.‚Äù That is if she was presented with a non-ideal situation where a candidate has a perfect fit but lacks technical expertise, she will be willing to take them in as a long-term investment. As long as the candidate is coachable and is willing to learn, she thinks that half the battle is already won. Beyond a candidate being coachable, their willingness to collaborate across team's is another invaluable skill to screen for during the interview process . If the candidate‚Äôs values align with the company values then more often than not that candidate will be an awesome culture add . The process of hiring a new employee carries with it potential risks and rewards for existing employees; hiring a great new employee can up-level everyone's work, their ability to solve problems as a team, and their overall satisfaction with the company. On the flip-side, a bad hire can be an obstacle for the pre-existing team, and even cause them to consider looking for another job! Nonetheless, always remember to reach a consensus with your team on the balance all of you would like to have regarding cultural fit and technical expertise prior to the interview. Top culture fit interview questions To prepare you for the ideal interview, here are the top cultural fit interview questions: 1. What is your ideal work environment? ‚Äã‚Äã2. Which managerial style do you find most effective? 3. Do you prefer working alone or as part of a team? 4. What motivates you? 5. What are your hobbies outside of work? 6. How heavily do you rely on technology while working? 7. Share an example of when you went out of your way to please a customer. 8. What is the biggest challenge you faced in your previous workplace? 9. What approach do you use for solving issues at work? 10. Tell me about an incident when you and your team leader had opposing views. It‚Äôs best if a candidate uses the STAR framework to answer these culture fit interview questions. If they don‚Äôt, ask them follow-up culture interview questions based on the STAR approach to probe them further in giving more details in their answers. Now let‚Äôs dive into each question we‚Äôve shortlisted. 1. What is your ideal work environment? The purpose of this question is self-explanatory and is probably the most effective question to determine an individual‚Äôs cultur fit. Based on their reply, you can ascertain whether they will be happy when working in your organization. What to look out for in candidates‚Äô responses: You want someone who is able to seamlessly fit into the general working style of your company. Based on their answer, determine whether the structure of your company will complement them or tire them out. A few small differences should not be a problem. But, if the incompatibility is too drastic to ignore, consider going with a different candidate. For example, look for a candidate who thrives in a fast-paced environment and is constantly seeking to learn. In the QSR industry, hourly employees need to be able to adapt to new technologies‚Äîso the candidates that‚Äôs always looking for ways to learn will have a better chance of thriving. Also, an exceptional candidate will be able to weave in your company‚Äôs vision and mission into their answer as well. Keep your ears open to listen for that. 2. Which managerial style do you find most effective? A manager plays a critical role in an organization, especially in the QSR industry where they‚Äôre essential to ensuring that the fr ont-end operations of the restaurant run smoothly. This question is important because it will help you identify whether or not the candidate will be able to work well under your company‚Äôs management style. It also allows you to prevent any potential friction between a manager and employee, which can negatively affect the company‚Äôs operations. What to look out for in candidates‚Äô responses: Listen for queues that would tell you whether the candidate would work well under the company‚Äôs managerial style. For example, are managers more hands-on, or are employees expected to be independent in their learning? If it‚Äôs the latter, you will definitely want to hire someone who can take charge of their own learning without much supervision. 3. Do you prefer working alone or as part of a team? This is a very important question as a large element of a company‚Äôs culture is how its employees are expected to work. In most QSRS, employees work in an open environment and collaboration with colleagues is frequent. Asking this question lets you know whether the candidate‚Äôs preferred working style will empower or hinder their ability to thrive in your organization. What to look out for in candidates‚Äô responses: In QSRs, a team member often performs one task that is part of a much bigger process. Each person depends on others on the team to perform their tasks so that the team can collectively accomplish goals. Because of this, having a team-oriented individual is often very important. Look for candidates who prefer a collaborative working style. However, try not to write off those who prefer to work independently. While some do favor working alone, they may still be flexible enough to work well in a team. 4. What motivates you? Needless to say, this question lets you in on what makes an individual tick and is a way to determine whether their motivators will be compatible with their job duties. It also gives you insights into their priorities while on the job. What to look out for in candidates‚Äô responses: Look for motivators that are in line with your company‚Äôs aims and structure. For example, if you are a QSR franchise owner and your company‚Äôs aim is to provide a good experience for all of your customers, a candidate who thrives on their passion to serve people is probably the right candidate to hire. 5. What are your hobbies outside of work? As Lee-Anne mentioned, knowing what a person is interested in outside of work gives you insight into their personality and lets you discover the genuine person within. Asking this question will let you gauge the type of person they are, not only in a working environment but outside of it as well. And for all you know, you may even shape their key characteristics into personal brands, making it easier to decide if they really do fit into your company. What to look out for in candidates‚Äô responses: Listen for the type of activities a candidate engages in. It will give you a clue about how they work in relation to colleagues and how they engage with their tasks. For example, a person who plays on a sports team and regularly trains after work shows they have a commitment to a team. A solid candidate will also be able to showcase how their hobbies gave them an opportunity to develop soft skills and grow as a person. Consider the importance of these skills and whether they are highly valued in your company. 6. How heavily do you rely on technology while working? There‚Äôs no doubt that we‚Äôre living in an increasingly tech-savvy world. And for industries such as the QSR, processes are becoming more and more automated. To assess whether a candidate is a good fit with the company technologically, you may ask this question to gauge how much they rely on technology to get a job done. What to look out for in candidates‚Äô responses: Preferably, you want to hire a person who is comfortable with technology. And if they are not, make sure that they have a learner‚Äôs mindset and are willing to learn new technological processes that the company may introduce. 7. Share an example of when you went out of your way to please a customer. If your organization is a company that prioritizes customers, you can never go wrong with an employee who puts their customers before anything else. For QSRs, customers are paramount. Asking this question lets you know how far an individual is willing to go to keep their customers happy. What to look out for in candidates‚Äô responses: Listen for a concrete example that showcases the candidate‚Äôs exemplary interaction with a customer. Was their attitude and action in serving the customer aligned with how your company operates? If yes, then it‚Äôs safe to say that the candidate will assimilate well into the company. 8. What is the biggest challenge you faced in your previous workplace? By asking this question, you‚Äôre able to get an idea of any potential problems that are likely to arise should the candidate work in your organization. You may also have a better understanding of how this applicant deals with challenges in the workplace. What to look out for in candidates‚Äô responses: A challenge may not necessarily reflect badly on the candidate. Rather, pay attention to how they addressed it. Watch for responses that clearly showcase the actions taken by the candidate to resolve the challenge they faced. Depending on their answer, you‚Äôll be able to gauge their problem-solving skills. 9. What approach do you use for solving issues at work? This question gives you a chance to identify your candidate‚Äôs critical-thinking and decision-making skills. Depending on the nature of the industry, certain methods of solving are more efficient than others. Use this question to gauge if the candidate will be able to successfully resolve issues in your company. What to look out for in candidates‚Äô responses: For positions that are customer-facing with a bustling environment, look for candidates who are able to think on their feet and manage issues proactively. Additionally, take note of the way the candidates resolve their problems. Do they usually implement solutions by themselves or do they consult their peers before taking action? The workplace culture in your company may be more suited to one than the other. 10. Tell me about an incident when you and your team leader had opposing views. Disagreements are a normal occurrence in any team, and each member has a role to play in ensuring it does not escalate into something detrimental for the team. Thus, this last question helps to provide insights on the candidate‚Äôs communication and, possibly, conflict-resolution skills. What to look out for in candidates‚Äô responses: Watch for an individual who is able to articulate their ideas well to the team and, yet, overcome criticism when they are met with it. Following up after culture fit interview questions Undoubtedly, humans are subject to bias. And when that bias creeps into your ratings of applicants, you see problems. To help mitigate that, conduct a debriefing meeting to consolidate the culture fit assessments of each candidate. This will help remove unconscious bias from the equation and allow interviewers reach agreement on how each candidate interviewed. During these meetings, you‚Äôll want to cover three essential things: each interviewer‚Äôs first impression of the candidates, a review of the responses given and questions asked by the candidate, and a final vote for the top candidate based on the information shared by everyone. An ideal candidate will have the skills needed for the job and will be a culture fit for your company. However, if you‚Äôre not able to find that, make a decision based on who you feel comes the closest and meets the majority of the characteristics your organization is prioritizing. Culture fit is a valuable aspect of a candidate that should never be overlooked. Consider using some of the culture fit interview questions we have listed above and you might just find the perfect hourly employee for your organization. And when perfect candidates are hard to find, establish a balance between their technical expertise and cultural fit. The key takeaway here is to always take cultural fit into consideration as it can bring more advantages to your company than you would expect.

This stands out as one of the most innovative HR initiatives implemented by a large company. It gives employees the ability to donate some of their vacation time to another colleague and can be used in many other ways. This policy applies to most of their staff, but today, we'll focus on how part-time employees instead of full-time employees can use it. Most often, part-time hires don't enjoy the same perks even in their sick time that full-time workers do. With this policy, they can get some valuable benefits, such as an alternative to paid leaves when it comes to work-life balance . Employees can donate up to two weeks or any other dedicated amount of time of their PTO to help out their coworkers and improve their mental health . There are many companies doing great things to empower human resources to retain their top talent , from sales associates to top talent . In this article, we will explore how this policy works for Best Buy and what hourly workers can gain from it. Best Buy 's 'Gift of Time' Policy Discover how Best Buy 's innovative 'Gift of Time' policy, including PTO time benefits, enhances flexibility and support for hourly workers to enjoy personal days , fostering a more balanced work-life dynamic. Increased Flexibility in Their Schedule For many part-time employees , it's not about the money or dedicating themselves to a certain career and position. The most important thing for them is to have some flexibility in their schedule. This is so that they are able to plan their schedule well, be it to study, develop their skills, or find jobs with better prospects. This policy allows Best Buy employees to have greater control over their paid time off , enabling them to fulfill personal obligations such as caregiving or pursuing educational endeavors. This PTO policy gives Best Buy employees greater control over their paid time off . Ultimately, this is one of the company's many valuable employee benefits . By implementing this policy, employees are allowed to better control their time and make arrangements among themselves. For example, if an employee has to take care of a sick or elderly family member , their colleague can gift them vacation time so they can fulfill their filial obligations. Potential for More Vacation Time Let‚Äôs say a senior colleague wants to help his/her junior coworkers in getting more time off. They can do it easily with this policy. This is because the vacation time is calculated on a dollar-to-dollar basis rather than an hour to hour. Moreover, employees can leverage the PTO donation system throughout the calendar year , effectively extending their vacation time beyond what they would typically accrue. Simply put, if an employee who earns $15 per hour gives two hours to an employee who earns $10 per hour, that person will not receive two hours of vacation but three, as the amount of vacation given needs to be the same in financial terms. Here's what that calculation would look like: 2 hours x $15 per hour= $30, while 3 hours x $10 per hour = $30 This HR policy on donating vacation days is compliant with all the laws and company policies . Employees can use them freely without worrying about getting into trouble, as long as they fill out the necessary paperwork. Additional Time Off The key part of this policy is how employees can give their vacation time to others who need it more. They can donate up to four weeks to a colleague. Also, multiple employees can pool their vacation time for one person, as long as it's within the limit. Some part-time positions don't use all their vacation time . So, this policy lets them give it to someone in need due to emergencies. This kindness helps them without quitting or losing their job. Employees can agree to help each other next year if needed. At Best Buy , employees often give a colleague a bit of their vacation as a birthday gift. It's a precious gift for their special day. Ability to Deal with Serious Illnesses Under this policy, employees get extra vacation time for various needs, like caring for family members or dealing with serious illnesses. Sometimes, employees get sick when they've used up all their sick leave and vacation time , which can force them to quit. Employees who feel unwell can take sick days to rest and recover. Even former employees who worked at Best Buy for a long time can say how helpful this policy is. It shows that employee benefits matter even after leaving the company. It may seem tough, but some employees face this reality. With this policy, coworkers can support each other when needed most. As we can see, Best Buy ‚Äôs ‚ÄúGift of Time‚Äù policy has had great success in helping hourly workers out when it comes to their work schedules. Thus, it comes as no surprise that more companies are adopting this concept to create a better working environment for their employees. If you are an HR manager, consider implementing the ‚ÄúGift of Time‚Äù to give your staff a better working experience! Interested in finding more effective HR policies used in the industry?

That's what the STAR Method is all about. Job interviews are critical steps in the hiring process, and being well-prepared can make all the difference. Having worked with over 5000+ hiring managers from Chick-fil-A to Uber, we‚Äôve put together this ultimate interview guide. Specifically, we‚Äôll take a deep dive into behavioral questions and interview questions and answers , and why the STAR Method is the key to achieving them. Types of interview questions Before digging deeper into the STAR Method and its application, it's important to understand the different types of interview questions that are commonly asked. Two of the most popular types of interview questions are situational interview questions and common behavioral interview questions . Situational interview questions are questions that place an interviewee in a hypothetical situation. These types of questions aim to help interviewers understand how you would react in a particular situation, even if you‚Äôve never experienced it before. One such example would be the question, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made a mistake that no one else noticed. What would you do in such a situation?‚Äù These situational-based questions, such as customer service interview questions , can be helpful for managers when interviewing applicants who have no prior experience. These are also considered to be future-oriented situations that interviewers anticipate you may face, should you be offered this role. On the contrary, behavioral interview questions are part-oriented. Instead of placing interviewees in a hypothetical situation, you will be asked to describe a situation from your past experiences , often requiring you to describe situations from your previous job . Employers may inquire about your experience with customer service interview questions , such as handling difficult situations or ensuring a positive customer experience . At the core of behavioral questions, your interviewers are asking you to tell them a story. Through this recount, interviewers are trying to better understand how you think and approach different situations. Most importantly, they are trying to assess if they can potentially work with you, and decide if you are a good fit in the company culture. An example of a behavioral interview question would be ‚ÄúDescribe a situation when you had to work with someone whom you disliked as a person?‚Äù According to hiring managers we work with, most of their successful candidates adopt the STAR method of answering to tackle behavioral interview questions effectively. To further assess candidates, job interview questions may include inquiries about their ability to handle specific scenarios. For instance, ‚ÄúHow would you handle an angry customer ?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan you provide an example of a time when you demonstrated effective teamwork ?‚Äù When preparing for an interview, it's essential to thoroughly review the job description to understand the role's requirements and tailor your responses accordingly. Communication skills are often evaluated through questions about handling customer interactions and teamwork contribution. Employers may ask, ‚ÄúHow do you communicate with customers to ensure a positive experience?‚Äù or ‚ÄúDescribe a situation where your teamwork positively impacted a project. What is the STAR interview method? Having a great experience to share with your interviewer isn‚Äôt sufficient if you fail to communicate it effectively. The STAR Method allows you to present your answer in a more structured and coherent manner. This allows interviewers to be able to follow your narrative easily. 10x your odds of acing an interview Great, now you know what the STAR Method is. But there‚Äôs still much to be done if you want to land that dream job. Here‚Äôs an extremely important tip (we can‚Äôt stress this enough!) that many interviewees often overlook: WRITE YOUR STORIES DOWN. Before you even step into that interview room, you need to be armed with these preconceived stories and notable moments jotted down. We‚Äôre not just referring to the general storyline, but the specific details with carefully selected keywords and phrases. We call this the Story Toolbox. The Story Toolbox is a detailed library of your stories that are categorized based on some of the most popular behavioral questions. Building this toolbox will take time, but it trust us when we say, it‚Äôs worth it. These are the 7 Must-have Story Categories in your Toolbox: 1. Problem : A time when you solved a major problem or saved the day 2. Collaboration : A time when you were collaborative on a team and helped others 3. Leadership : A time when you became a leader and took charge 4. Difficult Co-worker : A time when you worked with a difficult colleague and how you handled it 5. Failure : A time you failed or messed up 6. Obstacle : A time when you overcame a major challenge or obstacle 7. Achievement : A time you achieved something great / something you‚Äôre proud of Spend some time to ponder about your past work situations that fit in these 7 categories. Ideally, these experiences should have occurred in the last 5 years. Then, proceed to use the STAR Method to document these experiences. You may notice that your stories can fit into multiple categories, and that is perfectly fine. If possible, come up with at least one unique story per category, and strive for two. Note that this list of 7 categories is not exhaustive, but from our statistical data, these are the 7 most common themes when asking behavioral questions. When noting your stories down, make sure you are concise, and take the time to select notable keywords . Interviewers dread lengthy stories, so be succinct. Having selected keywords helps you to recall your stories more readily, even if you can‚Äôt recite them verbatim during the actual interview. Before the interview, take some time to understand the job role that you applied for and the necessary skills and challenges that you may potentially face. When preparing for an interview, it's essential to thoroughly review the job description to understand the role's requirements and tailor your responses accordingly. Try to structure each of your experiences in your previous job following the STAR Method - start to describe your situation, task, action, and then result. If you are attending an interview as a customer service representative , your ability to showcase excellent customer service skills will greatly enhance your chances of success. Remember to provide real-life examples during your interview to demonstrate your competency and stand out as a candidate. Providing detailed and well-articulated interview answers can showcase your qualifications and suitability for the position. Also, when preparing for your next interview , don't forget to leverage LinkedIn to showcase the results of your actions and professional achievements. Social media platforms like LinkedIn can provide valuable insights into your accomplishments and impact. Bonus tip: Oftentimes, interviewees seek to portray themselves differently just to impress their interviewer. Avoid doing this, as interviewers are often able to tell if you are genuine and sincere in your responses. When discussing challenging situations, share specific examples and share how you navigated them with excellent customer service. Providing sample answers that highlight your soft skills can help you ace your next interview. Answering an interview question using the STAR Method Here‚Äôs a model example of the STAR Method in action: Question: ‚ÄúTell me about a time you worked with a colleague who was unreliable and didn‚Äôt complete the things he said he was going to do.‚Äù This question falls under the ‚ÄúDifficult Co-worker‚Äù category, which you are now well-prepared to answer having prepared your Story Toolbox. Answer: Situation (S): I was a Team Lead at the previous restaurant I worked at, where I was tasked with leading the morning shift team. Our team size ranged from 10 to 15 employees at any given time. Task (T): One of my tasks was to coordinate with the other shift managers and put together the weekly food wastage report. A problem arose when one of the night shift managers would constantly tell me that he couldn‚Äôt get his reports on time. This often happened right when the deadline was about to hit, and it impacted my ability to do my job on time and deliver my work consistently. Action (A): While many of my fellow managers suggested that I go straight to senior management, I respected him as a co-worker , and so I took the concern straight to him to talk things through. I first showed empathy and said ‚ÄúI can imagine you have so much you‚Äôre working on right now, and I can tell that you‚Äôre working hard. I wanted to discuss the past 3 deadlines that we set, and that you weren‚Äôt able to meet. When you don‚Äôt get me the wastage reports on time, it delays the entire reporting process and leads the rest of us to take several hours to readjust the schedule. Is there a way we can ensure that this doesn‚Äôt happen in the future?‚Äù Result (R) : While I was nervous about confronting him directly, I felt it was necessary to resolve the situation. Thankfully, he opened up to me about how he was also struggling to gather the information required for the report from his team members . Having already created a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with my team, I decided to share my routine with him. Knowing full well that each team has its idiosyncrasies, I suggested that we come up with a streamlined solution that fits his team‚Äôs work style. With our new solution, his team members had to submit a form with every report request before they could clock out, which enabled him to compile his numbers on time. Since then, he stopped putting off the task and we were able to generate the report on time. What is noteworthy about this story, is that it can also be tuned to fit a variety of different questions such as: Tell me about a time you had to deal with interpersonal conflict at work Tell me about a time you had to deal with a communication breakdown Tell me about a time when you took charge when your boss wasn‚Äôt around More examples of answering an interview question using the STAR Method STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result, which is a structured method used to effectively answer behavioral interview questions . Let‚Äôs try structuring another interview question using the STAR method . Question: ‚ÄúTell me about a time where you had to appease an unsatisfied customer.‚Äù This question falls under the category of ‚ÄúProblem‚Äù and ‚ÄúObstacle‚Äù. With the Story Toolbox, you are now fully equipped to take on this question. Answer: Situation (S): I was working as a server at a fast-food chain about 2 years ago. It was the peak period at a restaurant, and generally, with peak periods, our staff are often overwhelmed which results in increased waiting times. Unfortunately, these are the same periods in the day in which customers are in a hurry, and patience can sometimes wear thin. Task (T): During one of the peak dining periods, there was a couple who was dining in and we served one of their meals slightly later than the other person (say 15-20 minutes waiting time in between). They were highly displeased by the delay, especially since they thought the other dish would have been served soon after the first dish was served. In fact, they actually waited for the other dish, and by the time the final plate was served, the first dish was already cold. Evidently, this led to an unpleasant dining experience, and they expressed their frustration to me. Action (A): I am a firm believer in empathetic listening. After all, we have all been in frustrating situations as a consumer. I first stood by their table and listened attentively to their complaints. Subtle cues like occasional nodding and acknowledgment of our mistakes are, in my opinion, signals to the customer that they are heard. I proceeded to apologize, and shared my appreciation for their feedback. I assured her that as a team, we would continue to work on our processes, and going forward, we‚Äôll inform customers should we anticipate a longer wait between dishes. I then offered a 15% discount after consulting with my manager, along with a dining voucher for their next visit. Results (R): Thankfully, the customers did not make a huge fuss when I approached them. In fact, one of them shared their appreciation for me listening to their complaints in spite of the crowd. It was definitely encouraging to see their faces during subsequent visits, and we‚Äôd even exchange greetings like old friends thereafter. I was glad I took the time to listen to them despite the crowd. Let‚Äôs use the STAR Method for one other common question. Question: ‚ÄúDescribe a situation where you were under extreme pressure and the steps you‚Äôve taken to ensure that success is achieved.‚Äù We‚Äôve touched on different categories that focus on your problem-solving skills. This question falls under the category of ‚Äúachievement‚Äù where you should emphasize on the actions that you have taken to achieve success. Answer: Situation (S): I was a new member of the front-of-house team at a Steakhouse restaurant in Atlantic City. My primary responsibilities were as a server and buster, and two weeks into the job, I was presented with a daunting task. This scenario underscores the essence of adapting to a new customer service position and handling unforeseen challenges effectively. Task (T): One of my colleagues had to miss work, and I was asked to cover their shift. We were extremely short-handed that day, and the manager asked if I had the confidence to take over her role as a cashier. Being a fast-casual steakhouse, ordering and cashiering was undoubtedly complicated. This situation required quick competency acquisition and a decisive course of action . You had to ensure the doneness of each order was entered correctly, and failure to do so could cause the restaurant to incur unnecessary complaints and even wastage should they request for the steak to be redone. Action (A): I was placed under immense pressure to familiarize myself with the cash register, and there were no other seniors or experienced team members on the team to guide me throughout the service. This demanded quick competency acquisition and a course of action planning on my part. Thankfully, I found a manual for the register and I jotted down the steps that were required on a small post-it and stuck it to the register. While I was not nearly as efficient as some of my co-workers were at cashiering, I found that it was a great opportunity to demonstrate some of my specific situation handling skills. I would crack jokes with the customer while taking orders and constantly seek their kind understanding if it took a while longer. Sometimes, I would even make tiny digs at my speed, saying ‚ÄúHow hard could cashiering be right? It‚Äôs just a couple of buttons. Jeez, I never understood what took Jasmine so long in the past. Now I know.‚Äù Results (R): To my surprise, most of the customers did not seem to notice or even mind the slightly longer ordering time, demonstrating the importance of maintaining customer satisfaction even under pressure. I realized that people often feel impatient when disengaged, and my small talk and banter positively impacted their dining experience. While it may have been a small accomplishment to many, I felt extremely rewarded by the end of that shift. Apart from learning a new skill set, I think my main takeaway was how important it is to always provide great customer service . The customer service job isn‚Äôt just about speed. It‚Äôs also about the subtle acts of eye contact, smiles, and the occasional injection of humor.

As the app‚Äôs feature set grows‚Äîwith the introduction of things like Instagram Stories , which are time-based stories resembling that of Snapchat, and video channels known as IGTV, which functions similarly to Youtube‚Äîits user base also continues to grow. In 2021, they saw a 3.7% increase to 170 million users in the U.S. alone. Instagram is not only for personal use. Businesses around the world also use the platform to connect with their customers and prospects. Businesses posting high-quality content have the ability to reach such a wide audience if their content is captivating and this audience includes job seekers . Wondering how to hire on Instagram? Let‚Äôs dive in. Instagram job posting tips Instagram has always been known for its aesthetically pleasing feed. Users are accustomed to eye-catching visual content (with fewer words) to convey a message. So, be extra innovative with the visuals you use when you craft your Instagram job posting in order to attract the right candidates . Below are some tips on how you can do that. Tip #1: Use creative content consistent with your brand image Tip #2: Use striking colors and designs Tip #3: Use simple graphics to convey your message Tip #4: Remove clutter by opting for minimalism 2. Use tools Instagram offers many tools that help boost the visibility of your Instagram job posting. Use Instagram Stories Instagram Stories are a good way to approach on-demand and urgent hiring needs while incorporating your brand voice . Posting multiple times a day on Instagram Stories has fewer repercussions than posting several times to your feed. This is because excessive posting to your Instagram feed is considered spamming your viewers. Additionally, Instagram Stories increase the organic visibility of your brand (more so than posting to your feed). Instagram Stories reduce inertia for viewers since it automatically plays the next video without viewers having to manually scroll through it. Typically, once a user starts watching the stories, the video plays continuously one after another until they are caught up with all of the updates for the day. Need another ‚Äúpro‚Äù for posting an Instagram Story ? You don‚Äôt need elaborate artwork. Even if your content is longer and wordier, viewers will still read through it‚Ä¶ or listen to it. Poll your community The poll function engages users by allowing them to weigh in on a topic. This also serves as a useful tool for businesses to engage with their followers' networks. Take a look at the example below. By asking their viewers if they can recommend an eligible person for the job, the employer can tap into their community for candidates. This works especially well if you need to hire urgently since people can respond to the job ads in real time. Link back to your feed Instagram allows you to quickly create Instagram Stories based on an existing post on your newsfeed. This means that you can increase the visibility of your Instagram job posting. It also allows your followers to get more information with a simple tap, redirecting them back to the main post to learn more about your open role. Add important information to your Story Highlights Instagram Stories are evidently amazing, but there is one shortcoming: your content only stays for 24 hours. But don‚Äôt worry. With Instagram Highlights, you can permanently save your stories to your profile so your followers can view them later. This is especially useful for essential information that your potential future hires might want to know before applying for jobs at your company (ie. the culture of your company). 3. Keep text short Since Instagram focuses more on visuals and less on writing, companies should keep their captions short and informative. Tip #1: Use bullets or short paragraphs No one enjoys reading long, lengthy content on what your company has to offer. Get straight to the point and use bullets to convey the job responsibilities. If bullets aren't appropriate in your context, try separating the paragraphs with a divider, so it looks more organized and is easier to read. Tip #2: Use hashtags Hashtags are extremely useful to help track your now hiring Instagram post. You can use hashtags on both the feed and Instagram Stories. With the hashtag following functions, people who are interested in a topic can follow the specific hashtag to see more content from various users related to the topic of interest. In this case, hourly job-seeking applicants on Instagram may be following hashtags like #hiring, #jobsearch, and #jobhiring. By using hashtags, you can reach out to a wider range of potential applicants who are beyond your current following. Tip #3: Show off your brand personality People love brands that are fun and interactive. Show your viewers what kind of company culture they can expect upon applying for the job to get them interested. You can even use emojis to lighten the mood and appear more lively. 4. Include a call-to-action Call-to-action (CTA) buttons can be placed on the company's profile page under the \"contact\" function or even in the caption. The \"contact\" function is useful for interested job applicants because they can easily apply for the job without leaving Instagram. Most CTAs involve candidates sending resumes through your applicant tracking system or dropping a direct message to express interest. One of the more interesting CTAs is the ability to tag people. Since Instagram is primarily a social networking platform, information can be shared by friends simply tagging each other. This increases the post's visibility and helps you expand your reach further than your primary connections. 5. Run paid ads Another way to hire workers through Instagram is to run paid ads on the platform. With Instagram Stories' high visibility, companies can use Instagram Story ads to reach out and engage their target market better. These ads are effective because they show up between other users' stories while keeping the format of a story so that the user experience is uninterrupted. This also allows for full-screen advertisements without the clutter of other content, and hence, is more able to hold the user's entire active focus. If your company has 10,000 followers or is a verified account, you will be able to include the swipe-up function and attach a link to the story. With this function, viewers can easily submit their job applications without physically leaving Instagram. 6. Involve your current employees Who is better suited to endorse your company than your own employees? Having third-party endorsements often adds credibility to your organization, which helps widen your pool of candidates even further. Since birds of the same feathers flock together, chances are that your employees will attract like-minded individuals who are also a great fit for your company! But how do you get your employees involved? Well, an indirect way is to place your social media links in various areas in the workplace as some of them may not even know about your Instagram presence. Alternatively, you can always encourage them to post about your recruitment events or reward them for talking about their job on social media . Case study: Starbucks Starbucks‚Äô careers page on Instagram is a great example of how to bring this all together. Each post is highly representative of its brand. The text is concise and ends with a call-to-action that directs applicants to their hiring site to apply for the position. They were also creative with their visuals by using plays on words to catch their audience‚Äôs attention. One thing to note is the abundance of employee portraits on their profile. This gives prospective hires a sneak peek at how their jobs could be if they were to work in the famed coffeehouse. Starbucks also used the Story Highlights feature to park important information, such as their company benefits, to make it easily accessible for interested individuals. All in all, with the rising usage of Instagram among the working class, the platform serves as an opportunity for businesses to tap into a wider pool of applicants and attract like-minded individuals for their hourly job roles. As Instagram continues to evolve, users are becoming more open to business messages and would give it an extra look. So, what are you waiting for?

Lim's parents opened a donut shop in Los Angeles, and would often work 18-hour work-days to make ends meet. Growing up, Lim was no stranger to hard work as he would help at his parent's shop after school and work full time during the weekends. This experience of helping his parents and witnessing them toiling away shaped Lim‚Äôs strong work ethic that allowed him to build not one, but three businesses: Emazing Lights , iHeartRaves , and IntotheAM . Brian Lim first stepped into the Shark Tank 2 years ago with Emazing Lights and blew the sharks out of the water with his pitch on ABC's Shark Tank English TV show . To win the shark fight competitors present their innovative products ( shark tank products ) to convince sharks. Brian Lim showcased his iconic lighting gloves. His achievement was like a refreshing sweet gummy among all of the competitors in the show. Robert Herjavec called him the most impressive entrepreneur they ever had on the show, compelling all the sharks to make irresistible offers. Lim took on a deal with Mark Cuban and Daymond John ($650,000 for 5 percent equity and 20 percent commission on licensing deals ), and since then, his businesses have grown rapidly. His success story on \" Shark Tank US \" became one of the most talked-about episodes in the history of the show, inspiring entrepreneurs worldwide. The exposure he gained from this Shark Tank episode propelled his businesses to new heights, making him a household name and solidifying his place in the annals of TV show history. In an exclusive interview with Lim, he shared that he was largely influenced by his parents to start his own business. Seeing his parents work 7 days a week selling donuts for 30 cents per piece inspired him to work hard. Lim paid his way through college by working part-time and securing an impressive job at Deloitte. But Deloitte just didn‚Äôt cut it for him - it was too mundane and he craved to feel a sense of accomplishment. He wanted to work towards something that he could be proud of and make a difference in people's lives. Lim's passion for rave culture, particularly in the realm of electronic dance music , further fueled his entrepreneurial spirit, eventually leading him to dive into the vibrant world of music festivals . While working at Deloitte, he started to sell LED-powered gloves to kids at the local Jack In The Box store. He noticed that the kids enjoyed playing with the LED-powered gloves, and increasingly more kids would show up every weekend to buy his gloves. As demand became stronger, he took the plunge and left his job at Deloitte after 2 years to work on Emazing Lights full-time. And that was a risk he took that turned out incredibly well for him. It was challenging initially, but his passion for EDM and the growing popularity of gloving light shows at events like music festivals kept him going. In these events, glovers showcase their skills, creating mesmerizing light shows that captivate audiences and add to the vibrant atmosphere of the EDM scene. His robust work ethic saw him through countless nights and days of doing sales and operating the business. He credits his strong work ethic to his upbringing and working for his parents when he was young. Today, Lim runs a team of 50 full-time employees out of California , operates 3,000 square feet of warehouse space , and is on track to generate over $20 million in revenue this year. He is the sole founder and has remained very much hands-on with the business side of things. Being the visionary that he is, he looks forward to growing the business globally. Amidst all the success, he remains grounded and is very committed to giving back to the community. In fact, he organizes educational programs and community service events, in which he volunteers his time to help other disadvantaged children and kids. Brian Lim ‚Äôs diligence and humility are definitely some of the traits we can take away and possibly emulate to become a successful entrepreneur like him. Sometimes, it‚Äôs not about what you have but what you are willing to give and sacrifice.

In fact, as more candidates attempt to ‚Äòfake it, ‚Äòtill they make it‚Äô when going through this fast-track recruitment process, you must take cyber background checks extremely seriously to identify experienced candidates that match the skillset you require. Unlike contractors or in-house members of staff, hiring by the hour is becoming increasingly popular, especially among small businesses and start-ups. But the problem is, that filtering through freelancers and remote workers can be time-consuming and can often feel unnecessary since you might only be working together for a set number of hours or until a project is completed. In this article, we‚Äôre going to delve deep into this fresh take on the recruitment process and why cyber background checks should be your top priority. We‚Äôve also answer the top FAQs people have about this specific subject, so that you can make the best hiring decisions possible when it comes to hourly employees. Why You Need To Verify Hourly Employees Hourly employees are workers who are compensated for the number of hours they work, rather than a set salary. They might not have the same level of commitment to a company as a full-time salaried worker, given the flexible nature of their engagement. However pre-employment background checks are still important to carry out. Most companies often hire hourly when they require flexibility in their workforce due to varying workloads, seasonality, or project-based requirements. This model can be cost-effective, avoiding unnecessary overheads related to full-time employment. In fact, hiring hourly allows companies to tap into a vast pool of specialists and experts who prefer short-term engagements or project-based work. These professionals often bring a wealth of experience to the table, allowing companies to leverage their skills without long-term commitments. But that doesn‚Äôt mean to say that they shouldn‚Äôt go through the same level of employment screening as your team. Basic information such as their date of birth , and phone number should be provided when working with anyone new, but digging a little deeper and using screening services will often uncover any criminal charges or offences, alongside employment history . You never know what you might find when carrying out a civil search and this information could impact your employment decisions . Not All Freelancers Are Made Equal Like any hiring process , freelancers come with varying degrees of expertise, professionalism, and reliability. While some might be top-tier experts, others could lack the necessary skills or diligence, making verification crucial. That‚Äôs why you should aim to gather as much background information as you can to identify who they are, their level of experience and whether they are true to their word when it comes to employment history . What you need to verify when hiring by the hour: Skills and qualifications Previous work experience and references Online reputation and reviews Credit background check Digital footprint and online behavior Social security number Criminal background check Traditional Verus Cyber Background Checks A typical background check report will often encompass: Criminal Records : Information about felonies, misdemeanors , and other aspects of one's criminal history . Employment Verification : Assures that the job applicant 's provided employment history aligns with public records . Education Verification : Confirms the validity of the education qualifications mentioned. Credit Report : Provides insights into credit history , vital for roles involving financial responsibilities. Driving Record : Important for roles that require the operation of a motor vehicle . Social Media : Gives insights into an individual‚Äôs online behaviors and interactions. Cyber background checks add another key layer, diving deep into an individual's digital footprint, and providing additional information about their online behavior. While traditional background checks provide a view of an applicant's history, cyber checks focus on their digital lives. For freelancers and hourly workers, who often operate remotely, their online presence can provide crucial insights. For instance, internet trolls and those who have been charged for cyber offenses are not people you want to give access to your social media profiles or the back end of your website! Although cyber background checks can also let you know whether they‚Äôre active on forums related to their expertise? Which is a green flag that they‚Äôre passionate about their work. Negative reviews from previous clients online, on the other hand, can alert you to poor-quality work. And their digital footprint might also reveal potential red flags, like association with questionable online groups or engagement in unprofessional online behavior. Given that many freelancers rely heavily on online platforms for their work, understanding their digital reputation is key. How Long Do Background Checks Take? When expanding your team to cover a busy period or to complete a project, time is of the essence. This is why you often hear companies asking screening services and hiring companies, how long do background checks take? Well, this all depends on the level of screening required. For some roles such as customer service agents, personal assistants, copywriters and designers, the level of screening can be minimal, as they won‚Äôt necessarily need access to business accounts, databases, websites, social media profiles or corporate emails. However, when hiring for website developers, website designers, marketing managers, social media assistants, sales assistants etc, thorough background checks will need to take place. The higher the risk to your company, the more time is required to check the individual you wish to hire. Compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and EEOC While you could attempt to crawl the internet to verify an hourly employee yourself, companies must ensure that their background screening is FCRA compliant , adhering to the guidelines set by the Fair Credit Reporting Act . Additionally, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) emphasizes not discriminating against job applicants based on the results unless it directly affects the job. This includes considerations related to disabilities or other protected categories. This is why it‚Äôs often best to use screening services that abide by federal and state laws . Fail To Verify - What Could Go Wrong Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt carry out cyber background checks and instead hire ‚Äòblind‚Äô so to speak. What could go wrong? Well, skipping background checks , especially cyber ones, can lead to various issues: Misrepresentation: The freelancer you hire may not have the skills they claim to have, leading to subpar work quality. This can cost your company precious time and put your reputation on the line. Security breaches: Without proper checks, you risk hiring someone with malicious intentions, possibly leading to data theft or other cyber issues. If you handle sensitive customer information, this can quickly escalate into a more serious issue and a data leak, could mean facing legal action. Professional misconduct: They might not uphold professional standards, affecting team dynamics or client relationships. Hiring without carrying out the necessary record checks could even trigger a low employee retention rate, as existing employees lose trust in your company. Special Considerations for Different Industries Industries like healthcare, finance, or even childcare need a more intensive screening process. In finance, ensuring an employee doesn't have a problematic credit history can be crucial. For those in healthcare or childcare, checks against abuse registries or drug background checks might be non-negotiable. Similarly, in tech, verifying someone's coding skills and their contributions to online forums can be invaluable. Each industry has unique challenges, and tailoring background checks to meet these specific needs ensures a safe and competent hire. The Significance of Drug Background Checks Beyond the potential workplace inefficiencies or accidents caused by substance abuse, there's also the reputational risk to consider. Especially for customer-facing roles, or those in trusted positions, the actions of a single employee can have lasting ramifications on a company's image. Drug background checks act as a preventative measure, ensuring that those representing a company are doing so without the influence of judgment-impairing substances. This isn't just about protecting company assets or ensuring productivity‚Äîit's about maintaining the trust and confidence of customers and stakeholders. People Also Ask Now let‚Äôs take a look at some of the most frequently asked questions related to cyber background checks . Q: What is typically in a background check ? A standard background check includes a comprehensive review of an individual's past to determine their suitability for a particular role or task. It typically includes: Criminal Records : Information about any felonies, misdemeanors , arrests, or convictions the individual might have. Employment Verification : A check to confirm that the employment history provided by the individual aligns with actual records. Education Verification : A review to ensure the educational qualifications claimed by the individual are genuine. Credit History : An overview of the individual's financial history, giving insights into their financial responsibilities. Q: Where can I get a background check in Texas? In Texas, there are multiple avenues to obtain a background check . You can approach state agencies such as the Texas Department of Public Safety. Additionally, online platforms like Checkr offer thorough background check services. It's crucial to ensure that whichever service you opt for, it provides a combination of both traditional and cyber background evaluations for a comprehensive overview. Q: What is the best online background check ? Numerous online platforms offer background check services, but the \"best\" often depends on specific individual or business needs. Some renowned platforms include Checkr, BeenVerified, and TruthFinder, as mentioned in lists by reputable sources like Investopedia. It's essential to choose a service that offers a holistic assessment, including both traditional background checks and cyber screening services . Q: How do I get a background check in the US? In the US, individuals or businesses can request a background check through both federal and state agencies. The FBI , for instance, provides nationwide checks. Moreover, there are multiple online services that offer comprehensive checks tailored to various needs. For those specifically interested in cyber background checks , it's advised to opt for specialized online platforms that cater to this niche.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 11/07/23 7 Reasons your employee referral program is failing and how to fix it Share this article Employee referral programs are a powerful tool in the arsenal of modern recruitment strategies. They leverage your existing workforce's networks to bring in top-notch talent. However, the success of such programs is not guaranteed. Several factors can hinder their effectiveness. What is an employee referral? Before jumping into specific tips for improving your referral program, let‚Äôs level set on how we define what is an employee referral. An employee referral when current employees recommend potential candidates for a job opening within your organization. These referrals can be informal, like through a simple text message, a part of a formal referral program. Employee referrals often lead to successful hires, as employees are likely to refer individuals they believe would be a good fit for the role, promoting a sense of trust and camaraderie within the workforce. Now let's take a look at ¬†why your employee referral program might be underperforming, and explore strategies to overcome these challenges. Uninteresting Incentives Asking employees to refer a friend or family member may seem like a small request, but their reputation is on the line. If their referral doesn't get hired or is not qualified, it could pose a problem for them. The best way to overcome this is to offer adequate incentives for successful referrals. Potential Solutions - Conduct a survey among your employees to gauge their satisfaction with the current incentives. - Offer a range of incentive options, such as an extra day off, a gift card, or even a charitable donation in their name. - Review the survey data and adjust your incentives to align better with what motivates your employees. Effective incentives motivate employees to actively participate in the referral program and bring in high-quality candidates. Overcomplexity You may have appealing incentives, but if your program is overly complex, it may discourage employee participation. Complicated processes, lengthy forms, and excessive documentation requirements can be major turn-offs. Potential Solutions - Streamline the referral process by reducing the number of steps and questions. - Implement automated tools and systems to minimize manual data entry. - Ensure that the program is mobile-friendly, allowing employees to refer candidates with ease. Simplifying the process makes it more accessible and user-friendly, encouraging more employees to engage in the program. Underpromotion Even if you initially made a significant effort to promote your referral program, it's easy to let it fade into the background over time. Lack of ongoing promotion can result in reduced employee awareness and participation. Potential Solutions - Promote your referral program consistently and across various communication channels. This can include regular mentions in the company newsletter, adding it to your email signatures, or displaying physical signs around the office. - Include information about the referral program in job descriptions to attract potential candidates. - Reinforce the program during the onboarding process to ensure that new hires are aware of its existence and benefits. Continuous and widespread promotion keeps the employee referral program top-of-mind for your team. It's Stale Effective referral programs are dynamic initiatives. If ignored or left on autopilot, they will lose inertia. Regular updates and revisions are necessary to keep them fresh and effective. Potential Solutions - Schedule periodic reviews of your program to identify areas for improvement. - Solicit feedback from employees about their experiences with the program and their suggestions for enhancements. - Implement changes based on feedback and evolving company needs. A dynamic referral program that evolves with your organization will continue to deliver results over time. Lack of Recognition Employees thrive on recognition and appreciation for their efforts. If your referral program doesn't acknowledge and reward employees for their contributions, it can lead to decreased enthusiasm. Potential Solutions - Implement a recognition and rewards system that publicly acknowledges employees who make successful referrals. - Consider creating a leaderboard or recognition wall to showcase top referrers. - Host regular recognition events or ceremonies to celebrate employees' contributions. Recognizing and rewarding employees for their referrals not only motivates them but also reinforces a culture of employee engagement. Misalignment with Company Culture If your referral program doesn't align with your company's culture and values, employees may be less inclined to participate. It's essential to ensure that the program reflects your organization's mission and vision. Potential Solutions - Review your program's messaging and branding to ensure alignment with your company's culture. - Highlight how employee referrals contribute to the company's growth and success during program promotion. - Encourage employees to share their positive experiences within the company as part of the referral process. Aligning the program with your culture not only boosts participation but also reinforces your company's identity. Lack of Tracking and Feedback Without proper tracking and feedback mechanisms, you may not have a clear picture of your program's performance. This can hinder your ability to make data-driven improvements. Potential Solutions - Implement a robust tracking system to monitor the entire referral process, from initial referral to hire. - Collect feedback from employees and candidates about their experiences with the program. - Analyze the data to identify bottlenecks, areas for improvement, and successful strategies. Regularly tracking and reviewing program data allows you to make informed decisions and continuously enhance your employee referral program. In conclusion, employee referral programs are a valuable asset in the quest to attract and retain top talent. However, they require careful planning, execution, and ongoing optimization to be truly effective. By addressing these issues and implementing suggested fixes, you can breathe new life into your employee referral program and harness the power of your workforce's networks to bring in exceptional talent. Remember that a well-executed referral program not only reduces hiring costs but also fosters employee engagement and strengthens your organization's competitive edge in the job market. Take action to revitalize your referral program and watch your talent pipeline flourish.

In fact, only 54% of QSR employees reach 90 days on the job before quitting. This high turnover isn‚Äôt just disruptive. It threatens morale, hurts profitability, and impedes your ability to deliver top-notch customer service. Plus, replacing and training employees is spendy‚Äîresearch suggests it can cost $6K per individual . There are many factors that influence how much turnover costs‚Äîbut what really matters is what it‚Äôs costing you . We can help! Our free turnover calculator helps you consider the tangible costs + hidden costs of turnover and get a better feel for the financial impact turnover is having on your business today. The hidden costs of turnover A lot of turnover costs are obvious, and they can really add up. Let‚Äôs look at a quick example. Let‚Äôs say you own a 30-person store. Your HR software costs $5,000 annually. The time your manager spends on admin tasks each year equates to $37,500 of their salary. The average cost to replace an employee is $6,000. Considering the hypothetical scenario above,¬† at an average turnover rate of 80%, it would cost you $186k a year to keep your store staffed. That‚Äôs just the tangible dollars and cents. There are also many not-so-obvious costs to consider as well that will hurt your bottom line indirectly. Team morale Team morale is one of the most significant hidden costs of turnover. Losing a teammate can raise questions for the remaining workers. Are there better jobs out there? Can I get paid more elsewhere? Why did they leave? When turnover is high, employees won‚Äôt see the workplace as a more permanent place where they can potentially grow their careers. They‚Äôll start to stick one foot out the door. When people aren‚Äôt committed to their workplace, morale lowers. And when their friends keep quitting, they might want to quit too. Burnout When team members leave, the remaining individuals often have to take on additional hours or responsibilities to compensate. This can lead to increased workloads and stress, putting employees at risk for burnout. This is especially true in the fast-food industry, where workload is the #1 reason employees quit . Being stretched thin makes it more difficult to grant requests for time off or accommodate sick or unavailable workers, leading to frustration from your employees, decreased satisfaction, and a higher likelihood of burnout. And people will only tolerate that kind of workload for so long before they begin to look elsewhere. Company reputation Excessive turnover can affect the reputation of a business‚Äîboth internally and externally. Employees may perceive the high turnover rate as a sign of poor leadership and instability, which can lead to even more turnover. Plus, loyal customers will recognize when staffing is low or when their favorite team members aren‚Äôt around anymore, and it can make them wonder whether the establishment is being run effectively and fairly. Business disruption and productivity loss Even with the most well-oiled onboarding and training systems , new employees are simply not as productive as seasoned ones. A high turnover rate means there‚Äôs a new person on almost every shift, and when you‚Äôre always working with new team members, you can‚Äôt deliver goods and services as quickly‚Äîor as smoothly. Plus, when valuable veteran employees are constantly being tasked with training someone new, you‚Äôll never have a staff that‚Äôs fully operating at 100% productivity. Loss of clients A loss of productivity and overworked employees is just the beginning of the effects of turnover‚Äîcustomer service and experience will inevitably suffer, too. Whether it‚Äôs longer lines, dirty facilities, less cheerful interactions with customers, or a product that isn‚Äôt quality checked as thoroughly (or is wrong altogether), even your most dedicated customers may second-guess their loyalty once their experience is negatively impacted. Once customers don‚Äôt have a positive experience, they may decide to return less frequently, or not at all. Loyal customers can be the backbone of solid franchises, so the importance of keeping them shouldn‚Äôt be overlooked. Calculating turnover costs Now that you understand that turnover costs can creep into unexpected areas of your business,¬† you need a way to calculate how much it‚Äôs costing you personally. Calculating an accurate turnover cost is important for understanding your bottom line, and there‚Äôs often more to it than meets the eye.

Strategies for reducing turnover Once you understand how much turnover is costing you, your next question will inevitably be, ‚ÄúHow can I lower the cost?‚Äù The good news is there are several strategies you can employ to accomplish this. Ensure fair compensation Hourly workers can tell you there is often a significant divide between minimum wage and living wage. Offering a competitive compensation package can speak volumes about how much you value your workers and in turn, boost their loyalty to you and the company. In the end, a job is a job, and employees need to feel like they‚Äôre making enough to return to work each day. Clear opportunities for growth and professional development plans can also help reduce turnover rates. Not sure how much to pay your workers? Compare wages across roles and locations with our Hourly Wage Index . Foster a positive work environment Nurturing a positive work culture is key to keeping employees engaged and satisfied with their job. Emphasize ongoing communication and feedback channels to continually address employee concerns so workers feel seen and understood, prioritize fair hours and a balanced workload, and recognize when your employees are doing a good job so they feel appreciated. Enhance employee engagement Speaking of feeling appreciated, recognition programs can help employees feel valued. Team-building activities are another great way to help employees feel invested in each other‚Äôs success and make positive memories, boosting synergy and satisfaction overall. Whether this means treats in the backroom or first dibs on schedule requests, get creative to implement something that helps your team feel appreciated and engaged. Provide opportunities for growth There‚Äôs a common misconception that hourly workers aren‚Äôt interested in building careers; they‚Äôre here for a short time. And while that may be true for some, a surprising amount of this workforce is looking for opportunities to build a career and climb the ladder. In fact, 41% of employees quit their previous jobs due to a lack of career advancement. Creating clear growth opportunities (and communicating them often) can give hourly workers a reason to stay. This can mean development planning for each employee, mentorship programs, or continuous learning opportunities through trainings. Improve recruitment and onboarding Boosting retention can be as simple as finding the right team members in the first place. Setting clear expectations can ensure you‚Äôre attracting workers who are a solid fit for the role and company culture. Once hired, individuals need to feel supported and engaged from the beginning through a strategic and effective onboarding program. One study showed that a well-executed onboarding program can boost retention by a whopping 82%. Measure your retention efforts Last but certainly not least, you need to implement a way to measure your retention situation. Are there specific positions or locations struggling more than others? Are there any patterns revealing how long employees tend to stay? Dive into the data to assess your current situation, then create a game plan for how to address your business‚Äô unique turnover challenges. Take steps today to secure your team‚Äôs future Turnover rates may seem overwhelming, especially when confronting all of the hidden costs and implications for the business, but there are many ways to take action so your team members feel valued, heard, and dedicated to your business's long-term success. Our calculator is a great first step in creating an action plan. Share it with your managers and keep it handy so you always have the most up-to-date figures to drive your retention strategy. By taking proactive steps now to address turnover rates, you‚Äôll not only boost morale, but you‚Äôll lay the foundation for sustained growth and profitability in the competitive franchise landscape.

Not even the pandemic slowed down its expansion, opening 50 or more restaurants a year in the past four years, and poised to reach 1,000 locations by 2025 . Its consistent growth despite some very tough challenges like a labor shortage and supply chain issues is impressive to say the least. So, what‚Äôs their secret? Strategic hiring At the heart of Culver's success lies its unwavering commitment to strategic hiring. As the chain expands into new markets and territories, finding the right talent to staff these new locations becomes paramount. The company does this in two interesting ways: First, it requires prospective franchisees to immerse themselves in the Culver's experience by working in one of its restaurants for six 10-hour days. This ensures every new franchisee embodies the company‚Äôs values and ethos and knows how to build a team that does the same. Culver's 101 directly influences the hiring process because franchisees see first-hand the skills and characteristics that make a successful Culver‚Äôs employee. They can then set strict qualifications and use diverse sourcing strategies to attract and hire the right applicants. And to find the right hires, Culver‚Äôs invests in smart technology. Since selecting Workstream as its corporate preferred hiring partner , three out of every four restaurants now use the platform to efficiently source, screen, schedule, and interview applicants. Franchisees are able to staff locations quickly thanks to Workstream‚Äôs automation and mobile-first functionality that keeps applicants engaged and moving through the hiring process quickly. Empowering employees The focus on people doesn‚Äôt end with hiring. Culver‚Äôs has a strong culture of investing in its employees and making them a key part of how they win. We all know that career advancement, mentorship, and a fun work environment are among the top reasons hourly workers stay at their jobs . Culver‚Äôs addresses all this and more with its unique retention programs: The Franchisee Mentorship Program partners restaurant managers with franchisees looking to expand so they can learn the ropes. The Culver‚Äôs Foundation‚Ñ¢ is a scholarship program that invests in team member education and has awarded scholarships to over 3,000 employees. Restaurants compete annually in the Culver‚Äôs Crew Challenge , where they‚Äôre judged on quality, service, cleanliness, hospitality, community outreach, and training and development. The winner receives a $100,000 prize. From frontline crew members to seasoned franchisees, Culver's fosters a culture of collaboration, growth, and innovation, ensuring that every member of its team has the tools and support they need to thrive. Quality, quality, quality It‚Äôs easy to let quality slip as you expand, especially when you‚Äôre growing quickly. We‚Äôve all seen it happen before. But that‚Äôs not the case with Culver‚Äôs. The company is still family-owned and picky about where it expands to and who can become a franchise owner. The company has used fresh, never-frozen beef since its founding in 1984. From sourcing local, fresh ingredients (even down to its cheese curds) to making everything to order, the original food philosophy of Culver‚Äôs hasn't changed since its inception. This also presents itself in the brand‚Äôs restaurant atmosphere. Founded in Sauk City, Wisconsin, Culver‚Äôs restaurants have a midwestern charm and brand of hospitality that can only come from the Cheese State. Regardless of where a Culver‚Äôs is located, you‚Äôll receive the same warm welcome when you walk in the door and pleasant chit-chat with employees as you order. Building a strong foundation Maintaining these food and hospitality traditions is so important to Culver‚Äôs success, which is why hiring and retention are critical. Finding the right staff that embodies these values and commitment to quality and keeping them with the Culver‚Äôs family, has made it easier to grow the business so quickly. With a projected expansion of 51 stores in 2024 and a strong focus on enhancing the customer experience, Culver's is poised to continue its upward trajectory and solidify its position as a leader in the fast-food industry. Through strategic hiring practices, employee empowerment, and a relentless dedication to quality, Culver's is paving the way for an exciting future.

We‚Äôre pretty sure that you, your friends , and just about everyone you know have used a third-party delivery service at least once in the past year. According to recent data , 185 million people are expected to use online food delivery services by 2025. And 71% of millennials reported that they‚Äôre now more likely to get their food delivered than before the pandemic ! Of course, that‚Äôs not surprising, is it? Especially since third-party food delivery apps like Uber Eats make it incredibly convenient for customers to find new restaurants, check reviews, and get food delivered right to their door. BUT‚Ä¶ does that mean your restaurant should rely on them to deliver food to your customers? Maybe... Maybe not. That‚Äôs why, in this article, we want to help you decide whether your own delivery is all you need or if you should also consider third-party delivery companies for your restaurant. With that goal in mind, we‚Äôll be discussing: Information on three of the most popular delivery apps , including the fees they charge restaurants and delivery costs . The pros and cons of using third-party delivery services , including considerations for delivery staff and delivery time . How to get your restaurant on third-party delivery apps How to create an in-house delivery service for your restaurant But, before we get into those topics, let‚Äôs look at some quick facts on third-party delivery services . What are third-party delivery services? Third-party delivery services are companies that list your restaurant on their food ordering app. Within the app, customers can browse multiple restaurant menus, place orders for delivery, and get their food delivered by someone working for the service as an independent contractor. Third-party delivery services are companies that list your restaurant on their food ordering app. Within the app, customers can browse multiple restaurant menus, place orders for delivery, and get their food delivered by someone working for the service as an independent contractor.¬† They manage the delivery operation , including the crucial last-mile delivery , and offer a convenient delivery model for both restaurants and customers. And, whether you like them or not, these delivery service apps are here to stay. Here are some quick facts that show why we say that: In a recent survey, 29% of consumers reported ordering online delivery at least a few times a month In another survey, 37.5% of restaurants said they wouldn‚Äôt have been able to stay in business without being on third-party delivery apps In that same survey, 28.8% of restaurants said 21-30% of their sales now come from those apps Examples of third-party delivery apps: facts, fees and features The third-party delivery service app market is extremely competitive despite the large market size. Here are some of the key facts, fees, and features from three of the most widely used food delivery apps . DoorDash With over half of the market share in the American food delivery market, DoorDash is the most popular food delivery platform in the United States. So far, they have partnered with more than 310,000 restaurants in more than 4,000 cities. In December 2020, the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange . DoorDash features a business performance tool for their restaurant partners that aims to help them grow their business and improve the customer experience . Their platform serves as a crucial link between restaurants and retailers , providing a convenient SMS notification system for order updates which improves the delivery experience . For delivery orders , DoorDash charges restaurants a 15-30% commission fee . The exact fee amount depends on the DoorDash subscription plan you choose. This real-time commission structure is part of DoorDash 's business model optimization . This process is aimed at maximizing revenue for both the company and its partner restaurants. Uber Eats As of December 2021, Uber Eats is the second largest player in the food delivery market with around 24% of the market share. Uber Eats also acquired Postmates at the end of November 2020. To date, Uber Eats has partnerships with more than 700,000 restaurants and is used in more than 500 cities worldwide. In addition to providing tools for marketing, Uber Eats supports their restaurant partners by providing POS integration and a tablet that can be used to manage online orders and deliveries. The app also offers notifications to keep both restaurants and customers updated on order status, and it facilitates e-commerce transactions seamlessly. For delivery orders , Uber Eats charges restaurants a 15-30% commission fee . As with DoorDash , the exact amount depends on the Uber Eats subscription plan you choose. GrubHub Founded in 2004, GrubHub has been one of the leading food delivery services long before the pandemic began. GrubHub also owns other food delivery subsidiaries, such as Seamless and Eat24, which contribute to their total market share that‚Äôs around 15%. Currently, GrubHub has partnered with more than 300,000 restaurants in more than 4,000 U.S. cities. On top of the standard marketing tools that help restaurants grow their delivery business, GrubHub also gives newly joined restaurants a 30-day free service promotion. Additionally, GrubHub handles outsourcing of delivery logistics, allowing restaurants to focus on their core operations. GrubHub charges restaurants a 20% marketing fee applied as a percentage of each order, a 10% delivery fee for delivery services, and a $0.30 + 3.05% processing fee. Pros and cons of third-party delivery services Before deciding whether your restaurant should partner with one or more delivery service apps, it‚Äôs important to know what to expect. Here are some of the most important pros and cons for you to know about beforehand. Pros of using third-party food delivery apps Outsourced delivery process By using third-party delivery services, you get to avoid the tedious and costly delivery process. This could save you money on payroll and liability. Since you only have to pay for the apps‚Äô service fees, you don‚Äôt have to cover the salary of a food delivery driver , which is an average of $29,845 a year according to ZipRecruiter. Moreover, leveraging third-party delivery platforms allows you to streamline your delivery operations , thereby enhancing efficiency and reliability Increased customer reach There were more than 111 million food delivery users in 2020 alone, and that number has continued to grow into the 2024s. By listing your restaurants on these platforms, you get more exposure that can be converted into sales. Your restaurant might only serve local neighborhood customers for now. However, by strategically leveraging these third-party delivery apps , you can expand your market reach beyond your local area and attract customers from neighboring communities and even tourists visiting your city. This broader customer base enhances your restaurant's visibility and revenue potential, driving growth and profitability in the long term. Time to focus on other business goals Since a huge part of your restaurant‚Äôs business gets taken care of by these apps, you also get more time to focus on your business. For example, you can use the time that would be spent managing deliveries to do other important tasks to help grow your business , like improving your restaurant's dine-in experience or digital marketing strategy. Additionally, by collaborating with couriers through third-party delivery services , you can ensure efficient and reliable delivery operations , freeing up even more time for strategic business initiatives. Cons of using third-party food delivery apps The following are some of the drawbacks of using third-party food delivery apps . High Service Fees The service fees charged by these delivery companies can be a huge expense for your business‚Äîespecially if your restaurant is already struggling amid the pandemic . Unsurprisingly, these fees tend to be among the top complaints from restaurant owners who use these third-party services. Stiff Competition While partnering with a delivery app will increase your customer reach and visibility beyond your neighborhood, it also puts you in a position to compete with hundreds of restaurants at the same time. When using these apps, customers get to compare prices, reviews, and ratings across multiple restaurants. Lack of Control Once the food is picked up from your restaurant, you have almost zero influence on or knowledge about the customer experience . If something does go wrong, it could show up in a negative customer review. A recent study from Raydiant found that 38.5% of restaurants have received negative customer reviews due to an issue with a third-party delivery app . On top of that, you might not be able to access any of your customer data from third-party delivery services to improve your business. Consumers Prefer Direct Orders In another study, 64% of adults said they‚Äôd prefer to order directly from a restaurant for delivery. This is likely because consumers using these apps also face higher fees and menu prices than they would if they were to order directly from your restaurant. How to partner with third-party delivery service apps If you‚Äôve decided the pros of third-party delivery apps outweigh the cons, here are the steps you can take to get your restaurant on one or more of them. Or, if you‚Äôd rather set up an in-house delivery service to avoid the cons of these apps, skip ahead to the next section of this article. Step 1 - Research Your Options There are quite a few third-party delivery service providers available in the market apart from the three major players we mentioned earlier. Depending on the city your restaurant is in, you might be able to list your restaurant on multiple platforms. Step 2 - Understand the Policies and Fees Each delivery partner has different policies. Make sure you read the fine print before signing the contracts, especially if there are any that request you to sign an exclusive contract. Step 3 - Create a Delivery-Focused Menu Once you have chosen the right third-party partner(s), you should review your current menu and select the items that are best suited for delivery and most likely to attract customers. Step 4 - Set Up Your System You will need an additional tablet to manage the incoming orders if the third-party app cannot be integrated with your existing Point of Sales ( POS ) system. You might even need or want to create a delivery pickup area in your restaurant for third-party delivery riders. Step 5 - Train Your Staff and Streamline the Process Your in-house staff will need to learn how to use third-party apps and manage online orders . You will also need to formulate a standard operating procedure for packaging the food for delivery. How to create an in-house delivery service for your restaurant Here‚Äôs what you need to do if you decide you‚Äôd rather process and manage deliveries without using third-party apps or in addition to using those apps. Step 1 - Get the Right Technology Look for a cost-effective online ordering software that is compatible with your POS . You should also link the ordering system to your restaurant website and mobile app (if you have one). Step 2 - Staff Your Team Of course, you‚Äôll need to hire delivery drivers to make this work. You may also need to hire more cooks if your current cooks don‚Äôt have the work capacity to handle additional online orders . To make the process of hiring these workers easier, consider using an all-in-one hiring solution like Workstream. Step 3 - Purchase Delivery Vehicles If your delivery drivers don‚Äôt already have their vehicles, you‚Äôll need to purchase some that are suitable for your operations. On top of that, you should make sure to get insurance for your drivers and vehicles. Step 4 - Train Your Delivery Drivers In addition to ensuring they have a valid license, you should train your drivers in delivery logistics and customer service. Every interaction counts for customer experience , so you should form an SOP that the drivers can reference. Make sure your drivers also know how to comply with COVID-19 safety protocols. Step 5 - Stock Up on Delivery Equipment Next, make sure you have a constant stock of takeout containers for both delivery and takeout orders. To use delivery as an opportunity for marketing and advertising, you may also want to consider creating a printout with promotions, discounts, or general information about your restaurant to include in your delivery bags. Step 6 - Let Customers Know You Deliver If delivery is a new service for your restaurant, make sure your customers know. They may assume that because you‚Äôre not listed on delivery apps you don‚Äôt deliver. So, make a special announcement about your delivery options on your website, put up a flier in your windows, and share how customers can order from you on your social media accounts. Final thoughts There are pros and cons to both third-party delivery services and in-house delivery . Deciding which option to rely on for delivery can be difficult. But we hope that the information helps make that decision a little easier!

FAQs What is the Meaning of In-House Delivery ? The term \" in-house delivery \" refers to a system where a restaurant manages its own delivery service rather than outsourcing it to third-party delivery companies . In this setup, the restaurant employs its own delivery drivers and handles the entire delivery process internally, from order fulfillment to customer doorstep delivery. What is In-Home Delivery? In-home delivery refers to the process of goods being delivered directly to a customer's residence or place of dwelling. This can include items such as groceries, packages, or prepared meals that are brought directly to the customer's doorstep or inside their home for convenience. When Is In-House Delivery Worth It? In-house delivery is worth it when a restaurant wants more control over the delivery process , ensuring quality and customer satisfaction. It's also beneficial when the restaurant can handle delivery efficiently and cost-effectively compared to third-party services. What is a Third-Party Food Delivery Service ? A third-party food delivery service is a company that facilitates food delivery from restaurants to customers using their platform or app. They connect customers with restaurants, let them browse menus, place orders, and have food delivered to their location by independent contractors. Examples include Uber Eats , DoorDash , and Grubhub . Is Uber Eats available in Richmond? Yes, Uber Eats is available in Richmond, Virginia. With Uber Eats , you can conveniently discover and order from a wide range of restaurants in Richmond for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks. Simply browse through the app, select your desired food options, and track your order in real time as it gets delivered to you. What is the Difference Between 3PL & 4PL Service Providers ? The main difference between 3PL and 4PL service providers lies in their level of involvement and scope of services. A 3PL, or third-party logistics provider, primarily handles logistics operations such as transportation, warehousing, and distribution on behalf of a company. On the other hand, a 4PL, or fourth-party logistics provider, typically takes on a more comprehensive role by managing and optimizing the entire supply chain, including overseeing multiple 3PLs and integrating various logistics functions. In simpler terms, while a 3PL focuses on specific logistics tasks, a 4PL offers broader supply chain management solutions.

And due to how much the ongoing pandemic has changed where and how people eat, online ordering is essential for any restaurant that wants to survive. But what‚Äôs the best way to do it? Should you put all your faith in third-party delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash? Or is it best to set up an in-house online ordering system for your restaurant? In this blog post, we‚Äôll help you answer those questions by looking at: Some recent survey data showing the importance of online ordering for restaurants in 2022 What things to consider before setting up your ordering system How to set up an online ordering system for your restaurant (without relying exclusively on third-party delivery services) 5 qualities of the best online ordering systems for restaurants Why is online ordering important for restaurants? There are many reasons why online ordering is important for restaurants. Let‚Äôs look at a few stats that demonstrate what we mean. Great way to reach more customers. In a 2021 survey, 53% of consumers consider takeout and delivery to be essential to their way of life. ( National Restaurant Association ) Preferred way for customers to place orders. 67% of consumers prefer using a restaurant‚Äôs website or app for food delivery instead of third-party apps. ( Square ) Online orders tend to increase sales. Restaurants have reported that online orders are 20% larger than orders placed over the phone. ( ChowNow ) And, although there currently isn‚Äôt data to support it, we‚Äôre sure you can imagine a few other benefits of online ordering. For example, it can help increase customer loyalty since customers can create accounts with your restaurant's online ordering system. This allows them to save their favorite orders and track past orders. Additionally, online ordering systems frees up time that your staff would otherwise spend taking orders in person or over the phone. Those benefits sound great, right? Well, before you decide to get started with taking online orders, start by making sure you‚Äôve thought everything through. Factors to consider before setting up an online ordering system for your restaurant Before setting up an online ordering system, make sure you‚Äôve considered the following things so that you do it in a way that best benefits your restaurant and your customers. Third party-app delivery or in-house delivery Can customers place orders directly on your restaurant‚Äôs website? Or will they have to go through a third-party delivery service app? There are pros and cons to each option. Some of the key benefits of using a third-party delivery service app like GrubHub include that they're often easier for customers to use and they take care of payment processing for you. But that also means that you get less control over the customer experience and keep less profit. That being said, if your restaurant‚Äôs website or app isn't designed to handle online orders or isn‚Äôt user-friendly, customers may get frustrated and leave your site without ordering. In that case, you're better off leaving it to the apps and taking a look at this post on third-party delivery service apps instead! Online ordering software If you decide you want to process orders on your restaurant‚Äôs website, then you need to decide which software you want to use. There are many different types of online ordering software available, so it's important to find one that fits the needs of your business. If you need help deciding, check out this post from Bentobox on 8 of the best online ordering systems for restaurants. Customer details One of the advantages of having an online ordering system is that it makes it easy to collect customer data. And you can use that data to support your restaurant marketing and branding. So, decide how much information you want customers to share before they place an order. Do you want them to create an account? Will they need to enter their contact information each time? Do you want them to sign up for a loyalty program ? Delivery charges Another thing you'll need to decide is how much you're going to charge for delivery. Many restaurants offer free delivery for orders over a certain amount. But you'll need to make sure that the amount is high enough that it's worth it for you and your customers. How to set up an online ordering system for your restaurant Online ordering is a great way for you to increase your restaurant‚Äôs sales and improve customer satisfaction. And by following these steps, you can set up your own online ordering system and start benefiting from all of the advantages that it has to offer. Step 1 - Choose your software As we mentioned in the previous section, there are many online ordering software for you to choose from. Take some time to go through the features of each one to find the one that best suits your needs. Ideally, you‚Äôll choose one that has all of the features we share in the next section of this blog post. Step 2 - Set up your menu Next, you‚Äôll need to upload your menu onto your ordering system. But, before you do, you need to consider whether you‚Äôd like to include all of your menu items or a select few. For example, you may decide to exclude menu items that are difficult to package well into your delivery containers. For the menu items you do list, be sure to also add pictures and any additional information that you think could be of interest to your customers. Step 3 - Add an online ordering button to your website Make sure customers know where and how to make online orders whenever they visit your website. To do that, place a button that says something like ‚ÄúOrder Now‚Äù at the top of your website. If you‚Äôre unsure of how to add this feature to your site, then you may need to consult with a web developer. Also, test out the ordering system yourself before launching to make sure everything works smoothly. Step 4 - Promote your new online ordering system Adding a button to your website isn‚Äôt enough. You have to let customers know about your new online ordering platform wherever you can. Promote it on your in-house menus, social media pages, email signatures, flyers and any other marketing materials. 5 qualities of the best online ordering systems for restaurants When researching the software options for your online ordering system, we recommend choosing one that has the following qualities. User-friendly interface You want an online ordering system that is easy for your customers to navigate. The layout should be straightforward, with clear buttons and labels. Your customers should be able to find what they are looking for quickly and easily. Customizable menus Your menu should be customizable so that you can showcase your best dishes and drinks. You should also be able to tailor the menu for different occasions, like Happy Hour and festive holiday menus. Integrated payment system Your online ordering system should have an integrated payment system so that customers can pay for their orders with ease. This will avoid any confusion at checkout and make the process smoother for your customers. Order tracking and history You want an online ordering system that allows you to track orders and view past transactions. This will help you keep tabs on what items are popular with your customers. POS integration You also want to choose an online ordering system that integrates into the Point-of-Sales system you‚Äôre already using. This will make managing orders and becoming proficient in the new software easy for you and your staff. Final thoughts Online ordering systems are becoming more popular every day, so your restaurant should offer this service if you want to stay competitive. By following the key considerations and steps we‚Äôve shared in this post, you can create an online ordering system that works best for your business!

I founded my first business after high school, a restaurant, to pay for college. It was exciting, fun but extremely tired. I was in the restaurant by 6am in the morning to prepare, and would often stay till 10pm at night washing dishes; because I was consistently short-staffed and needed to hire new people, and to manage and execute operations on my own. Hiring for the best talent is always the top thing for any business, but for a restaurant it was even more critical to source, recruit and hire the top talent due to the high turnover of the industry. In early 2018, I started Workstream together with my co-founders, Lei Xu and Max Wang , to solve this problem, and to help local businesses and restaurants to hire hourly workers faster and better with text recruiting tools. At the time, I was an eager recent graduate from Harvard and MIT, and recently moved out to San Francisco Bay Area. I was hungry to make an impact and wanted to work on a mission-driven idea. I started by talking to many local business areas around Palo Alto, where I was staying at. I would walk into many restaurants, cafes and shops in downtown Palo Alto from Coupa Cafe (who would end up being our first customer!), Jamba Juice, Blue Bottle and conduct surveys with business owners, general managers and servers. I walked into shops with a bright smile, introducing myself as a \"student\" and shared that I'm working on a project and wanted to get their feedback. I was turned away many times, but there were many people who were kind enough to set aside time for me. From the hundreds of conversations I was lucky to have with these operators who gave me with the time of their day, I re-learned the challenges and difficulties of running a local business and restaurant. The top two challenges of any local business owner were (1) recruiting good talent that stays (2) growing the business. I knew it was a massive problem, with over hundreds of thousands of restaurants and millions of local businesses in America alone, but many of them were struggling - good hourly workers were difficult to find, engaging them and hiring them was difficult, and there was no good tool these operators could use. I knew it was a very challenging and meaningful problem that I wanted to solve. I knew that through helping local businesses, we could impact and help millions of hourly workers whose recruiting process could be streamlined. It was a mission I knew I could dedicate the next few decades of my life on - it was a massive and meaningful problem that hasn't been solved and I wanted to make a difference and impact. It was a mission I knew I could dedicate the next few decades of my life on. Our First Ten Customers Over the next year, my co-founders and I started to assemble similar mission-driven teammates, and started to work on building a product that was impactful and meaningful. I could still re-call our first customer, Coupa Cafe in Palo Alto which has 10 locations in the San Francisco Bay Area. We worked closely with them and they provided us with a lot of relevant feedback, and when they hired their first person via Workstream on the third day of using our product (the usual time to hire is 14 days), we knew we had something special. I will always remember the first ten customers of Workstream, who took a chance on a small team to work with us, provide us with product feedback and to help us to grow. One of our first customer was Steven (photo below), who owned over 16 locations of Jamba Juice in the San Francisco Bay Area, including the one at Stanford University. I will always remember the day when my co-founders and me sat next to Steven at Stanford University and pitched our \"wireframes\" to Steven. Based on the mock-ups, Steven told us he will pay us if we can finish building in the next 2 weeks. After that meeting, my co-founders and me locked ourselves up in our studio apartment in San Francisco, stocked up on ramen and pizza, to product the first beta version of Workstream, and showed it to Steven. To our disbelief, he was impressed enough to pay us! Another one of our early customer was Jaron Hall , Founder of Utah Maids. I was on my first trip to Utah in early 2018 with my family to visit the nature and go on some hikes, and guess what I did - I cold emailed hundreds of local business owners to ask for a meeting and learn from them. Jaron was one of the kind souls who offered to meet me. As soon as I landed in Utah, I drove to Utah and pitched our first version of Workstream to Utah. Luckily, he seemed impressed enough to say he was open to try us out. Long story short, Utah Maids has been a happy customer of Workstream since 2018, and after selling Utah Maids in 2019, Jaron joined us as our first business hire, and has contributed to our strong growth till now. Another special customer to me was Tara and Jason (photo below), who are franchisees of Pieology, Jamba Juice and Carl's Jr. Tara is a forward-thinking entrepreneur who is at the cutting edge of marketing, technology and franchising. From the first call we had, she was clearly asking relevant questions about how to streamline the applicant sourcing and hiring process, and provided many invaluable inputs for us on how to better help restaurant operators like herself. Three months into working with us, Tara was so impressed by Workstream she sent an email to every single Jamba Juice franchisee in the country detailing a 2 pager review of her experience with Workstream, recommending us. I will always be humbled and thankful for Tara's generosity and innovative thinking. (Plug: Tara is currently providing marketing consulting services, so please ping her if of interest. She's amazing!) Over the next few weeks and months, we continued to work on product development, and as Paul Graham always says, \"Doing things that don't scale\", talking 1 on 1 with customers, spending them at the back office of restaurants and local businesses, and learning about the deep pain of hiring, recruiting and onboarding that restaurant operators face daily. We learned at a rapid pace, and was excited at the opportunity to make impact to many of their entrepreneurs and main street operators, who were empowering the economy of America. At the same time, we started to get feedback from our customers daily, and we rapidly realized we were solving a real problem that many people cared about when we started receiving feedback from our customers (like below). Fast forward to 2020, we work with hundreds of restaurants, franchisees and local businesses from Chick-fil-A, Jimmy John's, McDonald's, Applebee's, Market Street Grill, Seven Peaks, Panera Bread, Dunkin', Sonic Drive-In, Marriott, Westin, Sports Basement, Grocery Outlet and more. I was also lucky enough to assemble a team including my co-founder and Chief Product Officer, Lei Xu (Google, Y Combinator, UC Berkley), co-founder and CTO, Max Wang (Cornell computer science), Head of Sales, Blake Harber (Lucid, HireVue), Head of Customer Success, Aaron Delgadillo (University of San Francisco), Internal Operations Lead, Kerri Kohli , and an initial small team of passionate streamers to join us in this journey. (yes, we are hiring! please feel free to ping any of us) As our team grew, we needed to make changes daily and weekly, to expand the team, and to build more product. Our team grew rapidly, and we now have two main hubs in the country in San Francisco and Utah, and with many remote streamers in Texas, Washington DC, Vermont, Singapore, and more. At the same time, we continue to learn new things daily from our customers and restaurants, and I continue to be thankful that I'm able to embark on this mission to help restaurants and local businesses. We Are Thankful To Be Able To Help Restaurants During COVID In April 2020, covid hit restaurants and local businesses, and devastated the local business industry. Many restaurants were impacted and needed to close down or re-think how they do business. Many Workstream customers were impacted and we quickly re-grouped to think about how we can be helpful towards our customers. We knew that the livelihood of many our partners were impacted and we wanted to make a difference. We immediately started to reach out to every impacted Workstream customer, doing 1 on 1 with them, offering them assistance and help in any way that we can. At the same time, we created content, including free e-books like this covid guide book to re-opening and re-hiring, and started to hold weekly webinars . In our conversations with our customers, we found that Workstream was more important and helpful for them than ever before throughout covid. They needed a way to source, hire and onboard talent safely and quicker, via texting and video, in a contactless manner and way. We were thankful we had the opportunity to help them, and started to work closely to double down on our customer success team to help them (kudos to Mary , Benjamin and Tiny ). In our customer calls, we saw a wide range of emotions, from fear, cries, to tears of joy when we were able to help a local franchisee in Indiana re-open and re-hire within days as she needed to start her business to provide for her family. In our customer calls during covid, we saw a wide range of emotions, from fear, cries, to tears of joy when we were able to help a local franchisee in Indiana reopen and re-hire within days as she needed to start her business to provide for her family. Another Workstream customer we spoke to Amir Hosseini of Curry Up Now. He was opening up restaurants throughout the country in Salt Lake City, Austin, New Jersey and more throughout covid, and needed a way to be able to communicate with both potential candidates and employees, and to drive recruiting forward in a contactless and safe way. We worked closely with Amir to come up with a 30-60-90 day plan to implement text recruiting for all of his 50 over locations throughout the country, and we were able to help them to provide food and resources to their customers, and to also help hundreds of people get employed safely and quickly. Today, we are still battling covid and helping our customers daily to be able to more efficiently use technology to reopen and to re-hire, and to safely and quickly hire the right talent needed for their businesses. However, throughout the thousands of customer calls our team had performed in past few months, we saw a lot of optimism and hope. We are optimistic that restaurant and local business operators, some of the most strong-willed and most tenacious entrepreneurs I have ever met, will be able to steer forward and overcome the current situation. Raising Our $10 Million Round We never had the need to raise funding as we were a frugal and scrappy team , and were growing rapidly. However, we had many customers started to reach out to us, sharing that they wanted to invest in us as they believed in what we were doing, from local franchisees from Halal Guys, Chick-fil-A, to corporate ventures arms of some of our larger customers. We finally decided that we wanted to raise and I reached out to one of my mentors, Eric Yuan, CEO of Zoom. Within minutes of me sharing what we were doing, Eric decided to invest and started to share with me his journey of how he started Zoom after Webex, and how he struggled early on to raise funding and provided me with a lot of guidance and advice. At the same time, I was introduced to Keith Rabois of Founders Fund. As part of the PayPal mafia, Keith was formerly COO of Square, co-founder of Opendoor, and on the board of Yelp. He is also an early investor in Stripe, Affirm, AirBnb, DoorDash, Wish (about every company that is going public this year!) We knew we could not pass up on the chance to learn from him, and within days of our first meeting, a term sheet was signed and we have been fortunate to learn from him since. I first Joe Montana via my Harvard classmate, Michael Ma (who is one of the best investors in Silicon Valley), and the first thing that Joe did when he met me was to open the door for me (!!), and to get me a glass of water. I was immediately touched by Joe Montana's humbleness, and in our conversation, was inspired by his journey from San Francisco 49ers superstar quarter to a venture capitalist who has invested in hundreds of top companies from Gitlab, Rippling, and more, and is really only getting started. I was immediately touched by Joe Montana's humbleness, and in our conversation, was inspired by his journey from San Francisco 49ers superstar quarter to a venture capitalist In the same week, I was introduced to Tony Xu, CEO of DoorDash via an investor. I was immediately impressed by Tony as in our first meeting. He was waiting for me by the receptionist, early by a few minutes, patiently waiting for me, before he brought me to a small conference room where we started to have a conversation around how we were both trying to help restaurants, create impact and share a common mission. I was humbled by the opportunity to meet and learn from him, and he has been most generous with his time since we met. As part of our $10 million series A , we were fortunate to raise from investors including Anna Khan of Charles River Ventures, Lan Xuezhao of Basis Set Ventures, Max Levchin (former CTO PayPal, CEO and co-founder, Affirm), former COO of Yelp, COO Okta, CEO of Intercom, James Harden of Houston Rockets, Owner of Sacramento Kings and Soma Capital, Justin Kan (Founder of Twitch), Peterson Ventures in Utah, Bernard Arnault (Chairman of LVMH) GGV Capital, CEO Patreon, CEO Logitech, ex-Googler fund, Holly Liu (former Partner at Y Combinator), CEO Lattice, and many more other local franchisee owners, operators and angel investors. Sharing Our Journey Till Now I wanted to share my journey thoroughly because every step of it was challenging, difficult but also incredibly rewarding. It was painful. But that is the way that starting a business is. I first started my first business after high school to pay for college, and have started 5 other businesses before Workstream; each time it was painful and rewarding, but never have I felt as motivated and thankful to be able to work on a mission that can impact over 60% of the American and global economy (80% of workers in world are hourly workers and 65% of workers in US are hourly workers). At the same time, I wanted to share my story as I read about restaurants closing down or shutting down during covid, and the many challenges they face and meet daily. When I jump on a call with my partners and restaurant owners, I see my own parents in them, the perfect reflection of grit and determination as they push on daily, despite any challenge that they need. I hope to be able to share our story of how restaurants and local businesses during covid are suffering, but will never back down. I am very fortunate and lucky to be able to be on this journey together with fellow streamers to help restaurants and other local businesses as we move forward in one of the most challenging time of the decade and possibly in our lifetime, but I wanted to share my story in the hope that it will motivate restaurants, entrepreneurs and people to keep going, heads up and don't give up. To be a bit cliche, \"When it is at is darkest, is when light will appear at the end of the tunnel\". To be a bit cliche, \"When it is at its darkest, its when light will appear at the end of the tunnel\". What the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve. Onwards.

You‚Äôve got a bustling environment, hungry customers, and a busy team to manage. Onboarding new employees is a crucial part of your success story. When done right, it helps complete required paperwork quickly and keeps new hires engaged through the orientation and training phases, setting them up for success from day one. But let‚Äôs be real‚Äînot all onboarding processes are created equal. There‚Äôs the old-school method with piles of paper documents and endless, time-consuming tasks that make the first week at work super confusing (and possibly disappointing) for new hires. And then there‚Äôs digital onboarding , which uses cloud technology to get your crew up and running without stress and headaches, making the whole process smoother and saving you precious time and money. Traditional vs. digital onboarding Let's look at the difference between traditional and digital onboarding. Traditional onboarding Forms are time-consuming to fill out by hand, and new hires often have to write the same information over and over. Documents contain sensitive personal data‚Äîlike social security numbers and bank account details‚Äîthat are tough to keep secure in paper format. Printing costs for onboarding forms, training documents, and welcome packets add up quickly. Archiving paper documents in time-consuming. If you're not careful, these documents can get lost, misplaced, or even stolen. You can outsource additional authentication measures, like identify verification, but that can slow down the onboarding process. Digital onboarding Keeps sensitive personal data secure. Uses automated tools that guide users through the process with ease. Reduces costs by eliminating the need for printed materials. Tracks each worker's progress in real-time and sends notifications for pending tasks. Uses advanced certification tools, like biometric authentication measures and easy-to-use electronic signatures for each identity document. Customizes each employee profile with the appropriate documents and training materials. 3 ways digital onboarding helps your QSR's bottom line 1. It saves costs Implementing digital onboarding at your QSR will be a complete 180 for your business. It saves time, money, and headaches by: Setting up automated workflows and tasks, like moving employees to the next step in the onboarding process, sending reminders to complete paperwork, and notifying managers of any pending issues. Reducing errors caused by paperwork. Cutting printing costs. Eliminating redundant tasks and the need to wait for verifications. 2. It improves worker retention Nothing ruins the enthusiasm of a new job like a first week filled with redundant paperwork, disorganized training, and idle time. Getting onboarding right helps new workers feel valued and supported from the start, increasing their likelihood of staying with your company long-term and saving on hiring and training costs. 3. It integrates with other digital tools A digital onboarding platform can integrate with other HR tools used for recruiting, payroll , and training. This way, you can synchronize data between applications and ensure consistency and accuracy across platforms. Digital onboarding and QSR operations: A perfect fit The benefits of digital onboarding apply to businesses in any sector, but if there‚Äôs a type of operation where digital onboarding is a particularly good fit, it‚Äôs quick-service restaurants. Here are some specific advantages: 1. It moves things forward quickly QSR operations are fast-paced and tend to have higher turnover than other businesses. In fact, according to industry research, only 54 percent of quick-service employees reach 90 days of working before quitting. With digital onboarding, you can get new hires up and running quicky. 2. It's mobile-friendly Using a digital platform makes onboarding smoother and more practical for digital natives (the most represented cohort in QSR), who can sign documents, provide information, and complete online training from their smartphones. 3. It makes compliance management easier Managing hourly workers comes with a list of labor laws and regulations around minimum wage, overtime pay, breaks and more. A digital platform makes it easy to spot missing information or errors and helps you maintain compliance. 4. You can hire faster QSR businesses often have busy seasons where they need to staff up quickly to meet increased demand. With a digital onboarding solution, you can ramp up hiring without the extra mess and stress of keeping documents signed and¬† organized. 5. You can support non-native English speakers Many digital onboarding solutions out there offer multilingual capabilities , making it easier for applicants and new hires to complete paperwork and have a comfortable onboarding experience. 6. It can help you tailor new hire training With a cloud-based onboarding tool, you can develop training programs that suit each specific role within your QSR operation, making the first weeks on the job engaging and effective for new workers. 5 steps to digital onboarding Digital onboarding starts right after someone is hired and can be divided into five steps: 1. Pre-boarding: Set up your new hire's digital profile including inputting basic personal information and collecting the required documents they'll need to review as part of their onboarding, such as contracts, tax forms, company handbooks, and policies. 2. Paperwork and authentication : New workers can now fill out the required forms and sign them digitally. The built-in authentication tools all you to verify the employee's identity in compliance with federal regulations automatically. 3. Orientation: Once paperwork is complete, new hires often get welcome packets and training materials so they can understand the company's values and expectations. 4. Training and integration: Digital onboarding solutions often enable you to customize training by role and can even help you schedule job shadowing sessions or meetings with managers to help new workers get up to speed in their roles. 5. Offboarding: When you need to remove a worker from your organization, digital onboarding platforms enable you to conduct exit surveys , secure any collected data, and close the account in a few quick steps.

The cost of bringing on a new hire can be as high as $3,000. Thankfully, tools like E-Verify help reduce the time, labor, and cost of onboarding. In this article, we‚Äôll cover everything you need to know about E-Verify from a human resources perspective. You‚Äôll learn the entirety of the verification process , how the enrollment system is implemented in HR, benefits, challenges, and how the technology will shape onboarding in the future. Understanding E-Verify The E-Verify program compares information from an employee‚Äôs Employment Eligibility Verification I-9 form to records available to the US Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and Social Security Administration ( SSA ). E-Verify reduces the chances of hiring unauthorized workers by automating the employee verification process . How Does E-Verify Work Understanding the E-Verify process is essential for all HR professionals. Below is a step-by-step guide covering the entire procedure, from submission to the employee‚Äôs verification notification. I-9 form is submitted: All new hires are asked to fill out the I-9 form containing basic information such as name, DOB, social security number , and US citizenship status. HR rep inputs the information into E-Verify : The HR department is responsible for inputting data from the I-9 form into the system within a few days of the employee‚Äôs start date. Database verification: E-Verify cross-references the submitted information using government databases, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security . Response: E-Verify instantly verifies whether the information matches government records . The response is usually one of the following, ‚Äú Employment Authorized ,‚Äù ‚Äú SSA Tentative Non-Confirmation ,‚Äù or ‚Äú DHS Verification in Process.‚Äù Resolving issues: If discrepancies or mismatches exist between the employee‚Äôs provided information and government records , the system will suggest further action . E-Verify could request additional documentation or a second verification process to resolve issues. Final verification: If there aren‚Äôt any issues or they‚Äôve been resolved, the system will confirm the employee‚Äôs work eligibility . Employee notification: Finally, employees are notified of the E-Verify results. If the outcome is not what they expected, they can contest or correct employee eligibility errors. Employee Eligibility Requirements E-Verify requests an I-9 form and documentation to verify employment eligibility. The I-9 form requires the following information for US-born citizens: Name Address Date of Birth Social Security Number For immigrants, the following is required: US citizen or immigration status Alien Number/ USCIS Number Form I-94 admission number Foreign passport number Both types of employees also need to sign and date the document. HR representatives are responsible for entering information regarding the documentation, their name, signature, date, organization name and address, and first day of employment. Documentation is also required. Acceptable forms include a passport, passport card, permanent resident card, and employee authorization document card. These documents are adequate on their own to verify employment status. Suppose an employee does not have one of the documents listed above. In that case, they will have to provide a combination of a picture ID (driver‚Äôs license, ID card, school ID, voter registration card, military ID, or Native American tribal document) and a record that validates citizenship, such as a Social Security Card, Birth Certificate, US Citizen ID card. Minors seeking employment are given alternatives to verify their work eligibility because most people under 18 don‚Äôt have a picture ID or passport. States that Require Use of E-Verify While E-Verify isn‚Äôt required by federal law, many states, including Florida , Texas , Georgia , Tennessee , and 18 other states, require E-Verify use for at least some employers and categories of employees. All federal contractors , subcontractors , and vendors must use E-Verify for their employees. Failing to comply with I-9 documentation regulations can result in fines of up to $5,500 per ineligible worker. Implementing E-Verify in HR Practices E-Verify is designed to help employers streamline the hiring process while ensuring employee eligibility. If you are adding the system to your hiring process, we recommend the following best practices: Create a case for each newly hired employees within three business days of their start date. Enter the employee‚Äôs email if it was provided on the I-9 form. Notify each employee in the instance of a mismatch so they have the opportunity to take action. Do not use E-Verify to pre-screen for employment. Do not terminate employees who received a mismatch . Complete the I-9 form before creating a case in E-Verify . Obtain the employee‚Äôs social security number through the I-9 form. Do not share the E-Verify case user ID and/or password. The Benefits of E-Verify for Employers In the United States, there is no other online employment verification service that is free and compares employee information against millions of U.S. government records . The process helps HR professionals streamline employee eligibility while ensuring they don‚Äôt hire unauthorized workers. Other benefits include: Decreases Social Security mismatches Provides immediate results Protects US workers Improves wage and tax reporting Eliminated chances for costly fines if unauthorized workers slip through the cracks Challenges of E-Verify While E-Verify is the best system for determining work authorization for new employees , there are challenges. For example, regulations are constantly changing and require HR departments to keep up with system changes. In addition, E-Verify requires staff to execute the procedures efficiently and accurately, requiring additional training. More challenges include: Data accuracy and discrepancies Potential for legal risks over sensitive information Risk of cyber crimes Technological learning curve While these elements of implementing an E-Verify system present challenges for HR departments, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. E-Verify and Legal Considerations When dealing with personal information, many legal and ethical precautions must be considered. E-Verify requires the collection of personally identifiable information (PII). As a result, HR professionals need to handle this information carefully, protecting applicants' privacy. Ensure you only share with authorized users, secure access to the E-Verify system , protect and store employee PII adequately, and only discuss results privately. In addition to handling sensitive information, HR professionals are expected never to use E-Verify to discriminate. Employers may not create cases based on race, citizenship status, nationality, or other characteristics. Mishandling PII and using E-Verify to discriminate are prohibited by US law and can result in audits and potential legal action. Future Trends and Predictions for E-Verify E-Verify has become a standard in employment verification since its inception in 1996. There are over one million registered E-Verify employers use the service today, and an average of 1,500 businesses sign up weekly. We expect E-Verify to continue to play a crucial role in HR practices, improving the verification process for employers and employees. The process will become more accurate and efficient as new technology is introduced into onboarding systems. Integrating new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning could streamline the verification process and reduce errors. In addition to new tech, we also expect to encounter additional regulations that help protect employees. As immigration policies shift, E-Verify will likely reflect these changes. HR professionals must stay updated on policy adjustments, ensuring compliance with privacy and fair employment policies. Implement E-Verify Into Your HR Process E-Verify stands as a pivotal tool in the landscape of HR practices, offering employers a systematic means to confirm the eligibility of their workforce while navigating the intricate terrain of employment compliance.

Let‚Äôs discuss the benefits of E-signatures and the challenges they can help you resolve by answering some FAQs . What is an E-signature ? E-signatures , sometimes called electronic signatures , are used to sign documents digitally to acknowledge a contract ‚Äì effectively replacing the need for a handwritten signature . E-signatures are most commonly used in the workforce during the onboarding process for new hires. Another valuable way to utilize the e-sign ability is when your organization changes its forms and compliance documents. The Esign Act of 2000 grants legality to e-signatures in all 50 U.S. States, making it a legally binding document when utilizing an electronic signature . The European Union ‚Äôs response is the EIDAS Act, which shows that their jurisdiction recognizes the need for e-signatures as well. Types of E-signatures With more of the onboarding process being digitized these days, new employees typically find themselves being prompted to e-sign their name after reading, filling out, or evaluating a vital document. If you choose to utilize an e-signature solution to help automate the signing process for your organization‚Äôs onboarding workflows , here are the different types to consider: Manual Signature ‚Äì One option is to duplicate the signer ‚Äôs wet signature . This will typically require the employee to use a mouse or a trackpad to imitate writing out their handwritten signature with a pen. Preselected Signature ‚Äì Some online systems will permit users to select a pre-generated e-signature that makes an approximation of the signer ‚Äôs own handwriting. They can then use this same e-signature to automate the signing process . Digitally Printed Name ‚Äì The last option is for the employee to use a printed version of their name instead of a regular signature. Typically, in this case, the system will present the user with a disclaimer that the employee will be asked to acknowledge, indicating that the printed name will be used in place of their handwritten signature . How do I get an E-signature ? Once I have one, how do I use it to e- sign documents ? Each type of e-signature will require a different method for creation. Typically, an electronic signature is created via the e-signature software that your organization uses to automate some of the document signing process while onboarding new hourly employees. For example, apps like Salesforce and Microsoft Word work with the DocuSign electronic signature software , allowing users to quickly create an e-signature to sign electronic documents . The steps are pretty simple: Install the DocuSign add-in by going to the app ‚Äôs menu bar‚Äôs insert tab and ‚ÄúGet Add-ins.‚Äù This will then open up your computer or phone‚Äôs app store. Type DocuSign in the Search bar and click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù to add DocuSign to Word, Salesforce , or whatever software you are using that works with it. Find DocuSign in the Menu tab once the add-in has been successfully loaded. There should be a new menu option called ‚Äú DocuSign .‚Äù Select that option, and then choose ‚Äú Sign Document .‚Äù Follow the steps to create your signature. To use your new electronic signature , drag and drop the Signature field to add it to the Word Document. Click ‚ÄúSignature,‚Äù found on the left-hand side of the page, and then click on the area in the doc where you want to include your e-signature . DocuSign will also provide the option to add initials, the date you signed, the printed name, and more. Once you click the yellow button that says ‚ÄúAdopt and Sign‚Äù found at the bottom part of the window, your new signature will appear in the desired position on the document. Click ‚ÄúFinish‚Äù at the top of the page. Now, your e-signature is ready to use whenever you need it! Other apps , such as Adobe , have their own electronic signature solution , which is just as simple to utilize! What are the differences between an E-signature and a digital signature ? While many people tend to use the two interchangeably, there are several differences between an E-signature and a digital signature . Both options help with the authentication of digital documents . However, there are various features that they do not share, and they have different applications. Digital Signature ‚Äôs primary function is to make it possible to identify a specific document while sealing and identifying the doc and protecting it from forgery, as well as safeguarding the signer ‚Äôs identity . It uses a secure digital certificate in place of their wet signature . In contrast, an e-signature demonstrates the intent of a signatory to bind them legally through the terms of a document. In most cases, leveraging both technologies makes sense to make things more secure. Use cases where an e-signature would be a better fit would be business contracts that show a signatory is choosing to agree with the terms laid out by the organization. Trust service providers and certification authorities better serve a digital signature to validate and verify the digital document . The UETA ( Uniform Electronic Transactions Act ) states that a digital signature may be legally used in place of a paper signature. How Do I Create a Digital Signature ? Now that you know how to create an E-signature , let‚Äôs discuss the creation of a digital signature . While the user can typically create E-signatures via contract parties in apps like Word, digital signatures are not made by a person. They are created by algorithms in software using advanced technology known as Public Key Infrastructure , which ensures data is transferred securely by generating a public and a private key. Since a digital signature relies on more strict security processes, it can be significantly more challenging to create than an e-signature , which is formed and added to the document by the user. Generally speaking, your organization will likely be better served by employing E-signatures for HR purposes. Why should my HR team switch to using E-signatures ? With the significant shift of the workforce into the remote realm, there are many benefits to using e-signatures during your onboarding process. Even in a more standard workplace, electronic signatures can streamline your organization‚Äôs HR workflows . Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the benefits below: Going green - By allowing your new hires to e-sign digital documents , you are saving money and resources and cutting down on your use of paper and ink. Saving tons of time - not only is an e-signature much quicker to write than a handwritten one, but it is also much more efficient to work with digital document templates for creating your HR docs , and it is faster to deliver them over email and file sharing services. Working Remotely - the adoption of e-signatures will allow you to shift to a fully remote workplace if that is in the cards for your company. The recent pandemic forced organizations to change to a remote office structure, and the ability to e- sign documents is crucial to making it work. There is no more need for in-person signature workflows . Safety and Security ‚Äì E-signatures and digital signatures allow the secure sharing of sensitive documents. Seamless transition ‚Äì E-signatures work with various third-party applications allowing you to integrate your onboarding materials via the different document formats available. You can then share your docs through apps such as Dropbox and Google Docs . Tracking Progress ‚Äì It can be challenging to stay on top of the current status of a document, especially when it requires signatures from multiple people. An e-signature software solution will provide HR with an audit trail and real-time notifications to alert you when your document has been signed. These electronic records make the process incredibly simple. Whether you need a more streamlined new hire onboarding process or a way to keep your sensitive documents more secure, electronic signatures can be the key to your continued success.

And while every company experiences offboarding (for better or for worse), a recent study found that nearly 70% of organizational leaders experienced unwanted impacts from poor offboarding. That's why implementing strategic offboarding processes is crucial for any organization. Offboarding, also known as exit management, refers to the steps a company takes when an employee leaves their job permanently. This transition period is just as important as onboarding a new hire . While many companies spend hours and resources perfecting their onboarding process , offboarding often gets overlooked. To ensure a successful transition and protect the interests of your company, you must look at this crucial part of the employee lifecycle and ensure all steps are taken to make it as smooth and efficient as possible. In this guide to proper offboarding, we will provide 5 best practices for offboarding employees smoothly and professionally. From documenting procedures to conducting insightful exit interviews , we will outline strategies to protect company knowledge, maintain team productivity, and enhance your employer brand . With nearly 4 million Americans quitting their jobs each month in 2022 , thoughtful offboarding is a must for retaining top talent and intellectual capital when valued team members move on. By the end of this article, you will have actionable steps for creating offboarding processes that benefit both the employee and the company. Let's get started with the first essential strategy: developing a standardized and thorough offboarding checklist . Best Practice #1: Have a Documented Offboarding Process A documented offboarding process provides a standardized roadmap for the actions and tasks that need to be completed when an employee leaves . Yet, for many companies, this process is often lacking, as time restraints and competing priorities get in the way of thorough offboarding. However, investing the time to develop an offboarding checklist and process is essential for ensuring that all tasks are completed before an employee departs. While every organization's process will be unique, an effective offboarding checklist often includes: Conducting exit interviews to gather feedback Completing necessary paperwork like handbooks to be returned and final pay information Canceling access to company accounts, systems, and tools Securing company property , including laptops , keys, and badges Making introductions between the departing employee and the individual(s) assuming their responsibilities Announcing the employee's departure and transition plan Answering questions from clients or vendors about the change Why Implement a Documented Offboarding Process ? Having these procedural steps documented brings several advantages: Consistency A standardized process applied to every scenario ensures all bases are covered each time. Rather than relying on a new manager to remember every detail of offboarding, having it spelled out makes sure nothing falls through the cracks. Efficiency Without written instructions on handling employee separations, onboarding staff may spend valuable time and energy figuring out what needs to be done. Having an offboarding process expedites the process so the team can move forward quickly. Compliance No organization wants to be found on the wrong side of labor laws or tax regulations. A well-documented, compliant offboarding process helps protect against legal issues now and in the future. Preparedness Advance documentation means offboarding tasks won't be missed. For instance, if a manager or HR person is unavailable, another team member can take over the duties. This ensures all employees are treated fairly and with respect when they leave. Efficiency Offboarding should be conducted as quickly and efficiently as possible. With a streamlined set of processes, every step of the way can be tracked and accounted for, eliminating potential delays or oversights. This helps ensure an organized transition to a new team member or position in a timely manner. Best Practice #2: Conduct Exit Interviews Exit interviews present a valuable opportunity to gather insights from departing employees that can lead to organizational improvements. During these discussions, managers aim to understand the employee's reasons for leaving, their overall experience, and honest feedback. Successful offboarding demands that these valuable insights are implemented within company data for future hiring. What should your exit interview questions include? It will depend on the situation, but often include targeted questions regarding the role, the reason for leaving, and how the manager and HR team can better prepare the next role. Well-run exit interviews allow companies to gain valuable feedback , such as: Identify issues causing turnover, like low compensation or lack of advancement opportunities Gather constructive criticism of policies, tools, or workflows that aren't working optimally Learn about strengths, weaknesses, and pain points from an insider's view Develop action plans for enhancing retention and company culture When conducting interviews, avoid getting defensive if feedback is critical. Ask probing questions to fully understand the root causes behind the employee's input. Key topics to cover include: Reasons for resigning and assessments of job duties Opinions of management styles, team dynamics, and corporate values Experience with onboarding , training, technology, and resources provided Suggestions for improvements to policy, culture, or workload Document all responses thoroughly to uncover actionable patterns. Then develop plans for implementing changes based on constructive feedback. While exit interviews require effort and self-reflection, they provide invaluable insights from talented employees before they move on. This helps enhance processes for current and future team members . Best Practice #3: Provide Knowledge Transfer When an employee leaves an organization, they take with them institutional knowledge that is difficult to replace. This intellectual capital and deep understanding of internal processes, client history, and technical systems are built over years of service. That's why it's critical to capture this knowledge before the employee departs through structured knowledge transfer . Effective strategies for sharing knowledge during the employee offboarding process include: Develop and implement cross-training Have the departing employee train an existing team member over a period of weeks. They can review key responsibilities, systems, and contacts together. This not only allows for knowledge transfer but also helps the new team member understand the full scope of the role. Human resources should work closely with new employees to determine if the onboarding process may benefit from better cross-training. Create and document work processes Before the offboarding process , have the departing employee document their existing processes and workflows . This can be as simple as written checklists or detailed process diagrams with supporting documents. In situations where the separation process is not immediate, small changes can be documented over time. Record videos for future reference With modern video conferencing technology, employees can quickly record videos demonstrating their work processes and share them with the team. This is especially helpful in cases where there are complex tasks that need to be demonstrated step by step. Co-workers can often help one another by watching the videos and providing guidance. Create a knowledge repository Maintaining an internal knowledge base or Google doc for reference can help ensure that key information isn‚Äôt lost at the time of an employee exit Encourage employees to document frequently asked questions, troubleshooting guides, and product information. Regularly review the repository to make sure it‚Äôs up-to-date and accurate. Identify knowledge gaps As you create the knowledge repository, it‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôll discover gaps in knowledge that need to be filled. Communicate with employees and identify which areas could use more information. Then, create a plan for how you will fill those gaps - ensuring that the employee experience for both the old and new hire end on good terms . Set up times for knowledge sharing All of the above isn‚Äôt beneficial without a plan for knowledge sharing. Create times and spaces for employees to get together and share what they know‚Äîthis could be during regular team meetings, through small group breakouts, or online via video conferencing. Let your team choose which strategies work best for them. Without conscious efforts to capture knowledge, organizational continuity is at risk when an employee leaves . However, by facilitating comprehensive knowledge sharing, their unique contributions and intellectual capital will continue benefiting your company long after their last day . Best Practice #4: Clearly Communicate the Departure When an employee leaves , it creates uncertainty and questions among remaining staff. Without clear communication, rumors and confusion may lower morale and productivity. That's why it's important to get ahead of the situation by promptly informing all stakeholders. If you want to help ensure an effective offboarding process without drama, make sure to communicate with existing employees regarding the situation involving the exiting employee . This often involved the HR department , and could involve the following: Require a letter of resignation , unless the exit is due to a layoff Send a company-wide email from leadership briefly explaining the employee's decision, thanking them for their service, and outlining the transition plan. Schedule a team meeting to make the announcement in person. Answer questions transparently while remaining positive. Immediately reassign the departing employee 's responsibilities and introduce their replacement to clients and colleagues. If the employee left on difficult terms, avoid sharing details and making disparaging comments that could damage team cohesion or company reputation. Express confidence in the company's future and the remaining team's ability to maintain excellence. Clear, direct, and respectful communication ensures the team stays focused on priorities rather than gossip. It also reinforces professionalism in the offboarding process . Being thoughtful, honest, and solutions-oriented when announcing departures enables smooth transitions . Here is an example email template communicating an employee departure : Subject: Team Update - Eric Miller's Departure Dear Team, I'm writing to share that Eric Miller, our Senior Project Manager, has resigned from his role effective at the end of this month. Over the past 5 years, Eric has been an invaluable contributor and leader within our department. He has spearheaded major initiatives that have significantly benefitted our clients and moved the company forward. I know you all join me in thanking Eric for his positive impact and wishing him the very best in his future endeavors. Moving forward, Anu Singh will be taking over Eric's project management responsibilities. Anu has been shadowing Eric and learning about his key accounts these past few weeks to ensure a seamless transition. Please join me in welcoming Anu into this new role and supporting her however you can during this period. While Eric's contributions will be missed, I'm confident that Anu has the experience and expertise to excel as our new Senior Project Manager. This transition exemplifies our team's dedication to collaboration and commitment to our clients' success. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns about these changes. I appreciate everyone's flexibility amidst this transition. Let's continue working together to deliver outstanding results. Best, [Manager Name] Best Practice #5: Disable Access and Retrieve Company Property As an employee's last day approaches, one of HR's most critical offboarding responsibilities is overseeing their transition off company systems and premises. This involves: Disabling ID badges , access cards, logins, email, servers, databases, and other technology resources. Make sure to revoke access to protect proprietary information and intellectual property. Collecting company property , including laptops , mobile devices, uniforms, keys, corporate credit cards , and identification badges. Keep thorough records of all use of company equipment . Closing out financial relationships and accounts like expense reporting, stipends, memberships, and subscriptions. Reminding about non-compete, IP, and non-disclosure obligations - including and aspects involving social media use. Notify the individual of the details regarding their final paycheck . Follow a checklist to ensure all loose ends are covered regarding employee access to sensitive information or data. HR should complete these offboarding steps on the employee's final workday. Sudden loss of access helps reinforce that the individual no longer represents the company. Rigorous offboarding also reduces security risks from unauthorized access, theft of property, or misuse of funds. While uncomfortable, strong controls around system access, facilities, and assets are necessary. Establish procedures and timelines for rapidly removing departing employees from the company's infrastructure. This ensures a clean break that protects the interests of both parties.

This innovative technology takes every aspect of the onboarding process and puts it in a centralized location, which streamlines the workflow for Human Resources and personalizes the experience for your new hires . Let‚Äôs explore the key components and capabilities of employee onboarding software and the benefits for your company. Centralized Onboarding Portals Employee onboarding software will typically provide a centralized online hub where your new employees can access all essential information, documents, and training materials. These portals serve as a central platform for all onboarding-related tasks, ensuring that new employees have easy access to helpful resources in a singular location. Automated Workflows Your onboarding HR software platform can automate most processes and workflows , such as electronic signatures and document submissions, required assignments, interactive training modules , and progress tracking.

Electronic Document Management No more sorting through mounds of paperwork or giving your new hires hand cramps as they struggle to fill out form after form! Employee onboarding software facilitates the electronic management and signing of documents. It allows new employees to fill out forms, sign contracts, and submit necessary paperwork from the comfort of their keyboard. As a benefit for your HR team members , digital document management is more accurate and secure while eliminating the need for piles of physical paperwork, which simplifies your HR processes . Task Reminders and Notifications You can set up automated task reminders and notifications between HR professionals, managers, and new hires , ensuring all parties know about pending tasks and looming deadlines.

Social Integration and Collaboration Tools Many onboarding software solutions incorporate a feature that fosters social integration .

Personalized onboarding experiences enhance employee engagement and streamline the process by which new employees receive relevant, role-specific information and training. Integration with Existing Human Resource Systems Just because you decided to invest in a new employee onboarding software platform, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you need to throw out your pre-existing systems. Many employee onboarding systems can integrate seamlessly with your current HR system, creating a wholly unified platform. This level of integration ensures that all relevant employee information, from the onboarding progress to performance evaluations, is consolidated and accessible within a unified interface. It also eliminates the need to switch between multiple platforms. Technologically Advanced Software Solutions Historically, onboarding new employees in the traditional, manual way has always been an excessively laborious and sometimes frustrating task for all involved parties. Both HR professionals and new hires are up to their eyeballs in a mountain of paperwork. New employees also have to deal with extensive training and orientation sessions, while Human Resources is tasked with the manual process of tracking employee progress. Not only does this approach waste everyone‚Äôs valuable time and resources, but it also puts a damper on employee‚Äôs experience and limits productivity. Additionally, the risk of human error and miscommunication is relatively high, leading to a potentially poor experience for new employees negatively impacting overall employee retention and satisfaction. In the constantly evolving world of business operations, the seamless integration of new employees into the workforce is crucial for the success of your organization. The end-to-end process of hiring and onboarding is traditionally an endeavor that is time-consuming and heavy on the physical paperwork.

Share this article The past few years have been less than ideal for restaurants and brick-and-mortar dining.

Modern POS systems provide features such as Contactless payment options Table management and order management Digital menus and mobile app features Inventory management and menu management Reporting tools for data analysis Mobile applications for efficient order-taking (i.e., QR code options) Automated marketing campaigns Gift cards and mobile POS software features at tableside These features often come bundled in a modern POS system, making it easier for businesses to stay ahead of the competition. But always look closely at what your potential POS system offers - and if you don‚Äôt need a particular feature, be sure to choose one that doesn‚Äôt include it so you don‚Äôt end up paying extra for something you won't use. For instance, do you need to invest in credit card or ecommerce services for your cafe ? Are CRM and dashboards necessary for getting the right metrics ? Your goals will determine your needs; Restaurant Scheduling Software While many restaurant software systems focus outward to customer experience , ensuring that your staff can effectively manage their time is just as important. Restaurant scheduling software automates employee shift management, making it easy to create staff rotas and track hours worked for payroll purposes. Restaurant scheduling software enables managers and staff to monitor current and upcoming shifts, check employee availability for any given shift, ensure the right staffing levels are in place at the correct times, communicate quickly and efficiently about changes or requests, and much more. You‚Äôd be shocked at how many restaurants depend on paper-based methods for scheduling employee shifts ‚Äì often due to tradition and a lack of time to invest in the research and implementation of new systems. However, with restaurant scheduling software, you can reduce human error, save time and money, and promote a healthy work-life balance for your staff. This will all help make sure your business runs like clockwork! Inventory Management and Forecasting How is your stock looking? Are you overstocked on certain items? Do you need to restock ingredients for a dish that is proving popular? If restaurant scheduling software keeps your staff updated with the latest information, inventory management , and forecasting , do the same for your products. You can save money by reducing waste and knowing exactly when to place more orders for specific items. Not only can you save money, but your customers will enjoy better quality dishes due to having the right ingredients available at all times. Kitchen Display Systems Having an efficient kitchen setup is vital in a restaurant. No matter how good your staff is at memorizing orders, kitchen display systems can help keep the process running smoothly and cut down on errors. Display system solutions send orders directly to the kitchen, reducing the need for a waiter or waitress to bring them over. This can be especially valuable during busy periods, where staff may not have time to remember all the orders and deliver them in a timely manner. You can even add timers or alerts to ensure food reaches customers at the optimum temperature. Restaurant Financial Analytics and Reporting Software Perhaps one of the most understated areas of restaurant management is financial analytics and reporting. Simply put, if you can‚Äôt measure it, you can‚Äôt manage it. Knowing to the penny how much money your restaurant is making on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis allows for better strategic decision-making. A robust financial analytics and reporting software solution can provide you with a 360-degree view of your restaurant‚Äôs performance. You can take advantage of insights such as: Sales performance and trends Cost of goods sold tracking Profitability analysis Cash flow forecasting Inventory management These insights can help you plan for the future, identify areas for improvement, and make sure you stay ahead of cash flow issues. Plus, should you have stakeholders or investors, easy-to-use reporting tools can give you better transparency into the state of your finances. Accurate reporting also allows your operators and managers to track progress against goals easily. They can translate meal cost data into labor and food costs , compare sales across multiple locations, and even look at customer behavior over time so they can learn more about their guests‚Äô needs and preferences. Software for Hiring Hourly Employees One of the key challenges facing many restaurants is hiring and managing hourly employees. A key restaurant software to invest in is a hiring system that is integrated with your restaurant management system . From creating detailed job descriptions to organizing and tracking applicant information to scheduling interviews and onboarding new hires, a comprehensive restaurant hiring system can help streamline the recruitment process and save time. When you can identify the right applicants ‚Äì and track them through the recruitment and onboarding process ‚Äì you can be sure to make the right hires for your team. With good restaurant software, you‚Äôll also have access to detailed reporting analytics that allow you to track employee performance over time, ensuring that you will always have people on board who are passionate about their jobs and willing to work hard. Onboarding Software: A Seamless Start for New Hires Once you find the right candidates for your restaurant roles, it‚Äôs just as essential to make sure they have a smooth onboarding experience. For this, you‚Äôll want to invest in a restaurant onboarding software package tailored to your business. Too many restaurants struggle to adequately onboard their new hires ‚Äì leading to increased turnover and higher costs. With a good onboarding software package, you can ensure your new hires start off on the right foot by providing comprehensive job training materials and information about company policies. Plus, you‚Äôll be able to track progress within the onboarding program to ensure that all new hires have all the tools they need to succeed in their role. Payroll Systems for Restaurants Paying your employees on time is one of the most important tasks of a restaurant manager. If you can‚Äôt get your payroll done correctly, it‚Äôs going to create a lot of headaches for you and your staff. Investing in a sound payroll system can help streamline the process and automate calculations so that everything runs smoothly every pay period. Plus, many payroll systems also offer integrated time-tracking features that allow you to monitor employee hours in real time and make sure everyone is paid accurately. Benefits Administration Within your payroll software or restaurant management system , you‚Äôll want to make sure your staff is able to easily access their benefits information. This can include health insurance, dental insurance, any prepaid vacation or sick days they‚Äôve earned, and other supplemental benefits. Your payroll software should also offer detailed reports so you can stay on top of any changes in tax laws that could affect your employees‚Äô payments. This kind of transparency will help keep your team informed and on the same page. Employee Portals Just like benefits administration, you should also have access to employee portals that allow your staff to manage their personal information and make updates as needed. These portals can serve as an additional resource for employees when they need help using the payroll system, updating their contact info, or making changes to their withholding allowances. They should also be able to easily access documents like W-2s and other vital records. With these features and tools, you‚Äôll have the assurance that your payroll system is always up-to-date and compliant with regulations. Plus, choosing a user-friendly option make it easier for everyone involved to stay on top of their responsibilities. Restaurant Computer Systems (POS and Beyond) There are a variety of other technology solutions you can implement in your restaurant to make life easier. Security Systems Your restaurant should be equipped with an effective security system to ensure the safety of both your employees and customers. Security cameras, motion sensors, and access control systems are just a few tools you can use to keep your business secure. iPad -based terminals and kiosk options are often available. Data Storage Solutions In addition to protecting your business, you must have access to all the information about running a successful restaurant. From customer orders and employee records to inventory tracking and customer loyalty programs , data storage solutions provide a secure way to store important information. Automation Automation can help streamline the operations of your restaurant. From ordering and payment systems to scheduling and payroll processes, automation helps your staff stay organized and efficient while providing customers with a seamless experience. Automation can also help reduce labor costs and save time. Data Security It's essential to keep your customer and employee data secure. Implementing measures such as two-factor authentication, encrypting sensitive information, using strong passwords, and regularly backing up your data can help you protect yourself against cyberattacks. The last thing you want is for your restaurant to become a target of hackers. With the right security measures, you can help keep your data safe and secure. Marketing Software Solutions Adopting marketing automation can help restaurants stay competitive. You can use automated tools like email campaigns and social media to reach new customers and engage existing ones. This not only saves time but also allows you to track user behavior and optimize your messages for maximum engagement with your restaurant business . FAQ Which software does restaurant use?

Share this article In today's whirlwind business environment, finding the perfect hire feels like searching for a needle in a haystack‚Äîand you need that needle, like, yesterday. Especially if you're in an industry dependent on hourly workers, you're no stranger to the constant juggling act. You've got high turnover rates breathing down your neck, a clock that never stops ticking, and a business to run. Sound familiar? If so, you've come to the right place. In this article, we'll dissect what makes a good hiring software . We'll dive into its must-have features, benefits, and the key questions you should be asking before taking the plunge. What is Hiring Software ? Hiring software is your all-in-one digital toolbelt for the recruitment process . Designed to make hiring quicker, more organized, and efficient, this technology covers everything from posting job ads and sorting through resumes to conducting interviews and initiating the onboarding process . It's particularly indispensable for businesses reliant on hourly employees, where rapid and accurate hiring isn't just a luxury, it's a necessity. With automated features and data-driven insights, hiring software streamlines recruitment, ensuring you find the right talent when you need it the most. What is a Hiring System? A hiring system is a comprehensive framework and organized methodology that governs your entire recruitment process . While hiring software plays a crucial role within this system, it's essential to recognize that a complete hiring system goes beyond just technology. It encompasses a synergy of human decision-making, seamless team collaboration , and strategic planning. At its core, a hiring system is the blueprint for attracting, assessing , and selecting top talent to join your organization. It starts with defining your recruitment objectives and understanding your company's unique culture and values. From there, it encompasses the strategies and processes that guide every step of the journey, from sourcing candidates to onboarding new hires . In this approach, technology, such as applicant tracking systems and assessment tools, aids in streamlining tasks and enhancing efficiency. However, it's complemented by the expertise of your hiring team who make critical decisions about candidates' qualifications, cultural fit, and potential contributions. In summary, a hiring system is not solely reliant on technology but rather a harmonious blend of advanced tools, human expertise, collaborative efforts, and forward-thinking strategies. It's the framework that propels your organization toward its talent acquisition goals, ensuring that you attract and retain the best-fit candidates who will contribute to your company's success. Key Features of a Good Hiring Software If you're venturing into the world of hiring software , you're likely swamped with options. To sift through the noise, it's important to know what to look for. What makes one piece of hiring software stand out from the rest? Let's check out the key features that can make or break your recruitment efforts , especially when hiring hourly employees. User-Friendly Interface First things first‚Äîa good hiring software should be easy to use. Nobody has the time to wade through complicated dashboards when they're in a rush to hire. An intuitive user interface ensures that your team can hit the ground running. Multi-Platform Job Posting A quality hiring software allows you to post job openings across multiple platforms with just a few clicks. This is a boon for businesses with hourly roles to fill, widening the candidate pool exponentially. Automated Resume Screening The right hiring software will use AI-driven algorithms to automatically sift through resumes , picking out the most suitable candidates based on your criteria. This saves you the time you'd otherwise spend manually sorting through possibly hundreds of resumes . Interview Scheduling and Follow-Ups Automated interview scheduling and follow-up emails are more than just convenient; they're essential in a good hiring software . These features ensure you never miss out on a potential gem of a candidate due to a scheduling snafu. Analytics and Reporting Data is king, and good hiring software knows it. Robust analytics features can offer invaluable insights into your hiring process , revealing bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement. Integration with Existing Systems Last but not least, look for hiring software that integrates seamlessly with your existing systems‚Äîwhether it's an ATS , an HRIS , or any other employee management software. This ensures a streamlined hiring process from start to finish, which is indispensable for managing the quick turnover rates typical with hourly employees. Why is Good Hiring Software So Important? Choosing the right hiring software is far more than just ticking boxes on a functionality list; it's about enhancing your entire workflow for talent acquisition . Here's why opting for the right solution is crucial. Streamlined Sourcing Good hiring software simplifies candidate sourcing , making it easier for you to discover top talent across various platforms, from LinkedIn to specialized job boards . This is particularly crucial for hiring managers who need to find qualified candidates for open positions in a time-sensitive environment. Efficient Applicant Tracking System ( ATS ) The core of any great hiring software is its applicant tracking system ( ATS ). This feature doesn't just track job applications ; it actively sorts and ranks potential candidates , streamlining your hiring needs and cutting down your time-to-hire . Comprehensive Assessments Quality hiring software comes with built-in assessments , enabling you to gauge candidate skills before they even set foot in the interview room. This ensures that your new hires are truly qualified, making the hiring team 's job that much easier. Elevated Candidate Experience Let's face it, in today's competitive job market, the candidate experience matters. From easy-to-navigate career sites to automated messaging and updates, the right hiring software keeps job seekers engaged and informed. Collaboration and Teamwork Collaborative hiring is becoming the norm, and good hiring software facilitates this by allowing multiple team members‚Äîfrom human resources to specific hiring managers ‚Äîto work together seamlessly. Pricing and Budget Management Budget is often a concern, and the best recruiting software will offer scalable pricing options that fit your company's needs, without skimping on essential features like background checks and customer support . Robust CRM Candidate Relationship Management ( CRM ) is another essential piece of the puzzle. A good CRM within the hiring platform allows for better management of your talent pool , fostering stronger relationships with job seekers and referrals alike. DE&I Focus In an age where Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ( DE&I ) are paramount, look for hiring software that includes DE&I metrics and functionality . This allows your HR teams to keep track of diversity goals and incorporate them into your overall employer brand . Mobile Accessibility The right hiring software will also offer a mobile app , ensuring that you can manage staffing needs on-the-go, which is especially handy for businesses that operate across multiple locations or have remote HR teams . Analytics and Metrics A good recruiting platform will offer detailed metrics and analytics, enabling you to measure everything from the effectiveness of your job descriptions to the efficiency of your career page . This data-driven approach ensures that you can continually fine-tune your hiring system for better results. So, whether you're a small business or a larger enterprise, choosing the right hiring software goes beyond mere convenience. It's about setting up an end-to-end recruiting solution that aligns perfectly with your hiring strategy, ensuring you attract, assess, and onboard the right talent for your business needs. Key Questions to Ask Before Choosing a Hiring Software Before you start exploring different hiring software options, there are important questions you should ask. These questions matter a lot if you're hiring hourly workers and need a tool that's both strong and flexible. How Customizable is the Software? Your business has its own needs, so standard templates won't be enough. Can the software be tailored to fit your job descriptions , or is it limited to generic forms? The more the software can be adjusted to fit your needs, the better. Does it Support Posting on Multiple Channels? Job seekers use different platforms to look for work, including LinkedIn , social media , and job boards . Your hiring software should let you post jobs across these platforms to reach more potential candidates . What is the Quality of Customer Support ? Nothing is worse than facing a problem and not having help available. Good hiring software should offer strong customer support for times when you run into issues, especially for fast-paced hiring needs . How Effective is the Resume Reading Feature? The resume reading feature, often called parsing , is a critical part of your recruiting toolkit. A bad parsing system can miss good candidates or, worse, recommend bad ones. Is it Compatible with Current Systems? Good hiring software should be cloud-based and integrate easily with your existing applicant tracking system , HR software , or other systems you use, without requiring a complete change of tools. Is it Friendly to Diversity Goals? Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ( DE&I ) matter for a balanced workforce. Does the software offer built-in DE&I features and metrics to help you track your goals? What is the Pricing Model? Many software options have pricing plans that adjust to different business sizes, making them good for small businesses and large companies alike. Make sure the software offers value for its cost and fits your budget. Tech Trends That Are Reshaping the Hiring Process The landscape of recruitment is undergoing significant transformation, driven by advancements in technology. Gone are the days when hiring was solely dependent on manual screenings, one-on-one interviews, and gut instincts. Today, cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), video conferencing, and gamification are revolutionizing how companies approach the hiring process . AI and Machine Learning (ML) are increasingly being adopted in recruitment to analyze resumes , screen candidates, schedule interviews, and identify patterns in candidate data to make better hiring decisions. For instance, ML algorithms can identify patterns in candidate data to facilitate better hiring, while AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants can automate initial interviews, freeing up time for more in-depth discussions with potential hires‚Äã‚Äã. Video Interviewing : The popularity of video interviewing has risen, especially with the onset of remote work. Companies are adapting their recruitment methods to accommodate mobile-friendly applications and video interviews, making the hiring process easier and more accessible for candidates. This trend is likely to continue as it enables companies to reach a wider pool of candidates and facilitates remote interviewing, which has become more common due to the pandemic‚Äã‚Äã. Gamification in Candidate Assessments : Gamification is being seen as an effective way to motivate candidates and assess their skills in a more engaging and natural manner. Elements of game design, such as points, leaderboards, rewards, and achievements, are incorporated into the assessment process to make it more engaging and entertaining. Gamification not only enhances the candidate experience but also provides a more accurate representation of a candidate‚Äôs skills and cultural fit for the organization‚Äã‚Äã. Augmented Reality (AR) for Virtual Workplace Tours : AR technology is gaining traction as a tool for enhancing the recruitment process . While specific information on virtual workplace tours is scarce, AR's potential in training and collaborative efforts in a work environment is well-documented. AR can bridge the gap between remote and in-person collaboration by offering a shared virtual lens for teams to interact in real-time, even when physically apart‚Äã 1 ‚Äã. Similarly, this technology can be extrapolated to provide virtual workplace tours to candidates, helping them experience the company culture and workspace interactively. Though not exactly the same, Virtual Reality (VR) has been used for similar purposes, like creating virtual tours of company offices or conducting remote interviews. Wrapping Up In conclusion, finding top talent doesn't have to be an insurmountable challenge if you have the right recruiting tools at your disposal. Award-winning tracking software can offer capabilities that even seasoned recruitment agencies might miss. The pros of incorporating these tools into your hiring process are numerous, making it easier than ever to streamline applications and zero in on the most promising candidates. Leveraging modern technology in this way is a game-changer for anyone in the competitive field of recruitment.

From securing a pool of applicants and filtering through endless resumes to scheduling interviews, finding reliable employees can feel like a full-time job. How do you find reliable applicants faster? Starting an employee referral program is a great strategy. R eferred applicants are less likely to turnover and more likely to be high performers. Having a referral program in place allows your employees to be an additional layer of filtering in the hiring process, where they can help in determining whether the job would be a good fit for the candidate and vice versa. Your employees are the best ambassadors for your business because they know how the company functions and what personalities and characteristics are the best fit for your company culture. Ever heard of the saying birds of a feather flock together ? By tapping into your employees‚Äô network, you increase the chances of getting more applicants with similar characteristics as your current employees, as they‚Äôre likely to befriend people similar to themselves. This means if your employee is hardworking or detail-oriented, the person they refer could have similar characteristics too. On the flip side, they can also determine if their friends or family members have the skills and work ethic you‚Äôre looking for. This means they‚Äôre more likely to recommend applicants suited for the role and will also be careful about who they refer because their reputation is also on the line. Do you need an employee referral program? Before you go buying gift cards and telling your employees to refer their friends, take a step back to consider your business case and any potential legal issues. Ask yourself these questions: How many hours could you save in recruiting by having a referral program in place? What are the cost savings? What are the costs necessary to put a referral program in place? Weigh the pros, cons, and costs to evaluate if this is the right move for your hiring strategy‚Äîand to help get buy-in from others involved in your hiring process if needed. Also look into the legalities. Do you have an in-house legal counsel, and if not, should you consider having one ? Legal counsel is important to ensure you‚Äôre building your program fairly and avoiding unintentional discrimination. Think of potential loopholes or areas that could be questioned. Ensure the referral program is open to the entire organization, all candidates will be screened equally, and fair recruiting methods are employed when sharing about new openings in the organization. Building an employee referral program A successful employee referral program is clearly defined, easy to follow, and optimized often. These are the five steps you should take to build a well-rounded and impactful program. Define the objectives Determine the process Decide on the incentive Collect feedback and review Amplify the program Define the objectives As an HR leader or hiring manager, ask yourself what your goal for the hiring program is. This helps you form the foundation of the program, how the process is structured, and what goals have to be met. Is your goal to hire X more employees a month? Or to increase employee retention by X months? Or to improve the culture fit of new employees? Once you‚Äôve identified your program‚Äôs goals, you can tie it to outcomes like lower recruitment costs, fewer hours devoted to hiring, a higher percentage of accepted job offers, higher quality applicants, and more. These are all important metrics to track especially in the review stage because it allows you to determine the effectiveness of your referral program. Determine the process Referral programs should be as straightforward as possible because the last thing you want to do is deter employees from making a referral. Use the following questions to determine your process. How should you collect referrals? Employees could submit referrals through a form Some intranet portals enable employees to submit referrals Employees can make email introductions between you and their referee You can include a¬† section in job applications that allows applicants to fill in the name and email address of their referrer. What information should you collect? If you're collecting referrals through your applications, an applicant tracking system will manage your referrals for you. If you're using an alternative method listed above, be sure to collect all the information you need about the referee (name, email address, phone number) and the referrer (name, email address, phone number, employee number, location, etc.). Will you fast-track applications? Another question to consider is whether or not you will fast-track referred applicants. Do they get to skip a round of interviews, or do they go through the same hiring process as other applicants? Who can refer applicants? Some organizations restrict HR employees from participating due to a conflict of interest. Many organizations limit their programs to full-time, permanent employees, and exclude temporary employees. Clearly indicate the terms and conditions of your program so your employees know who can participate and what is considered a successful referral, such as when they can expect to receive an incentive (if this is X days after the new hire's first day, or after they have passed their new hire probation period). How will you announce and promote your referral program? Tell your team in company-wide emails, during shift meetings, or even via your intranet or bulletin board. Think about how to market this to external candidates as well, as it could be considered an attractive employee benefit. It should also be part of the new hire onboarding process so all employees are aware of the program and know how to participate. Communication should be ongoing. Decide on the incentive Referral programs often come with an incentive to reward employees when their referee is offered the job. You may choose to go with a standard referral bonus or non-cash incentives like an extra day off, charity donations, food treats, or even recognition. Consider your incentive based on your budget and what you know about motivating your team. Incentives can even differ based on the type of role you‚Äôre hiring for. An employee who helped fill a harder-to-fill position could receive a larger referral bonus. Determine if a one-off payment, which is more commonly done, or a split payment works better for your organization. One-off payments are often processed once the new hire has been onboarded. Split payments are broken out into two cycles: after the new hire has been onboarded and when they‚Äôve completed their probation period. Collect feedback and review After a month or two of running your employee referral program, begin asking for feedback and conducting reviews. This allows you to identify if the referral program is meeting the goals and objectives set in step 1. Review: Goals and objectives: Keep track of referrals to determine long-term goals such as retention and culture fit. Process : Do employees find it hard to use the system? Did anyone have issues receiving the incentive? How can you make the process more streamlined? Incentives: Have there been sufficient referrals? If not, consider looking into better incentives to motivate employees. You can even ask them! Metrics: Look at the number of employees hired from the referral program as opposed to other recruiting methods, the employee participation rate, your new hire retention rate, etc. Constantly reviewing your referral program allows you to find areas for improvement and sometimes even uncover examples of employees abusing the system that you need to address. Amplify the program Now that you‚Äôve launched and optimized your employee referral program, it‚Äôs time to increase its reach. Here are some ways to take your program up a notch: Accept referrals all the time instead of only when you have an active open position. This enables you to build a solid pool of applicants you can tap into when a position does open. Just remember to ask permission to keep an applicant‚Äôs resume on file. Have open communication with the employees and the candidates on the status of their referrals to build trust and provide a positive experience for both parties. This encourages both the referrer and the referee to participate again should the opportunity arise. Share feedback on their referrals with your employees, such as their strengths and weaknesses and why their referral got accepted or rejected. This helps your employees learn what you‚Äôre looking for and helps them communicate with their friend or family member if they don't get the job. Have an efficient hiring process and evaluate candidates quickly to prevent losing them to other companies in the hiring process due to slow or no response The right HR technology makes managing your applicant pool easier. Explore the features that have the biggest impact on streamlining your hiring process.

For example, 57% of employees have access to life insurance through their employer, and 74% have access to healthcare benefits. Employee benefits come in many shapes and sizes, and they‚Äôre all designed to provide employees with the support they need to care for themselves and their family, along with adding some incentives to continue their employment. For employers who want to create a better work environment for their employees, here‚Äôs a complete employee benefit guide to answer your questions and point you in the right direction. What are employee benefits? Employee benefits are any sort of compensation (whether tangible or intangible) given to employees in addition to their standard wages or salaries. These benefits range from anything including simple perks like free snacks or a ping pong table (yes, that counts) up to paid leave, childcare, healthcare, or even bonuses. Anything an employer provides their employees outside of regular pay counts as an employee work benefit. Why benefits for employees matter It‚Äôs true; implementing and managing benefits for employees takes time and energy for your HR team ‚Äî which means money from your business. But it‚Äôs worth it to ensure your employees are happy, healthy, and can sufficiently provide for themselves and their families. When your employees feel like the company cares about their wellbeing, they‚Äôre more likely to stick around for the long-term. Employee benefits are one of the best employee retention strategies that you can implement for your business. According to online surveys, 49% of employees will start looking for new jobs in the next year because their current work benefits are insufficient or difficult to understand. Considering the average cost of replacing an employee is between one-half to two times the employee‚Äôs annual salary, which can be upwards of $60,000 per incident, providing sufficient employee benefits can actually save your company time and money ‚Äî not to mention headaches of going through the hiring process time and time again. And speaking of hiring processes, providing sufficient employee benefits can also help you speed up the hiring process and find quality candidates. Seeing enticing benefits in a job listing encourages more quality applicants to apply to your positions. Potential applicants are even more likely to apply to a job that pays less than what they want if the benefits meet or exceed their needs. Yes, providing employee benefits will add to your HR workload, but they will also help decrease it in other areas. Your HR team will be able to enjoy faster and smoother hiring processes, along with lower turnover rates. In the end, work benefits save your company time and money. Plus, they help you retain experienced workers, boosting your overall productivity for years to come. Four main types of employee benefits Since benefits include literally anything beyond standard pay, there‚Äôs really no limit to the number of employee benefits you can offer. However, most employee benefits packages fall into these four categories: Health and wellness Retirement plans Additional compensation Work/life balance benefits The ideal employee benefit package will contain elements of each of the four types of employee benefits; however, you‚Äôre welcome to mix-and-match as your company sees fit. Each type of benefit provides specific ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù to your business. Health and wellness Health and wellness benefits are the most common type of employee benefit offered by employers. These are benefits that support an employee‚Äôs wellbeing, the most common typed of employee benefits insurance are: Health insurance (including medical, dental, and vision) Life insurance Disability insurance Prescription drug coverage Employee assistance Mental health benefits In many cases, employers will match a portion of their employees‚Äô insurance costs, or they‚Äôll provide a base level of coverage that employees can build upon from there. There are some employers that cover the entire cost of insurance for their employees. It all depends on what your company wants to do and can afford. Providing health and wellness employee benefits shows that your business cares about your employees. Since most health insurance options cover the family as well, it also shows you care about your employees‚Äô families. Typically, standard health insurance like medical were enough to make employees happy, but times could be changing. According to online polls, 82% of employed Gen Zers believe mental health benefits should be a priority in the workplace. This is something that wasn‚Äôt even on HR professionals‚Äô radars even a few years ago, but it‚Äôs becoming increasingly important for employers to offer more comprehensive health benefits if they want to make their employees happy. Retirement plans One of the best employee benefits is retirement plans. Nobody wants to work forever, and employees want to know that all their hard work will pay off (quite literally) when they‚Äôre ready to retire. Retirement employee benefits show that a business isn‚Äôt just invested in their employees for what they can provide right now. Instead, it shows they‚Äôre interested in their employees‚Äô entire lives and wants them to feel secure in their future. The most common type of retirement benefit is a 401(k) contribution. With every paycheck, both the employee and the employer contribute to the employee‚Äôs 401(k) retirement account. The employee chooses how they want to invest their contributions and how much they want to contribute, and the employer matches a percentage of the employee‚Äôs contributions. Employers may also choose to implement a defined retirement plan that‚Äôs completely funded by the company, otherwise known as a pension plan. When an employee retires, they receive a set monthly benefit based on their tenure at the company and retirement age. Additional compensation Who couldn‚Äôt use a little extra cash every now and then? Additional compensation bonuses are simply monetary bonuses given to employees in addition to their regular pay. These are some of the most common additional compensation bonuses provided by employers: Sales commissions Performance awards (whether individual, department, or company-wide) Lump sum gifts (for outstanding actions, holidays, etc.) Stock options Profit sharing Although everyone loves a little bonus every now and then, there are some arguments against compensation employee bonuses. The biggest issue with monetary benefits is that it could spur unethical behavior and hinder teamwork. For example, if a salesperson knows they can earn more money if they perform well, they might be tempted to steal prospects from their coworkers. Not only does this hurt team morale, but it also makes your company look unprofessional. Before implementing additional compensation work benefits, it‚Äôs a good idea to clearly outline the bonus policy and give everyone the same opportunity for bonuses. The more transparent, the better. A little competition is good, but unhealthy competition can hurt your work environment. Work/life balance benefits The elusive work/life balance has been a touchy subject for employers and employees for decades. It‚Äôs a fine line between optimizing productivity and giving your employees enough time outside of work to do the things they love. Work/life balance benefits are perks designed to help your employees get out of the office to spend more time doing what they enjoy. The most common work/life balance benefit is paid time off (PTO). Almost 80% of private industry employees have access to PTO vacation leave. Although U.S. employers aren‚Äôt required to offer paid vacation leave, it can be a great way to give your business a competitive advantage when it comes to hiring and retention. If a potential applicant sees that your company offers more PTO compared to the competition, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll choose to work for you, even if the pay isn‚Äôt quite equal. Plus, if you give your employees enough paid time off throughout the year, they won‚Äôt get burned out, increasing happiness rates. And happy employees increase your business‚Äôs retention rates and boost overall productivity. Since PTO can be pricey for employers (in terms of both money and productivity), many employers are starting to offer work-from-home options as a part of their work/life balance benefits. Hybrid work models have grown in popularity for a few nears now¬†with some days per week in the office and others working remotely. Working from home gives your employees the freedom to build a work/life balance that works for them without sacrificing productivity, since they can still work. Other types of work/life employee benefits include parental leave, bereavement, training days, and sabbaticals. Legally mandated work benefits While there are dozens and dozens of employee benefits employers can choose to offer, there are a few benefits employers are required to provide by law. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS): ‚ÄúLegally required benefits provide workers and their families with retirement income and medical care, mitigate economic hardships resulting from loss of work and disability, and cover liabilities resulting from workplace injuries and illnesses.‚Äù Under BLS laws, there are four legally mandated work benefits: Social Security and Medicare Workers‚Äô compensation insurance Unemployment insurance Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) protections Any applicable employer with full-time employees is required to provide at least these four work benefits. Social Security and Medicare Social Security and Medicare are both considered legally required employee benefits. As such, it‚Äôs mandatory for employers to withhold a 6.2% Social Security tax from employee‚Äôs gross compensation up to the Social Security wage base. These funds are added to the Social Security program, which the employee can draw upon when they reach retirement age. It acts as a mandatory federal retirement plan. Similarly, employers must also withhold a 1.45% Medicare tax, with additional withholding rules depending on employee‚Äôs income. Medicare is a federal healthcare program that people are eligible for once they reach retirement age. Workers‚Äô compensation insurance If a worker can no longer perform their duties after an injury on the job, workers‚Äô compensation covers the medical bills and a portion of their wages until they‚Äôre physically fit enough to go back to work. Employers are required to maintain some level of workers‚Äô compensation insurance to protect their employees from the financial burden of potential on-the-job injuries. Most state requirements for unemployment insurance benefits can be met either through self insurance or state-run programs: Self-insurance ‚Äì The employer agrees to pay for medical bills and income directly in the event of a workplace injury or illness. If you choose this option, you must prove your business has the financial resources necessary to cover potential payouts. State-run programs ‚Äì Employers can purchase a workers‚Äô compensation insurance policy from the state. The employer pays a monthly fee based on the number of employees, and the insurance pays out in the event of a workplace injury or illness. Unemployment insurance Unemployment insurance assists workers who lose their jobs. Workers may file for unemployment to get financial assistance and temporary benefits during transition periods after being fired or laid off if they meet specific criteria. Employers are required to contribute to unemployment insurance when processing payroll taxes to protect their workers if they ever become unemployed. Each state has different requirements for employer contributions, so make sure you understand the minimum coverage regulations in your area. Basic healthcare protections Because healthcare is such a major cost in the U.S., employers are required to provide a minimum level of healthcare coverage to employees. Applicable large employers (ALEs), which are typically companies with an average of 50 or more full-time employees (including equivalents), must offer adequate and affordable medical coverage for their employees. The specific policies and coverages are up to the employer, but the employee must not pay more than a specific percentage of their income for premiums. Employees should also have access to a reasonable network of healthcare providers, and the plan should cover at least 60% of the cost of medical services. These basic coverages are called the ‚Äúminimum value standard.‚Äù Employers are also required to provide unpaid, job-protected leave for specific medical and family reasons under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). According to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), employers must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per 12-month period for family and medical reasons that qualify, like a chronic personal illness, birth of a child, or caring for immediate family member with a chronic or serious illness. Most common (and best) employee work benefits Although employers are welcome to offer any type of employee benefits they want (as long as they meet the federally required benefits), some benefits are more common than others in the workplace. Here are the top ten most common employee work benefits in the U.S.: Private healthcare plan (medical, dental, and vision) Retirement and/or pension plans Training and development benefits Stock options Flexible hours and work from home time Life insurance In-office food and snacks Extended leave (including vacation and sick days) Monetary bonuses, awards, and gifts Company equipment (computer, phone, vehicle, etc.) If you‚Äôre wondering which employee benefits are the best, most employees value any and all benefits. There aren‚Äôt any specific benefits that are inherently better than others. But typically, the better the benefits you offer, the higher-quality candidates you attract and the lower your turnover rates. Average employer costs According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, employee benefits accounted for 31% of total employer compensation costs in 2022. In some cases, the cost of health benefits alone can reach up to $15,000 annually per employee! While that might seem like a lot (and it is), these benefits are essential if you want to maintain a high-quality workforce. Providing employee benefits does cost your company money, but there are creative ways to lower the cost without hindering your ability to remain competitive or maintain your workforce. For example, allowing remote or flexible work schedules doesn‚Äôt cost your business much money and still provides your employees with the work/life balance they crave. And never underestimate the power of free lunches or snacks! All over the country, employers are getting creative with their benefits to remain competitive without hurting their bottom line. Here are just a few cost-effective benefits to make your employees happy: Public transit cards or reimbursements for travel expenses, including tolls and gas Company-sponsored discounts for local restaurants, coffee places, gyms, childcare, etc. Free or designated parking spaces Cell phone plans Extra time off for volunteering or training Wellness resources like first-aid training, standing desks, ergonomic keyboards, etc. The only limit to the benefits you can offer your employees is your imagination! And remember, employee benefits don‚Äôt entirely count as a cost; they‚Äôre an investment. If you provide sufficient benefits to your employees, it can increase morale, generate productivity, and boost retention rates ‚Äî all of which will help your company save money in the long run. Employee benefits management best practices It‚Äôs not easy for your HR team to monitor and maintain all the various employee benefits offered by your company ‚Äî especially when government regulations are involved. To reduce the possibility of errors and limit the strain on your HR team, follow these employee benefits management best practices: Hire a specialist ‚Äì It‚Äôs less likely for details to fall through the cracks if someone is dedicated to a task. If you don‚Äôt already, it‚Äôs important to hire a dedicated employee benefits specialist to help you find the best options for your company, monitor costs, implement new policies, ensure compliance, and even negotiate prices for some benefits. Stay on top of costs ‚Äì The cost of employee benefits is rarely static. Make sure your HR team is on top of costs and whether the changing costs are worth the investment over time. Monitoring essential data will help you maintain a successful benefits strategy in the long term. Use the right software ‚Äì Modern business is all about finding the right software to suit your needs. With a little technological help, you can simplify HR processes and keep a sharper eye on the minor details that come along with employee benefits. Include benefit information in your employee handbook ‚Äì Employees need to know about the benefits if they‚Äôre going to use and enjoy them. Make sure everyone on your team understands the benefits they have access to by clearly outlining all your benefits in the employee handbook. Talk to your employees ‚Äì Needs (and wants) change over time. Regularly talk to your employees to see what benefits they want. Your benefits package might change over time to suit your employees‚Äô or the worlds‚Äô changing desires. Employee benefits bring business benefits Providing benefits for employees isn‚Äôt an unnecessary cost for your business; it‚Äôs an investment in your workforce. If you can provide your team with benefits beyond their standard paycheck, it gives them the feeling that the company actually cares about them and their lives, increasing retention rates, bringing in the best quality candidates, and boosting morale and productivity. It‚Äôs easy to see how providing basic benefits to your employees can ‚Äúbenefit‚Äù your business. When you care for your team, your team will care about your business.

What are the top 5 sourcing techniques? What is the difference between active and passive recruiting? What is sourcing vs recruiting? Conclusion Understanding Active Sourcing and Its Importance The world of recruitment has seen a significant shift from the traditional 'post-and-pray' approach to a more proactive one, called active sourcing . But what exactly is it? The Definition and Role of Active Sourcing In simple terms, active sourcing is the strategic hunt for qualified candidates rather than waiting for them to apply. This strategy aims at building relationships with potential talents before an open position even exists. Apart from filling vacancies faster, active sourcing allows hiring managers to build a talent pipeline - ensuring they have desirable candidates lined up for future roles. The Efficiency of Active Sourcing Facts don't lie; sourced candidates are over two times as efficient as those who simply apply. In fact, on average only 1 in every 72 sourced applicants gets hired. A sizable portion indeed when you compare it against traditional methods where hundreds may apply but not fit the outlined candidate profile . This means less time sifting through unqualified applications and more time spent engaging skilled workers who can bring value to your organization immediately after their job offer acceptance. Strategies for Effective Active Sourcing Active sourcing is more than just posting a job and waiting. It's about getting out there, actively seeking the best talent to fill your open positions . This can be done through various sourcing strategies, each tailored to suit your company's unique needs. Utilizing Employee Networks Your employees are already brand ambassadors who can play an integral role in widening the talent pool . By turning current employees into active participants in your referral program, you'll have access to potential candidates from their networks too. A study by LeverTRM , found that organizations could expand their talent pool 10 times simply by recruiting through their employees' networks. This method of proactive recruitment lets companies tap into a sizable portion of the job market they may not otherwise reach. Engaging Previously Declined Candidates You've probably had talented potential workers apply but weren't quite right for the position at hand. But don't discard these candidate profiles . Instead, keep them within arm‚Äôs reach as part of an outlined candidate persona strategy because they might be perfect for future roles. This approach makes sure no skilled worker falls through cracks and keeps doors open for those who postpone career decisions or seek jobs later on. Remember: today's runner-up might be tomorrow's superstar hire. Building a Strong Employer Brand for Active Sourcing Your employer brand is like the North Star in your active sourcing journey. It guides potential candidates towards you and gives them reasons to stay. A strong employer brand can be an effective magnet, attracting top talents who are seeking jobs. The Role of Employer Branding in Active Sourcing In this competitive job market, simply having open positions isn't enough to attract qualified candidates . You need something more‚Äîa positive corporate image that makes talented potential workers want to join your ranks. This is where employer branding comes into play. It's about painting an attractive picture of what it's like working at your company‚Äîhow you treat employees, opportunities for career growth, the work culture‚Äîall these factors influence a candidate‚Äôs decision whether or not to accept a job offer from you. Did you know? Organizations investing in employer branding are three times more likely to make quality hires. And if that wasn‚Äôt convincing enough - such investment also cuts turnover by 28%. If done right, a good employer brand will help turn current employees into brand ambassadors ‚Äì they become living testimonials of why others should aspire to work with you too. The ripple effect here could greatly expand your talent pool and significantly boost referral program results. To sum up: An alluring employer branding strategy doesn't just bring desirable candidates‚Äîit keeps them too. So start polishing yours today; let it shine brightly across the industry sky. Engaging and Attracting Suitable Candidates A vital aspect of active sourcing is engaging with potential candidates , making sure they find your company attractive. A well-crafted job offer plays a crucial role in this process. Crafting Compelling Job Offers To attract the best-skilled workforce to fill an open position , you need more than just a simple job description . An enticing job offer starts by understanding the candidate persona - their needs, desires, and career decisions. Remember that talented potential workers are not only looking for competitive salaries but also opportunities for growth and development. Your company's brand should reflect positively on its corporate image as it helps turn current employees into brand ambassadors who will be keen on referring qualified candidates . It's worth noting that over 60% of candidates check company reviews and ratings before deciding if they're interested in a job at all. Also consider offering monetary rewards or non-monetary incentives through an employee referral program; these can help increase interest among both actively seeking jobs individuals as well as passive ones. In today‚Äôs challenging job market where skills gap is growing wider every day, focusing on soft skills required might give you access to a sizable portion of desirable candidates others overlook because they focus solely on hard industry knowledge requirements. The Power of Passive Candidates in Active Sourcing Passive candidates can be a gold mine for active sourcing strategies . They are the hidden talents, often overlooked because they're not actively seeking jobs. Yet, these individuals hold great potential. As per Hiretual's research Hiretual , only 36% of the workforce is on an active job hunt at any given time, but an astounding 90% are open to discussing new opportunities. Leveraging LinkedIn for Passive Candidate Sourcing Social media platforms like LinkedIn play a pivotal role in tapping into this pool of passive talent. They allow hiring managers to identify and connect with professionals who may not currently be searching but could be enticed by the right job offer. This proactive recruitment strategy lets you meet applicants' expectations even before they know what those might be. In fact, building your company's brand as attractive employers through such channels turns current employees into brand ambassadors ‚Äì referring qualified candidates from their networks - without needing sizable monetary rewards or non-monetary incentives. Maximizing Active Sourcing with Technology Tools Active sourcing is a proactive approach to finding top talent . Without the appropriate technology, finding top talent can be a daunting task. Let's look at how tech can assist in improving our search for top talent . The Role of AI in Active Sourcing Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an essential tool in active sourcing . AI doesn't just speed up the process; it also improves its accuracy by using algorithms that analyze candidate profiles and match them with job requirements. It‚Äôs kind of like having your very own digital Sherlock Holmes. The Value of Data-Driven Decision Making Data-driven decision making is another game-changer in active sourcing . This involves collecting data on everything from candidate skills to industry trends, which helps inform our strategies and decisions. No need for guesswork here. By analyzing this information we're not only able to identify desirable candidates but also anticipate market shifts ‚Äì essentially becoming hiring soothsayers. So next time you think about manually scouring LinkedIn or other social media sites for potential hires - consider investing instead in tech tools that will automate these tasks and let you focus on what really matters: connecting with people. Trends Shaping the Future of Active Sourcing As we venture into the future, active sourcing is taking on new shapes and forms. Innovations are constantly transforming how hiring managers tap into their talent pipeline to fill open positions with qualified candidates . The rise of social media as a tool for sourcing strategies is notable. LinkedIn , in particular, has become an invaluable platform for identifying potential candidates who might not be actively seeking jobs but could be lured by a compelling job offer. A LinkedIn study suggests that a sizable portion of talents share career decisions here before anywhere else. A focus on soft skills required for each role now takes precedence alongside technical abilities when building an outlined candidate profile . This shift ensures companies attract more rounded individuals capable of adapting quickly to changing industry trends. To meet applicants' expectations better and make the company attractive, there's been a surge in offering monetary rewards or non-monetary incentives through employee referral programs. Not only does this help acquire skilled workers from trusted sources but also helps turn current employees into brand ambassadors boosting positive corporate image. Beyond these practices though lies one significant trend - proactive recruitment even without immediate vacancies to fill up. This approach keeps organizations ahead in securing the best-skilled workforce while preventing them from scrambling when gaps suddenly appear due to unforeseen circumstances like resignations or retirements.

The best five techniques include leveraging employee networks, re-engaging declined candidates, building a strong employer brand , creating compelling job offers and using professional platforms like LinkedIn .
