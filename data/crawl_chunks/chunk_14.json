The senior living industry has a turnover rate of 50% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics— and this number is quickly rising (source: CNBC ). To put this figure into better perspective, if your facility has 1,000 residents, you need to hire 500 new employees every year to maintain the status quo. This high employee turnover rate is very detrimental to businesses, causing the following: Burnout : Employees are overworked because facilities can't keep up with hiring. When assisted living employees leave suddenly, the remaining staff has to pick up additional shifts and training duties. Decrease in revenue : It costs centers $3,500 to $5,000 per hire when you factor in job board costs, onboarding, and training. Negative impact on employee culture : Employees are happier when they work with people they are familiar with. If there is a continuous cycle of people leaving, it can make for a stressful work environment. Lack of consistency of care: Residents are more at ease being cared for by those they know. Constant changeover of staff can be very emotionally disruptive for assisted living residents. Drop in the quality of care : When employees leave, they need to train their replacements; some tasks will fall through the cracks, resulting in lower quality of care. So what are the factors that often lead to high turnover numbers? Challenging workload Working at assisted living facilities can be both physically and emotionally taxing. The daily tasks are hard enough. Add the inevitable burnout due to the lack of staff, and the fact that employees often get emotionally attached to their assigned residents. Low pay Hourly workers at assisted living facilities receive relatively low pay considering the tiring nature of their work. Nursing assistants can get paid around $12 per hour , with nurses faring a bit better at $20. According to a survey performed by Indeed , Half of all employees at assisted living facilities believe they are not paid fairly. The low pay rate has driven many workers to seek more roles elsewhere in the healthcare industry. Lack of career growth Entry-level workers can struggle to break into senior ranks of employment in the senior care industry, particularly if there is a lack of training or other investment by the facility. Lack of staff development programs can be detrimental to an employee’s sense of belonging, leading to apathy among staff. Offering opportunities for career growth, as well as increasing engagement, can lead to better retention. Read more on how to drive employee engagement in this post . Very competitive labor market As of August 2019, there were roughly 39,000 job openings posted by direct employers in the senior living industry, including those for assisted living facilities. Given the abundance of opportunities, workers feel less apprehensive going elsewhere when they feel unsatisfied with their current employment. Given the urgent need in the industry and the stiff competition for hiring in the field, it’s more important than ever to focus on the right screening process. Employee retention starts at the very first step of recruitment: making sure to find competent, dedicated candidates to match the qualifications of each job opening you post. Workstream is committed to streamlining and automating recruitment strategies so that every employer can get the best solutions for different hiring challenges. Workstream has helped hire thousands of assisted living employees and care drivers for companies including Brightstar, Morrison Living, Nurse Next Door, Envoy, and Clarion Medical Transport.

Tracking the right metrics is the best way to determine which of your locations might need extra help, identify potential bottlenecks, double down on successful sourcing strategies, and more. Explore eight crucial hiring metrics that every recruiting professional should keep an eye on to optimize their hiring experience. 1. Time-to-hire: A holistic view of your hiring experience Time-to-hire is the number one metric that all recruiting professionals should track. It measures the time taken to fill a job vacancy from when it opens to when an applicant accepts the offer. This metric gives you a holistic view of your hiring experience, highlighting the efficiency of your recruitment process. Speed is crucial, especially when hiring hourly workers. Research has shown that the success or failure of hiring hourly workers is heavily correlated with how quickly they are brought on board. The longer you take to respond, the higher the chance they might accept another offer by the time you reach out to them. Aim to streamline your hiring process to minimize time-to-hire and secure the best talent. 2. Interacted with or not: Prompt response matters Another important hiring metric is whether hiring managers have responded to an applicant and, if so, how quickly. Nothing is more frustrating for job seekers than applying for a position and then waiting days or weeks before hearing back from an employer. To ensure a positive candidate experience, strive to respond promptly. According to HRDive , 80% of respondents wanted faster response times from recruiters. A third said they had quit applying for jobs because of slow response time from recruiters, and they are most likely to accept an offer from the company that responds to them first. Our research shows a 25% greater chance of hiring when employers contact applicants within an hour of receiving the application. Consider automating some aspects of the process, such as setting up automated application filtering and enabling applicants to self-schedule interviews to speed up response times and improve candidate engagement. 3. Time spent in stages: Applicant experience While time-to-hire provides an overall perspective on your hiring efficiency, it's a good idea to do a deeper dive and find out how much time is spent on each stage of the hiring process. Holding applicants in a hiring stage too long can leave a bad impression and cause them to begin looking for opportunities elsewhere. Ideally, the hiring process should take no more than a day or two at each stage. Lengthy delays can lead to applicant drop-offs, reducing the overall quality of your talent pool. Remember that hourly workers, in particular, are actively seeking immediate job opportunities. Therefore, investing in automation and streamlining stages can significantly improve your chances of attracting and hiring the best hourly talent. 4. Hiring performance by source: Maximizing sourcing strategies Sourcing new applicants can be a time and energy-consuming process. By tracking the performance of different sourcing strategies , you can identify what's working and what strategies can be discarded. Review results based on job boards, recruitment agencies , social media, and other sources to determine what tactic yields the most qualified and engaged applicants. If you notice that specific sources, such as physical posters outside your front door, attract more engaged applicants, consider reallocating resources to focus more on those channels . Using text-to-apply features, QR codes, or even hiring posters may be more effective in reaching your ideal candidates. 5. Hiring performance by position: Tailoring hiring strategies Every position within your organization may have unique hiring challenges. Tracking the time-to-hire for each role will help you identify if certain positions need extra attention. This data can inform your future hiring strategy for those roles. For instance, if cashiers typically take an average of two weeks to hire, don't build a hiring timeline with the expectation that you can fill the role in one week. Understanding the hiring patterns for different positions will enable you to set realistic expectations and optimize your recruitment efforts accordingly. 6. Offer acceptance rate: Evaluating your attractiveness to candidates Offer acceptance rate is a critical metric that indicates how compelling your job offers are to candidates. A low acceptance rate may signify uncompetitive compensation, unappealing company culture, or an overly lengthy hiring process. Research market salaries and benefits for similar roles to improve your offer acceptance rate. The Hourly Wage Index is a free tool that can help you compare wage rates in just a couple of clicks.  You can also consider interviewing existing employees to identify areas for improvement in the work environment. Additionally, streamline your hiring process to reduce the time between the interview and the offer. 7. Quality of hire: Assessing long-term success Tracking the quality of hire metric helps you assess how well new employees perform and contribute to your organization in the long run. Evaluating employee performance, job satisfaction, and retention rates can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of your hiring process. To measure quality of hire, consider using employee performance reviews, manager assessments, and retention data. Use this information to identify trends and patterns that can be linked back to the hiring process. This metric will help you fine-tune your recruitment strategies to attract candidates who best fit your company culture and job requirements. 8. Cost per hire: Managing recruitment budget Cost per hire is a crucial metric for understanding the financial efficiency of your hiring process. It includes the total expenses incurred in the recruitment process, from advertising to onboarding. You can identify cost-saving opportunities and optimize your recruitment budget by tracking the cost per hire. Consider investing in cost-effective sourcing methods, such as employee referrals or social media recruiting . Additionally, streamline administrative tasks through automation to reduce the time and resources spent on manual processes. Improve your hiring process with the right data Tracking hiring metrics is essential for perfecting your hiring process and attracting the best workers to your organization. Utilize data-driven insights to identify areas for improvement, streamline your recruitment process, and make informed decisions to build a strong and engaged workforce. Speed, prompt communication, personalized strategies, and financial efficiency are key to winning over top applicants, especially in competitive hourly job markets. With these hiring hacks in place, you can elevate your hiring game and stay ahead in the race for talent.

Share this article Hiring analytics can be your trusty compass in navigating through uncharted waters. It's a blend of data-driven recruitment and predictive analytics , giving you valuable insights on everything from improving candidate experience to identifying skill gaps. If your goal is efficient business operations with quality hires while keeping hiring costs optimized then we are about to embark on an insightful journey into the world of advanced reporting and operational efficiency. I promise you this; by the end of our voyage, you'll not only grasp the key metrics in recruitment processes but also predict future hiring trends using historical data . Let's dive right in. Understanding Hiring Analytics Hiring analytics is the compass guiding HR departments through a sea of recruitment data . It's about turning raw numbers into actionable insights that can improve business operations and make hiring decisions . A whopping 71% of companies see talent analytics as a top priority, and it's easy to see why. Applicant tracking systems , for instance, are indispensable tools in hiring analytics. They help collect crucial data on applicant demographics, time-to-hire metrics , and more. The benefits of this approach are numerous: quicker decision-making processes; increased accuracy when predicting future trends; enhanced understanding of candidate behavior patterns - all leading to better hires overall. The best part? Data-driven hiring doesn't just enhance your current recruitment process but also sets you up for long-term success by identifying areas needing improvement. Data allows us to peek into the future too. With enough historical information at hand, we can predict upcoming industry changes or shifts in job market demands – enabling proactive responses instead of reactive ones. This means staying ahead in today’s competitive landscape and landing better new hires that lead to better retention . The Power Behind Key Metrics In the realm of hiring analytics, key metrics serve as vital signposts along our journey towards improved outcomes. By focusing on elements like acceptance rate or completion rate within an application process, we gain deeper insight into how potential candidates interact with our brand throughout their journey. This knowledge enables businesses not only to optimize their strategies but also pinpoint where they might be losing high-quality applicants along the way – thus opening doors for targeted improvements. We're talking about a serious game-changer in the HR landscape. Data-driven hiring , when executed correctly, leads to better recruitment outcomes and ultimately a stronger company. Key Takeaway: By tapping into the power of hiring analytics, you can transform raw recruitment data into actionable insights . This helps your HR team fine-tune operations and make smarter hires. Tools like applicant tracking systems are key in gathering crucial information, enabling businesses to anticipate trends and comprehend candidate behavior. When you adopt this proactive approach, it becomes easier to adapt to industry shifts, tweak strategies according to essential metrics , spot areas that need improvement in your hiring process and ultimately enhance overall recruitment results. The Role of Recruitment Analytics in the Hiring Process Ever wonder how recruitment analytics shape the hiring process ? Think of it as a fortune teller, gazing into its crystal ball - except that this soothsayer uses data. A customized approach to hiring, powered by predictive analytics , can be a game-changer. Predictive decision-making isn't about pulling rabbits out of hats. It's more like using historical data to forecast future trends, just like weather forecasting . For instance, imagine being able to predict future hiring needs and budget accordingly; wouldn't that be a hiring manager ’s dream come true? Moreover, having real-time insights into your recruitment funnel is no less than striking gold in the world of talent acquisition . By tracking key metrics such as completion rate or acceptance rate within this funnel, bottlenecks become apparent and areas for improvement are highlighted. Talk about turning lead into gold. Analyzing the Recruitment Funnel through Key Metrics In every fairy tale there’s always someone with a magic mirror answering questions and providing valuable advice. In our case, that ‘someone’ is recruitment analytics offering valuable insights on improving candidate experience . No need for enchanted mirrors when you have data at your disposal. Every step from application received to job offer accepted becomes quantifiable. But here’s where we separate Cinderellas from stepsisters: successful companies don’t just gather data—they use them strategically. Leveraging these metrics makes effective recruitment strategies possible—a far cry better than relying on tea leaves or tarot cards. That way you're not simply playing darts blindfolded but aiming precisely based on solid information. Collecting and Analyzing Recruitment Data Let's cut to the chase: Performance management software is your golden ticket when it comes to collecting recruitment data . These tools let you easily get important information like candidate performance, helping make sense of a sea of applicants. You may ask why this matters? Let me tell you - gathering data on candidates who didn't apply can be as tricky as herding cats. But with these advanced reporting techniques in hand, even such seemingly elusive tasks become doable. This makes us recall an interesting fact: The quality of raw data determines the quality of insights we can draw from it. Just think about baking a cake; if you use top-notch ingredients (data), your cake (insights) is likely to turn out fantastic. Analyzing Candidate Performance Data Data collection without analysis is like cooking without tasting—you won't know how good or bad it is until someone else tries it first—and by then, it might be too late. To prevent such situations from happening in our hiring process , analyzing collected data becomes crucially important. And trust me—nothing beats advanced reporting techniques when doing so. Metrics and Analytics for Effective Recruitment Understanding key metrics in recruitment like the completion rate, acceptance rate, offer acceptance, and hiring costs is a game-changer. These are the lifelines that keep your recruitment process healthy and efficient. A deeper look into workforce analytics can help you identify skill gaps. It's not about just filling positions anymore but finding people who fit perfectly like puzzle pieces into your organization. Using Analytics to Improve Quality of Hire In an ideal world where all hires turn out to be rockstars at their job, we wouldn't need hiring analytics. But reality begs to differ. 71% of companies see talent analytics as a top priority because it helps them improve the quality of hire . You may ask - how? Well here’s something surprising: data doesn’t lie. With robust analysis methods such as measuring completion rates or analyzing offer acceptance rates , one can glean valuable insights about candidates even before they step through our doors. Hiring Costs: The dollars spent on getting new employees onboard often go unnoticed but make up a significant part of business expenses. Completion Rate: This measures what percentage of applicants complete each stage in your application process – giving insight on which stages might need tweaking. Acceptance Rate & Offer Acceptance: This tells us if our offers are being accepted more often than not; hinting at whether we’re hitting (or missing) market expectations with compensation packages or role responsibilities. Analyzing these metrics gives us invaluable knowledge needed for creating effective strategies - ones that ensure high-quality hires while optimizing cost and time. Employer Branding and Hiring Analytics An employer's brand is not just about the company logo or tagline. It's the perception candidates have when they hear your company name. And guess what? Glassdoor states that a strong employer brand can cut cost per hire by half. So, it's time we let data guide us to make our brands even better. Leveraging Analytics to Enhance Candidate Satisfaction The first step in improving your brand with hiring analytics involves analyzing job descriptions with data. Data-driven decisions help tailor these descriptions to attract quality candidates. This strategy goes hand-in-hand with candidate satisfaction tracking, another crucial aspect of recruitment analytics . Satisfied applicants are more likely to accept job offers - it sounds simple because it is. A look at key metrics like offer acceptance rates reveals valuable insights into how well an organization’s branding resonates with potential hires. Remember: The goal isn't only for them to apply but also for them to join. But don’t forget – maintaining a stellar reputation requires work beyond making job offers accepted by high-quality talent. Data science is complex and requires clean data for accurate insights. Hiring MetricAverage Rate (%)Candidate Acceptance Rate (CAR)N/A* Offer Acceptance Rate (OAR)N/A* *These values depend on industry benchmarks and internal factors such as compensation packages, company culture, and more. Recruitment analytics can help create diverse and inclusive hiring practices. Let's pay close attention to the tales these numbers tell. So let’s listen to them carefully. Future Trends in Hiring Analytics As we look ahead, it's clear that hiring analytics will play an even more crucial role in shaping the future of recruitment. As technology progresses, the reliance on data-based choices is becoming increasingly common and predictive analytics are taking a prominent role. The evolution of recruiting analytics has opened up new possibilities for predicting future hiring needs. In fact, historical data helps predict these needs accurately. But remember, like any evolving field, its success lies as much with the science behind it as with using big numbers. Predictive analysis lets us make sense of complex patterns from past hires to forecast what kind of talent a company might need down the line. It's not just about filling open positions now—it’s also about anticipating skill gaps and planning accordingly. The Impact Of AI And Automation On Hiring Processes No discussion on future trends would be complete without acknowledging how artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing our traditional methods - speeding up processes while minimizing human bias through automation where possible. AI-powered hiring tools can now sift through thousands of applications in a fraction of the time it would take a human, helping HR teams focus more on creating impactful candidate experiences . This isn't just about making life easier for recruiters—it's also about enhancing employer branding by ensuring every application is given due consideration and improving overall satisfaction levels among applicants. So here’s to data-driven recruitment . Key Takeaway: And planning for tomorrow. We need to consider not only what skills we're short on today, but also the ones that will be critical in the future. Using hiring analytics and AI, we can make informed decisions about our talent needs—faster and without bias. This isn't just a trend—it's how we shape a more strategic, successful recruitment process . FAQs in Relation to Hiring Analytics How is analytics used in recruiting?

So, go ahead and get your Understanding Hiring Management Software Hiring management software , also known as applicant tracking systems ( ATS ), is a crucial tool in modern recruitment. These platforms streamline the hiring process and significantly reduce manual work for recruiters. The Role of Applicant Tracking Systems An ATS is like the central nervous system of your hiring strategy. It's designed to efficiently track candidates from sourcing to onboarding . But it does more than just store resumes; it can automatically screen applications, schedule interviews, and even manage job postings across various boards. This automation not only saves time but also helps maintain consistency throughout the recruitment process - ensuring every candidate has an equal opportunity regardless of when they applied or who reviews their application. Importance of Skill Assessments A good hiring management software doesn't stop at tracking applicants; it dives deeper into assessing them too. Integrated skill assessments help you identify suitable candidates effectively by evaluating competencies relevant to each role before conducting any interviews. Beyond saving time during screening stages, these assessments give insights that assist with interview preparation and decision-making processes later down the line. In essence, a well-equipped recruiting tool offers comprehensive support right from posting a job opening up until finalizing a hire. This not only ensures seamless talent acquisition but also elevates candidate experience - setting a positive employer brand image from the get-go. Remember: The key features may vary based on individual business needs, but overall this innovative solution aims at simplifying what could otherwise be an overwhelming task. Innovations in Hiring Management Software As the world of recruitment evolves, so does the technology that supports it. Innovations in hiring management software are revolutionizing how businesses source and select top talent . ClearCompany's Mobile-First Approach The advent of mobile technologies has transformed our lives, including how we apply for jobs. ClearCompany , a pioneer in this space, recognized this trend early on and developed an innovative text recruiting suite called ClearText. It leverages AI to streamline communication between recruiters and candidates. This mobile-first approach ensures efficient candidate sourcing by tapping into the ubiquitous nature of smartphones today. But its true genius lies in its ability to offer personalized experiences at scale—something every HR professional dreams about. Customizability with Monday.com Beyond AI-powered text messaging suites, customization is another game-changer within hiring management software tools. One company leading this wave is Monday.com. The platform offers pre-built templates allowing you to construct your own custom recruiting tool - flexible enough for small businesses yet scalable for larger organizations as well. This kind of adaptability lets each organization tailor their system according to their specific needs - whether they're staffing agencies seeking more streamlined interview scheduling or firms needing robust resume parsing capabilities. Surely these innovations show us one thing: the future of hiring isn't just about posting job ads online—it’s about using advanced tech like AI features integrated within platforms such as ClearCompany or customizable solutions offered by companies like Monday.com. The Role of Data Analytics in Hiring Management Software Data analytics plays a pivotal role in hiring management software . Data analytics provides businesses with the ability to make well-informed decisions in terms of talent acquisition by streamlining recruitment procedures. Incorporating robust data analysis offers comparative values across different areas of your hiring strategy. Such information can help identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies within your current approach and guide you towards making necessary improvements. This is not just about number crunching; it’s about giving businesses valuable insights into what works best for them during the recruiting process , thereby enhancing productivity while saving time and resources simultaneously. Tapping Into The Power Of Recruitment Benchmarking Data Benchmarking isn't simply comparing numbers but involves using collected data as a standard against which performance measures are gauged over time – allowing recruiters to compare themselves both internally (over various periods) and externally (against industry averages). All these powerful features rolled together contribute significantly towards shaping an efficient hiring workflow that matches talented candidates with suitable job openings quickly yet effectively - proving how crucial the role of data analytics is within any good quality hiring management software . The Impact of Social Media Tools in Hiring Management Software When we think about the hiring process , traditional methods like job postings and career sites may come to mind. However, social media has revolutionized the recruitment of talented individuals. Social recruiting isn't just about posting job openings on different channels though; it's also an excellent way to build your employer brand . By sharing engaging content related to your company culture or showcasing employee experiences, you can attract more qualified applicants who align with your values. Leveraging Candidate Data Through Social Recruiting An often overlooked benefit is how much valuable data you can gather through social recruiting efforts using sophisticated applicant tracking systems ( ATS ). Every interaction – whether it’s liking a post or responding to job ads – gives insights into what attracts people towards your company and which messages resonate best with them. With this knowledge at hand, you're better equipped to refine future recruitment marketing campaigns effectively making every effort count. So, the question isn't whether to integrate social media into your hiring management software but how you can best utilize it to attract top talent and make your recruitment process more efficient. Key Takeaway: Managing Relationships : This lets you stay on top of all interactions with candidates, no matter the platform - all from one central hub. Got questions or...

This means filtering through hundreds, if not thousands of resumes, until you finally find a candidate who seems to fit the requirements of the team. Initial interviews may have been scheduled, but you (or the team) now realized that they aren’t not suitable after all. This leads to the big question: how to tell someone they didn't get the job? The goal of this blog post is to serve as a valuable resource to help hiring managers and recruiters with how to tell someone they didn't get the job. We'll also discuss why it's important to provide a rejection email for a job, how long to wait to send the rejection email after the interview, and how to tell someone they didn't get the job in the most productive way. How do you politely tell someone they didn't get the job? Simply ghosting the job candidate may seem like an ideal (and easy) way out, and this is also the path that many companies often take. However, the lack of follow-up after an application, be it to provide an offer or rejection, may end up leading applicants on, and give a false sense of hope. More often than not, a lack of response to candidates can leave a bad impression and even spark negative word-of-mouth about your organization. You’re only as saught after as your company’s reputation and properly telling a candidate they didn’t get the job is the first step in setting up your companies image. But we recommend another way to frame the question, \"How to tell someone they didn't get the job?\" How would you want to be told that you didn't get a job ? It may seem simple to say that the golden rule replies to this situation just as it applies to so many others, but it's still a valuable way to re-frame the challenge of how to tell someone they didn't get the job. Most HR professionals would agree that the right way on how to tell someone they didn't get the job is by sending them a rejection letter . Sometimes a phone call may suffice but more often than not, a rejection letter is the way to go. It allows you to carefully tailor the bad news with positive constructive feedback and, if the candidate was adequate, you can mention that they could be strong candidates for future job openings . Luckily, these rejection emails aren't something that you need to write from scratch, and can be templated to make the process as simple as possible. Below you'll find tips on how to write a rejection letter and even an applicant rejection letter template for you! Why Write a Job Rejection Letter? When it comes to the right and wrong way how to tell someone they didn't get the job, it's important to realize the effects of a \"non-response.\" In this case, we’re referring to the lack of follow-ups after the interview, even though the candidate has already been deemed to be \"rejected\" internally. Frustration, impatience and a sense of false hope may accumulate, resulting in lasting negative sentiments towards your company. This may manifest in the form of a negative Glassdoor review, with the words \"terrible interview experience\" in the title. While this may be the worst case scenario, it is undeniable that many candidates expect some sort of reply from the company. Writing a job rejection letter helps to maintain a relationship with the applicant, who may potentially be a better fit for another team or role. With more experience and training, they may be suitable for future roles as well, and a positive recruitment experience will help in keeping them in the candidate pool. Most importantly, they will retain a good impression of your company. Candidates will also realize that you respect the effort they've put into applying for the role and preparing for the interview(s). At the same time, it also provides a form of closure , so that they are not left anticipating a callback, but can instead focus their efforts on other companies. This is especially so if they felt like they nailed the interview and stood a chance. Instead of waiting for them to follow up after the interview (and having an influx of follow up emails in your inbox), sending the rejection letter shows initiative and does not result in anticipation and disappointment thereafter. Furthermore, you will be able to preserve your employer brand . Remember that negative Glassdoor review we mentioned earlier? Studies have shown that 6 in 10 candidates will discuss their negative experience with the people around them, while 30% will discourage others from applying. This may in turn dissuade other qualified candidates from even applying to your company, which will reduce the candidate pool. Finally, rejection emails are also effective in keeping candidates as customers . If your brand is providing some sort of product or service, it is likely that these candidates are supporters of the product or service in the first place. Negative feelings towards the company may result in loss of support as they hold back on their purchases. The impact may even be amplified as many candidates are involved in the hiring process, which could lead to a drastic fall in profits or revenue when they are also lost as customers. Writing a Good Job Rejection Letter Writing a good job rejection letter is not as hard as you think it is! Here are some points you can (and should) include: Be Concise, and Swift Keep letters professional and to the point. Send them out as soon as you know that the applicant is not suitable for the role. \"Thank you\" The most important part of the rejection email - it is necessary to acknowledge their interest in your company, and the effort they've put into applying for the job, and complete the interview(s). It also emphasizes that you value their time. Personalization This step is crucial, especially if they were involved in at least one round of interviews. Include the applicant's name and the title of the position, as well as certain pointers brought up during the interview which reflected well on them. If they were not approved in the resume screening stage, you may also set up an automated rejection email, which will put your company ahead of many others. Feedback You may also choose to include feedback, such as how they could improve based on their interview, or what was lacking which resulted in them not making the cut. This would also be helpful in their future interviews, and candidates will definitely be appreciative of the feedback. However, do ensure that this is phrased in a gracious and careful manner, or it may come across as criticism which may end up being insulting to the candidate. Additionally, it's of the utmost importance that any feedback given is based solely around the candidate's answers and doesn't steer into subjective areas like \"professionalism.\" You want to avoid any possible appearance of bias, and at the same time offer valuable recommendations for the candidate to succeed in the future. Nebulous feedback isn't very helpful, and also potentially opens your company up to possible allegations of bias. To go the extra mile, you may even ask the candidate if they would like individual feedback. From my personal experience, the best hiring manager even offered to hop on a quick call and took the time to explain why I was not shortlisted for the particular role, which was heartwarming. Invitation to Apply Again If you see potential in a particular candidate, you may let them know that they can apply for other opportunities available, or keep in touch and contact you should they see other openings which may be of interest to them. Applicant Rejection Letter Template Here are some templates which you may consider sending to applicants: Rejection letter for an applicant who will not get an interview Dear <Applicant's First Name> , I would like to thank you for taking the time to apply for the <role title> at <company name> .

Early in his career, Lei helped build a sales recommendation engine that helped Google scale and optimize a sales team of several thousand, and was a management consultant for Fortune 500 companies at ZS Associates. Prior to Workstream, he was the co-founder and CTO of Emote, a Silicon Valley based edtech company funded by Y Combinator (S16), helping teachers to track, communicate, and support student emotions and behaviors. He shares with us his experiences in the hourly workspace, what challenges him, and sound advice for running a startup. Nicole (N): What is the main issue that inspired you to start working on Workstream? Lei (L): 60% of the US workforce is comprised of hourly workers, and with the rise of the gig economy, that number is only going to increase. Yet when you look at the landscape of HR and hiring software for the SMB and mid market companies, they are oftentimes dated and not focused on making it fast and easy to hire workers. With today's workforce becoming ever more mobile and connected, an employer needs to meet the applicants where they are to have a shot of attracting and keeping talent. When we landed on this key insight, it was simply inevitable to build Workstream to solve it, and it's been a fun journey along the way meeting tons of hard-working and passionate people. N: What professional accomplishments are you most proud of since you joined Workstream? L: I'm proud of the amazing customer success team that we've built at Workstream. Prior to Workstream, I had no experience on customer success, but we knew that for us to be successful, we need to lean in on our customers, really listen to them, so we can serve them well. Ultimately for the product to be successful, our team needs to be dialed in to the challenges that our customers are facing. We needed our first 100 customers to love using Workstream. Fast forward to today, we're still in the very early stages of building up customer success, but I'm proud to say we've laid down the foundation that will ensure our customers continue to be successful, and their voices continue to be heard. N: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. L: I've never held a job in retail, food, or hospitality - which I've now come to regret! Back in college, I worked in a variety of hourly jobs in research and customer service. One of the experiences I remember well was doing some very basic levels of \"equity research\" - which is a very fancy way of saying data scraping by reading PDFs, searching for information, and then copying it over to a spreadsheet. It taught me patience and also the fact that \"time is money.\" N: What is something you learned that you practice daily? L: Last month, I just revisited David Allen's popular framework for \"Getting Things Done\" or \"GTD.\" I first encountered it while at Google, where productivity and efficiency are highly celebrated traits. One key tenet of the GTD framework is that you shouldn't keep anything in your mind -- our minds are wonderful for processing information, but are terrible at storing and retrieving them. Rather, when anything that resembles a \"to-do\" item enters your inbox (whether it's take out the trash, or write the spec for the next feature), triage it, and put it onto a to-do list. When properly tagged, it helps tremendously in keeping my mind free of distractions and focused on the task at hand. N: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? L: I'm a sprinter when it comes to work, and I love to put my head down to get things done. The reality though is that in an early stage startup, there literally is an endless stream of ideas and things needing to be done, and it can quickly become overwhelming. For me, the biggest sustained challenge is to keep my head high and maintain a positive mindset through it all - because the difference in productivity and creativity between a \"good\" and \"bad\" day is night and day. I've tried a variety of techniques to help me stay sane during the marathon. Currently, it's a combination of meditation, exercise, to-do lists, and not taking my phone or computer into the bedroom. N: Who inspires you and why? L: I've just finished reading several memoirs / business books by Richard Branson (Finding My Virginity, The Virgin Way, Screw Business As Usual). I knew little about the man before, but his vigor towards life and work truly inspired me. A serial entrepreneur, he founded several successful businesses and ran them with passion and an authentic culture, decades before those were valued in Silicon Valley. Not one to turn down an adventure, he's had numerous near death experiences, and even at age 69, continues to be active and lead a daredevil lifestyle. I am deeply inspired by the vigor, passion, and curiosity he has towards life. N: You have an impressive career as former CTO of YC-backed SaaS company, Google engineer. What is one piece of advice that you would give someone who is running a startup? L: At YC, there is no shortage of people that give you valuable, sincere, and experience- or data-backed advice. I think out of all of them, the best one I heard was a meta advice that as a founder, your job is to figure out which advice to take, and which to ignore. Ultimately, that judgment is what marks the path that you will take. Okay, maybe another more tangible one. When I think about decisions, one framework that I've learned is to draw a 2x2 with impact and reversible-ness as the two axes. The 4 squares form a good heuristic on how much time and resources you should dedicate to making a decision. High impact, non reversible? Better be darn sure that it's the right thing to do. Low impact and reversible? Delegate. Learn more about our thought partners, investors, and respected entrepreneurs from our blog .

This is the only way to keep on the right path and find useful solutions for the industry.” Workstream is blessed in having ingenious, forward-thinking founders to drive its growth - and Max Wang is one of them. Always on the move between San Francisco, Beijing, and Wuhan, he is a serial startup founder who always seeks business opportunities to bridge America and Asia. Max started China's AngelList in 2011, built a 50+ people team, and grew to series A+. By doing that, he nurtured a strong network with other founders and engineering leaders in Asia, so he could quickly build a team of former CTOs at Workstream. Today, Max shares snippets that include why they created the Workstream platform, what motivates him, and other key takeaways from his years of experience. Nicole (N): What was the main issue that triggered you to start working on Workstream? Max (M):  Me and Desmond were building a global outsourcing platform in 2017. During that time, we realized that hiring is a huge pain point. By interviewing 100+ potential clients including HR head of Starbucks, founders of Coup Cafe, CEO of GoGoVan, head of Uber HongKong, HR head of GE, etc, we found that hiring hourly workers is an unsolved pain point and there is huge potential in that niche. So we decided to explore it and started building the first version. N: What professional accomplishments are you most proud of since you joined Workstream? M: We successfully built a remote engineering team covering 4 time zones. We explored a set of tools, team cultures, collaborating conventions, and hiring principles to facilitate the team architecture. Luckily it works well and the team is showing great momentum. N: How is this project challenging you? M: This is the first SaaS product I have built. Building a highly accessible product for thousands of different clients in one platform is a great engineering challenge. We keep pursuing better code quality and more flexible system architecture. This will be a long-term challenge along with our growth. Solving it in a good way will be a cornerstone of our overall success. N: What is something you learned that you practice daily? M: Repeating best practices is the best way to make progress and move things forward. N: What is the biggest challenge you have encountered in your career? M: When the resource is extremely limited, how to learn new and hard things as fast as possible and apply them in production bravely. N: Who inspires you and why? M: The whole team inspires me a lot. A key principle I learned in the past 8 years as a startup founder was that we should always find talents who have better expertise than us in some aspects. By doing this, I can always learn new things from everyone and everyone can learn from each other frequently. N: I know you Founded Asia’s AngelList and built a 50-person engineering team. What is one piece of advice that you will give someone who is running a startup? M: Keep talking to your customers/users. This is the only way to keep on the right path and find useful solutions for the industry.

Tobe In this post, we take the wind out from under Shake Shack's hero wings, see why your business needs to keep oil prices in mind, and learn what job sectors will be hiring after the pandemic is over. Also in this week's highlights, Workstream's very own Head of Customer Success, Aaron F. Delgadillo, will be sharing all his tips from working with HR leaders from some of the biggest brands out there (McDonald's, Marriott, Jamba Juice, and more). Sign up here! Why Shake Shack isn't really heroic for returning its PPP loan Shake Shack, the purveyors of ok-ish burgers (I'm an In-N-Out type), made headlines this week for generously giving back the $10 million government loan they received from the Payment Protection Program. While on the surface, it seemed a commendable move by the chain, the picture gets murkier when you consider why a publicly-traded company with annual revenues of nearly $460 million (in 2018) even applied for the PPP in the first place. Keep in mind, Shake Shack has over 6,000 employees (2018) and while $10 million is a lot for your mom & pop shop, that's barely $1600 per worker... over the course of the 2.5 months that the PPP is supposed to cover. Here's the kicker: that's far, far less than what these employees would get from unemployment. And considering that the PPP is a loan with a questionable and confusing forgiveness policy , one that has to be repaid in just 2 years time, it doesn't take a CPA to determine that this tiny loan would be nothing more than a headache for the burger chain and their employees. Furloughing and allowing them to collect unemployment is a smarter move. The Takeaway: The PPP can be a lifeline for small businesses, but it's important to know when to take the loan and when not to, especially when taking the loan will hurt your employees more in the long run. Read up on the pitfalls of the PPP. Remember, just because you applied, it doesn't mean you have to accept. Oil in free-fall. Literally. For a moment there, oil was literally free . Negative, in fact, and worth less than the steel drums it's kept in. You might be wondering, \"What does that mean for my business besides a cheaper commute?\" Well, oil is not only a large part of the US economy but perhaps a solid leading indicator of where the economy is headed. As much as the sea turtles hate it, America and the world's industry runs on oil. Low oil prices signify too much supply and not enough demand, which means the world economy isn't close to ramping up manufacturing, travel, or trade. There has been plenty of historical evidence of oil as a leading indicator , and just last year the market has been tied to oil . So once it starts to rise due to demand, that will be a stronger indicator that the economy might be on the upswing. At the very least, a better indicator than the craziness that is Wall Street over the past few weeks. The Takeaway: Despite what Tesla wants you to think, keep watch on the price of oil. It may be a good indicator of when your small business might want to come out of hibernation. Chart Analysis: Who's hiring during, and after, coronavirus Check out this chart from the World Economic Forum using data from the US Department of Labor: It's a good snapshot of the occupations that are the most at-risk of coming into contact with COVID-19. Unsurprisingly, health professionals are at the right of the chart, while those who can work from home like Marketing Managers hug the left side. In general, the jobs on the left above $50k annual salary seem fairly \"safe\" in today's environment: they can be done remotely and employment should be relatively stable. These jobs might be hiring during this time. But the jobs to the left that are below $50k are the one hurting the most: retail, transit drivers, cleaners. These are the jobs that have experienced huge lay-offs and furloughs. It's reasonable that as the pandemic breaks, there will be a rolling wave of hirings from right to left, top to bottom. As the essential workers (on the right) shore up their numbers, the tide of job opportunities should ripple left and down. As more people get back to work, the more they'll need the services of retail, transit drivers, etc. Understanding this job recovery can help your business determine when to start hiring, and also when people will be looking.

Read more to learn about his insights, hiring trends and statistics, and an up-close perspective on how things have changed in the recruitment landscape. Kristen Sze (K): Welcome back. Now let’s get to our next expert of the day. He’s the founder of Workstream - they work with hundreds of businesses and help them with automating the hiring and onboarding process. So joining us is founder Desmond Lim. How are you, Desmond? Desmond (D): I’m well, and you? How are you doing? K: I’m doing well too, thank you. I mean we have jobs and we’re thankful for that. Because all we’re hearing right now is people losing their jobs, especially the hourly workers. So you have the big picture right, so tell us, how does the job board look right now? Is it way down? And which industries are way down more than other industries? D: Yeah, that is great for you to ask. So we surely see a mix - so there’s surely many companies that are not hiring. As you all know, restaurants, hotels, cafes, they’re all closed. So for those job postings, they’re way down. But there are still some that are trying to hire. And for those that are still trying to hire, they are trying to hire more. So some of them are like senior living homes, supermarkets, companies that are trying to hire drivers. So in those sectors, we see a trend that is actually going upwards. For example I would say that in terms of job postings for drivers, we see a trend of almost 3x growth. And in terms of job postings for nurses, we see a trend of almost 2x. K: And are those wages actually going up in those industries which you say are really ramping up right now? D: Yeah, in terms of wages, it has actually stayed flat based on what we see. But I think that there's much more job openings for some of those roles. I think overall, pay has stayed flat. In certain roles like nurses, where there’s this high risk being on the frontline - for those we’ve seen the wage go up slightly. K: Okay, so, if certain industries are contracting and others are expanding, so to speak. If you’re a job seeker and you think, God I need to make money right now, are there certain regions in the state that you will send people to, where those regions are actually doing more hiring? D: Yeah, I would say so. I think mostly in these coastal regions, those have actually been generally down, just think about New York and the Bay Area. But I would say in this Mid-West, those are still actually holding strong. Actually I would say that in terms of trends we see in this Mid-West and in the South, maybe about only half of this restaurants and hotels are closed. Maybe about half are you know, still open. So we surely see like, if you’re in those areas, you should surely be trying for jobs. I would say that being said, we do see a trend whereby for those jobs that are still open, we see more people trying for those jobs. For example, we have a client, a gas station chain, they have about 50 roles open. Past 3 days, we have seen about 7000 people try for those roles. That is almost like a 5x jump. K: So let me ask you, eventually we will come out of this and in the post COVID-19 world, do you see any changes in the way people look for jobs or interview applicants? D: Yeah, I do see a few trends on that front. So we have had several clients come to us say we want to talk about this contactless screening, trying to meet with people via this video, via texting. So that is part of our core software that we have been able to do it. We help our clients to be able to screen people, and source them, and to actually talk to them via zoom video, or texting on the phone. So we surely see a trend move towards that. People want to first meet you when you’re home and they want to be able to see your face and talk to you, prior to bringing you to where they’re at, so yes. K: Got it, so based on all these changes that are already starting to happen and accelerate even in the post COVID-19 world, and based on what you see in terms of what the jobs will be, what can a job seeker do right now to kind of put themselves in the best position to get one of those jobs once companies really start to hire again? D: Yeah, that’s a great question. I think in terms of how they should prep, I think this is a great time to actually go back to school. We have all these classes that are all now online, so that is surely something that we’ve been trying to tell our currently hourly folks to - hey, take this break, take this time, if you really can’t find work, stay home, try to take some online courses that can be really helpful. So I think that is some trend that we see. Second trend that we see is trying to tell people - hey, try to be open for job changes. We see a trend whereby more people are going to work from home. So restaurants, cafes, hotels, they are going to pivot to actually cater towards that need. So we are trying to tell people, hey be open to job changes, be open to job trainings, those will be very helpful for you. K: Alright, Desmond Lim, we are out of time. Although I’m going to spend 5 seconds and just ask you how long do you think before the economy is back? D: I think it’ll be back in about 3-6 months from what I see. I hope it’ll be sooner but yup. K: Alright, let’s check back with you then. Desmond Lim, founder of Workstream, thank you so much for your time and insights today. Really appreciate it. D: Thank you so much for your time! K: Oh hey, Desmond we have time for one more question, do you have any data on employees calling in sick? Are we seeing that in huge numbers? D: Yes, we do have that. K: Alright, tell us about that. D: We definitely see about 35% of folks who are trying to call in sick. So we think that that is like a very, very big jump. There’s a few factors that are trying to drive that. Some of them are sick because they’re tired, but many of them are trying to call sick because they have to stay home and actually take care of their kids because kids are now out of school, so they are not able to leave the kids. We see a trend too whereby many folks, their parents, they are sick too. Many of these hourly folks, they don’t have a choice but to call in sick, so that they can stay back home. That is a very clear trend that we see. K: So then, are any employers offering additional help to people who are in those situations so that they don’t need to resort to calling in sick? D: Yeah, I think some of them are. We see a trend of about 20% of these hourly folks, they are trying to ask for more loans so that is now what they’re doing, trying to ask for more loans. And many of these businesses and companies are trying to be helpful by given the loans that they can. Because many of these folks, they can’t even pay rental. K: Alright. Tough times for a lot of folks but you also offer some hope as far as how people can position themselves for the future. So Desmond Lim, thank you so much. Really great to see you and now we’re going to leave you for real. Take care! D: Thank you so much! Take care!

Truman In this post, we take stock of the unemployment realities many businesses are facing, which sectors are hot right now, and learn what not to do from the mistakes of local governments’ web portals during this crisis. Virtual, reality: Businesses shifting online to survive Small businesses were feeling the burn of the current economic conditions the last month, and now it’s trickled up to much larger entities. Harvard University announced salary and hiring freezes among other cost-cutting measures. Disney World is furloughing a staggering 43,000 workers. The coronavirus pandemic is affecting every business from the Fortune 500 list to your local shops. But while enterprise-level corporations are seeing massive layoffs, there is a potential bright spot for smaller companies that are able to pivot quickly to offer their services online. You already know about online schools and concerts. But then there’s a slew of virtual cooking classes, mixology courses, and wine tasting classes being led by intrepid people embracing tech. Real estate agents are giving virtual property tours to sell when people can’t actually visit the houses. Even car dealerships are moving hard to online sales . The Takeaway: If you can pivot to running even a part of your business online, now’s the time to do so. With a vaccine at least a year away and many health experts predicting rolling quarantine weeks in the future, the businesses that can move online first will win. Which means... Big tech companies are hiring like it’s 1999 More like 2009, but Prince was clearly ahead of his time. That year, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, tech giants like Google and Apple were “ scooping up talent that had been laid off elsewhere. ” These companies have the reserves to weather downturns, and they can hire relatively cheap engineers and programmers during these types of situations. And with technology being even more important for businesses today, they aren’t wrong to invest in growth. But streaming and computer pixels can only get companies so far. Businesses still need boots on the ground to run warehouses and manage goods. Amazon is also on a hiring spree, seeking to fill another 75,000 jobs as delivery becomes the new normal. In fact, unskilled workers may oddly have a leg up during a time when people are afraid to leave their houses. The gig economy of drivers, delivery people, and other hourly workers will constantly be in demand for more hires for the foreseeable future. The Takeaway: Tech companies are competing for both highly-skilled and unskilled workers. If you’re hiring either, you can’t rest on your laurels during this time. Teachable moment: Awful government web portals From Nevada to California to Pennsylvania, you name it: web portals for unemployment benefits are crashing left and right leading to anger and frustration from the millions of people trying to file. Clearly they weren’t designed to handle this many applicants, but no one applying is giving them that leniency. At the end of the day, a bad website is a bad website and users will be turned off. These web portal crashes highlight the need for better, more streamlined tech in place to process applicants without straining servers and corrupting data. It made us reevaluate our own internal hiring portal and now might be a good time for your business to do so as well. Need help hiring the right people? Workstream can help.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Company news 08/30/19 What I learned from applying to 300 jobs Share this article People told me I would easily get a job out of college. 3.6 GPA. Strong internship experiences. I was an entrepreneur. I had started a restaurant before. I represented my country in international basketball tournaments and served in the military as an infantry officer. I was energetic, passionate, and ready to get my first professional experience out of college. Despite all that, I still had my fair share of rejected job applications before landing my first job. When I began job hunting, I prepared myself. I didn' t want to take things for granted. I applied for a wide range of jobs, from hourly positions to full-time professional opportunities, from working in operations to doing finance. I worked on a comprehensive Excel sheet to document every single job I applied for, tracking the status of my job application to the date I applied online, and whether my job application was rejected or accepted. I put in tens of hours every week while I was finishing up my last couple of months at college and was determined to get a job quickly after school. Starting from a couple of job applications at the start of the year, it quickly piled up to 10s and then to 100s of job applications from Jamba Juice to Walmart to the local restaurant franchise and Disney. However, after I had submitted my first few applications, I didn' t hear back for weeks. I knew it was 2009, and there was a financial crisis, but I couldn't help but feel disappointed. I felt sick and worried. I had prepared my best application, checked my resume countless times, and started to interview prep with my friends. I would go on to not even receive an email confirmation for over two months. And then, I began receiving rejected job applications. But I didn't give up. After three months of applying, I finally got called for my first interview—it was with a global retail company. I was excited! I prepared myself to the best of my abilities by practicing with friends and conducting research online. I showed up 15 minutes early in my best suit and tie. However, the interview didn't go smoothly. And I attribute that to the limited communication from the point of submitting the application to scheduling the interview. I didn't have opportunities to ask questions about the role or the interview process, and I was ultimately unprepared for the interview. This would go on to happen several times. And it made me realize that modern hiring and recruitment systems needed some change. There needed to be a better way to engage applicants or to connect with them. (This experience was one of the motivating factors for me to start Workstream 10 years later!) However, I didn't give up. I continued to do what I knew best—to follow up with companies, network, and demonstrate my skills. I called companies and enquired about opportunities. I reached out to seniors and alumni from schools that I hoped could open doors. I also continued to keep track of various opportunities I applied for, and six months later, I realized I had applied to over 300 jobs. It was a humbling experience, but after more than six months of applying to jobs, I finally received my first job offer! I was over the moon. In reflecting on the path from 300 applications, several rejected job applications, and my first job offer, I've identified a few insights for fellow job seekers. Follow up after your interview It's essential to follow up after each job interview with a thank you email to the interviewer(s). Be sure to share some specific anecdotes from the interview so your email doesn't seem generic. This is helpful to build rapport and leave a strong impression with the hiring committee. It's even better if you're able to share stories or experiences that the interviewer shared with you. Connect with alumni, friends, and people in your network People want to be helpful! Reach out to people in your network with a clear ask, whether that be guidance or a short informational interview. If not, ask specific questions about a role or a career path via email. Look to alumni at your school or people whom you share experiences or interests with like a non-profit or professional club. Do research on the company beforehand It always helps to know about a company's brand, culture, and history. Read about them online or speak to people who have worked there before. It's helpful to know the background of a company, and whether you're aligned to their mission, vision, and culture. Share your story Stories are a great way to engage with people and help them learn more about you. I love the STAR technique of Scenario, Task, Action, Result. In the STAR technique, you clearly set out the backdrop of the story and then share with the other party the clear task and action to achieve a desired outcome. Dress well and smile more People are always more open to connecting with people who are warm and friendly. It also helps to dress in a neat and tidy way, as first impressions are very important. Surveys have shared that people make a first impression within the first couple of seconds. Finally, I learned that applying for jobs takes persistence and hard work. It also takes a lot of following up with people and putting your best foot forward. Best of luck!

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Company news 08/30/19 Vincent Tee | Senior Engineer at Workstream Share this article Vincent Tee is a Senior Engineer at Workstream. He is tasked with working wonders on the frontend and backend of Workstream's codebase, making sure that the product satisfy all of clients' needs. He has worked in 4 different countries, speaks 5 languages excluding C++, Java, PHP, Javascript, Ruby to name a few. He loves creating and being a part of products which help eliminate pain points and put smiles on people's faces. When he is not busy doing that, you can often find him eliminating monsters in virtual worlds or working on his bicycle kicks or dunks. Q: What made you choose Workstream in front of other companies? Vincent: I joined Workstream in Q1 2018. It's been one full year! Prior to Workstream, I was already working with our CEO Desmond for 6 months on a previous software development venture. Although I have known him for over 20 years (damn, our age is showing), it was the 1st time we worked together professionally and I must say it was a very positive experience. Thus it was a natural and easy decision for me to follow him into Workstream when he decided that this was to be his new baby. Q: What professional accomplishments are you most proud of since you joined Workstream? Vincent: A large part of my time has been devoted to engineering the scheduling module within Workstream. A lot of effort was spent from the beginning, gathering user feedback, doing research on the implementation, deciding to code it from scratch and finally releasing it to our clients. Then getting more feedback from clients (infinite loop!) and improving the module. It is pleasing to know that scheduling is now an integral part of many clients' workflow, enabling them to easily arrange interviews with prospective applicants. Their enthusiasm to share feedback with us means that this module will constantly be improved to better serve our clients' needs. Happy clients give me, as well as the rest of our product team, more motivation to work even harder. Q: How this role is challenging you? Vincent: This is in fact the first time I am building a web application! Prior to Workstream, I had worked mainly on native mobile apps, PC, mobile and web games. There are new technologies which I had to pick up, which is challenging yet fun. Often times I had to spend more time doing research and learning certain concepts even from the basics, and that meant I needed to put in more time and effort to master the technology stack that we are using to build Workstream. However, learning is a challenge that I embrace, and to be able to do that while building an amazing software, with an equally amazing team, is something which I truly enjoy. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Vincent: Yes, definitely. I've had quite a few hourly jobs before. First was when I was about 18, I worked as a packer for a convenience store on an ad-hoc basis. Usually I will start work after the shop closes, which will be like 9pm at night, and work all the way past midnight. It was tough work, but through that I earned my 1st salary and started my journey to become financially independent. When I was in university, I took up a part time job too at a telecommunications company, working as a Customer Service consultant. For five days a week, I answered calls in the evening, dealing with common questions, as well as (many) complains from customers. It was a really interesting experience for me as it was my 1st long term job apart from military service, working there for almost two years, and I got the chance to interact with people from all walks of life. These experiences not only opened my eyes and allowed me to realize how hourly workers have to strive hard to make a living, but also allowed me to better understand how people think and work. This turns out to be a useful skill to have when building software for people! Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Vincent: The biggest challenge I've had was undoubtedly when I started embarking on my startup journey. When I decided to bootstrap my startup, taking no pay and working full time on my own mobile app, I took a big risk financially, and was optimistic that this is something that could work out. In hindsight, I was naive and underestimated how difficult it was to create a successful business. With limited experience in the startup industry, and definitely no experience heading a company, I made many mistakes along the way, and not always hiring the right people too. This made me realize how important it is to hire the right person for each role, especially for a startup or a small business. Q: What is something you learned that you practice daily? Vincent: Time management is something which I had struggled with when I started working on my own business. Sometimes, it seems like there are just too much work to do, and I'm not sure how to manage all of them. A to do list doesn't solve the problem. Other times, there's lack of motivation or I got burnt out from overworking. Later on, I started reading up more about different techniques for more efficient work, and started to better compartmentalize my time. Instead of a to do list, which can become overwhelming, I started to put everything into my calendar. And I really do mean everything, even time allocated for rest, family and chores. I make it a point to also have some empty spaces in my calendar every week for me to do whatever I want. As for work, 10 minutes a day planning which tasks to fill up my work hours with helps greatly with the productivity as well. I guess in conclusion the thing I learnt is how to be more organized and productive, so that you have more time for everything - work and play too! Q: Who inspires you and why? Vincent: I draw inspiration from many sources! There was a time where I was pretty much hooked on motivational videos, listening to how successful and also unsuccessful people had to share about their experiences and trying to learn from them. If I had to pick one person, I'll say Jack Ma. His rags to riches story is now well known to most people, and it is really such an amazing fairy tale in the business world. The way he started at the very bottom, and managed to claw his way up to the top despite limited resources at hand, highlights the point that most people, if having the right motivation and desire, will have the ability to learn, and to succeed at a high level. Q: I know you are one of the Play-Pal co-founders. What is one piece of advice that you will give someone which is running a start-up? Vincent: When I started PlayPal with my co-founders, it was really a giant leap of faith, albeit into the unknown. There was no doubt we had the passion in what we wanted to do, which was to help football lovers more easily find others to enjoy playing the game with. It had good intentions, and we were sure that it will help thousands of people out there, which it did. However, it never managed to grow to a point where we could scale it up to become a viable business. So the one piece of advice I will give, will be to do more research. If you are still planning to start a company, do more research on the target market, and make sure that there is a viable business model. If you are already running a startup, then make sure that you continue to do your research and to ensure that the business stays relevant in the face of competitors and also other challenges. Only armed with knowledge, can the captain truly steer the ship in the right direction and towards the final destination, wherever that is - land, or even treasures!

Share this article The beauty of new hire surveys lies not just in their ability to provide crucial insights for HR leaders but also as tools for employees to voice their initial impressions and experiences. Like whispers caught on the wind, they offer valuable feedback that can help shape an organization's culture and improve its onboarding practices. As we unravel this narrative together, you'll learn how crafting impactful survey questions is akin to designing keys that unlock doors of understanding. Understanding the Role and Importance of New Hire Surveys New hire surveys play a pivotal role in gauging an employee's initial impressions about an organization. These surveys are not just questionnaires , but vital tools that give HR leaders insights into the effectiveness of their onboarding program . The Function of New Hire Surveys A new hire survey is more than just asking questions to fill out forms; it’s about understanding how your team members feel when they start working at your company. It gives employees a voice, making them feel valued from day one. Gathering this feedback helps HR managers identify what’s working well in the recruitment process and where improvements can be made. So if only 12% of employees believe their organization does a good job during onboarding, as Gallup research shows , then there's definitely room for improvement. The Impact of New Hire Surveys on Onboarding Onboarding surveys provide valuable data that help organizations make sure every new recruit feels welcomed, engaged, and ready to contribute to their current role. The impact these surveys have isn’t limited to making tweaks here or there—it often leads to complete revamps that enhance the entire employee lifecycle experience. This early feedback allows companies not only to improve processes but also to shape the culture by identifying trends among incoming staff – giving you real-time insight into shaping your future workforce. It's a great situation for all parties. Designing Effective New Hire Survey Questions To start, creating a new hire survey isn't about just throwing together some questions. It requires strategic thinking and understanding what you want to achieve. The objective is to obtain useful comments that can aid in refining the induction procedure, worker experience, and eventually your organization's culture. Crafting Open-Ended Questions Open-ended questions are crucial in any survey as they give hires an opportunity to express their thoughts freely. Unlike close-ended ones, these allow for more nuanced responses beyond simple 'yes' or 'no' answers. An illustration of an open-ended query could be, \"In what manner did our onboarding program measure up to your anticipations?\" as opposed to a closed one such as, \"Did our onboarding system satisfy your expectations?\". This invites detailed responses which offer deeper insights into the employees' experiences . An interesting stat from SHRM, indicates satisfaction levels tend to be measured using a scale of 1-5 in surveys. So consider incorporating such scales in tandem with open-ended queries for comprehensive data collection. Mixing different types of questions - quantitative ( rating scales ) and qualitative (open text fields) – will give you both clear metrics and rich context behind them. The key here is balance. Including Key Topics Your questionnaire should cover all aspects of the recruitment process including first impressions when they began working at the company, how well team members made them feel welcomed during formal onboarding sessions or if there were any obstacles encountered while starting out at their current role. Keep it focused but also broad enough so nothing gets overlooked. And remember - always leave room for additional comments or suggestions at the end. Designing effective survey questions may seem daunting at first, but with careful planning and consideration of your new hires ' journey from start to finish, you'll be able to create a tool that provides meaningful insights for continuous improvement. Key Takeaway: Designing new hire surveys needs strategy, not just random questions. Use open-ended queries for nuanced responses and mix them with quantitative ones like rating scales for a balanced view. Cover all recruitment aspects and always make space for extra comments or suggestions. It's about capturing meaningful insights to enhance onboarding. Interpreting Rating Scale Responses A common element in many surveys, including those focused on employee engagement , is a rating scale . This method lets us quantify an employee’s experience , giving it a numeric value. The interpretation may seem straightforward - higher numbers mean better experiences, right? But remember: context matters. An average score of 4 out of 5 might seem great until you realize most organizations are averaging at least 4.5. We also need to pay attention not just to averages but spread or variation too. A wide range indicates differing opinions among team members which could suggest inconsistencies in their experience. To really make sense of these scores though, we must look beyond the numbers themselves and consider other factors such as individual comments or open-ended question responses. This will give us a more holistic view and enable effective action plans for improvement based on our findings from these new hire surveys . Last but not least, remember this isn't a one-time thing – regular analysis ensures continued learning and ongoing improvements in your organization's culture. With all this considered, we're ready to act. Using this valuable feedback from employees' experiences with the hiring process allows HR leaders to fix potential issues and ensure a smooth onboarding experience for all future hires. This can result in increased employee productivity, engagement, and ultimately the success of your organization. The Impact of New Hire Surveys on Employee Performance and Retention Consider this: your organization has just welcomed a fresh batch of talent. You've given them the grand tour, introduced them to their team members , and got them started with their tasks. How can you be certain that the new recruits are content with their role or if there is any scope for improvement? This is where new hire surveys come into play. By gathering feedback from employees about their initial impressions when they began working, organizations can identify potential issues early on—issues that might affect an employee's experience down the line. A Powerful Tool for Improving Job Performance An effective survey helps create an environment conducive to better job performance by allowing HR leaders to pinpoint what works—and what doesn't—in current roles within the company's culture . Gartner research indicates that well-executed onboarding—which includes strategic use of these surveys—can improve employee performance by up to 15%. Influence On Retention Rates Surveys aren't only beneficial during those first few weeks after someone starts working—they have long-term effects as well. The same Gartner study shows an increase in retention rates resulting from effective new hire surveys . Yes, taking time out at the start does pay off later. Best Practices for Conducting New Hire Surveys Gathering valuable feedback from new hires is a vital part of improving the onboarding experience . Here are some proven practices to make your hire surveys more effective. Ensuring Employee Engagement in Surveys To get honest responses, you need to ensure that employees feel engaged and comfortable participating in these surveys. Start by explaining why their input matters. Tell them how their insights will help improve employee experience across the organization's culture, making it a great place for everyone. Provide a safe space where staff can freely communicate their ideas without apprehension of being rebuked or penalized. You can even incorporate anonymous survey questions into your recruitment process as one way to do this. In addition, don't limit yourself only asking about formal onboarding programs or current role-related topics but also ask about HR leaders' approachability and whether they felt welcomed when they began working here. It's all part of creating a good onboarding experience . Gallup research shows that only 12% of employees believe organizations handle onboarding well; hence getting this right is essential. Last but not least, keep iterating based upon feedback received. If multiple team members highlight issues with specific parts of the employee lifecycle (like confusion around understanding the employee handbook), consider making improvements there first. This Harvard Business Review article offers more tips about building successful teams and managing remote employees effectively. So go ahead, let’s give our new hires an opportunity to voice out what works best for them during their initial days at work. After all, a great start can set the tone for an employee's experience throughout their tenure with your company. The Role of New Hire Surveys in Enhancing Onboarding Procedures As an HR leader, you know that the onboarding process sets the tone for a new hire 's tenure at your company. But how can we make sure this crucial period is as effective and engaging as possible? The answer lies with new hire surveys . New hire surveys give us valuable feedback about our onboarding program . They let us peek into the initial impressions of our team members when they start working, giving insights into what's working and where improvements are needed. A good onboarding survey includes questions that help gauge an employee's experience during their first few weeks or months. Gallup research reveals that only 12% of employees believe their organization does a good job during onboarding - indicating there’s much room for improvement. Making Improvements Based On Feedback Employee feedback gathered from these surveys can pinpoint areas needing more attention within your current role as an HR manager. For example, do remote employees feel welcomed? Is there enough clarity provided about roles and responsibilities? If not, it might be time to revisit your employee handbook or revamp some aspects of your formal onboarding practices to better suit all team members ’ needs. Fostering Employee Engagement Early On A well-executed onboard process, backed by insightful data from engagement surveys, helps foster positive employee experiences right off the bat. This early investment contributes significantly towards making your workplace a great place to work—boosting retention rates and ensuring each recruit gets off to a great start. Remember, The Journey Just Begins With Onboarding The employee lifecycle doesn't end with onboarding. It's just the commencement of something amazing. Regular feedback surveys can provide ongoing insights throughout an employee's tenure, helping your organization build and maintain a positive company culture that lasts. Key Takeaway: Use New Hire Surveys to Boost Onboarding: Get real-time feedback from your new team members . This can help you see what's working and where improvements are needed in the onboarding process . It's a great way to make sure everyone feels welcome, understands their role, and starts off strong. FAQs in Relation to New Hire Surveys What questions are asked in the onboarding survey? The onboarding survey often includes queries about job expectations, training quality, workplace culture, and initial experiences with team members . What questions are on the 6 month new employee survey? A six-month new hire survey typically asks for feedback about job satisfaction, learning curve progress, support from supervisors, and ideas for process improvement. What are the most common employee surveys? The usual types of worker surveys include engagement check-ins , performance reviews , exit interviews, and health/wellness evaluations. Why survey new hires ? We poll fresh employees to gather insight into their onboarding experience . This helps refine procedures so they feel welcome and set up for success faster.

A beacon guiding us through the foggy seas of uncertainty. But here's where it gets tricky - creating pulse surveys is an art as much as it is science. It demands precision, creativity and understanding – crafting questions that are concise yet insightful; picking software that’s intuitive but robust. I bet you're wondering, \"How can I master this art?\" Stick around for a journey into uncharted territories of effective survey design and strategy implementation! Defining Pulse Surveys An explanation of what pulse surveys are and how they differ from traditional surveys. Pulse surveys , as their name suggests, are quick check-ins with your team. These short employee pulse surveys often consist of just 3-6 questions that allow for immediate action or further investigation into any issues identified. A common misconception is to equate these brief check-ins with traditional employee engagement surveys . But there's a key difference: while an annual survey provides a broad overview, a pulse survey offers real-time insights. It’s like comparing an annual physical exam to regularly checking your heart rate during exercise. This approach helps measure trends and track progress more accurately by gathering agreement levels frequently rather than once annually. The result? A dynamic snapshot of the workplace culture at regular intervals instead of relying on static data from previous participation in yearly reviews. The Role of Pulse Surveys in Employee Engagement Discussing how pulse surveys contribute to enhancing employee engagement and experience. Pulse surveys play a vital role in enhancing employee experience by providing invaluable feedback promptly - not months later when it might be less relevant or even forgotten entirely. Moreover, they also boost response rates due to their brevity and ease compared to lengthy annual engagement surveys – who doesn’t appreciate being able to voice their opinion without filling out pages upon pages? Beyond gauging how employees feel about various aspects at work, such as management style or workplace conditions; they're effective tools for action planning based on real-time feedback which ultimately leads towards higher overall engagement levels . Key Takeaway: Pulse surveys are quick, frequent check-ins with your team that offer real-time insights into workplace culture and employee engagement . They differ from traditional annual surveys by giving a dynamic snapshot of the work environment regularly, instead of once-a-year static data. These brief surveys help boost response rates due to their ease and brevity while enabling action planning based on timely feedback. How to Design Effective Pulse Surveys Pulse surveys are a powerful tool for gauging employee sentiment and engagement levels . But creating an effective pulse survey needs thoughtful planning. Crafting High-Quality Survey Questions To begin, it is critical to create queries that are succinct and direct in order to get the information needed. A well-crafted question not only increases response rates but also gives you valuable insights into your employees' experience . For example, using Likert scale questions can help gather agreement levels on various aspects of workplace culture. Also remember that pulse survey questions should be action-oriented - designed in a way that they reveal actionable data about areas like customer service or employee satisfaction . Selecting a Suitable Survey Tool Choosing the right platform for conducting your pulse surveys is equally crucial as designing the survey itself. You need software capable of handling repeated measures so you can track progress over time and compare with previous participation data. A comparison between popular tools such as Google Forms vs. SurveyMonkey shows distinct features each brings along, affecting how effectively you create pulse surveys based on your unique needs. SurveyMonkey , for instance, offers more customization options while Google Forms provides simplicity in its interface which might work better if speed is what you're after when creating these regular check-ins with staff members. Remember this golden rule: Consistent surveying helps measure the impact of events on baseline numbers—an invaluable benefit no matter which tool gets used. Implementing Pulse Surveys in Your Organization To start, we need to set the right frequency for these quick check-ins . That's where survey cadence comes into play. It’s like setting a beat that your employees can follow without feeling overwhelmed or experiencing survey fatigue . The key is balance – frequent enough to catch changes as they happen but spaced out enough so it doesn't feel like a chore. Determining the Ideal Frequency for Pulse Surveys The frequency of pulse surveys should be tailored to the team's size, culture, and objectives. But remember, these aren’t meant to replace annual engagement surveys entirely. A good starting point could be monthly or quarterly pulse checks complemented by an annual deep dive. This approach allows you to stay informed about employee sentiment while also leaving room for comprehensive analysis once a year. Maximizing Response Rates The success of any survey lies in its response rate - higher participation means more data and better insights. So how do we get there? By making sure every employee knows their voice matters. You can increase engagement levels by communicating clearly about why you're conducting these pulse surveys and how their feedback will lead to positive change within the organization. Create simple yet impactful questions focused on specific topics related to workplace culture or customer service experience. Anonymity might help too. Employees may give honest feedback if they know it won't affect them personally. Incentives never hurt either - consider offering small rewards for completion rates. Employee Satisfaction Surveys have shown that implementing pulse surveys can significantly improve your organization's understanding of customer goals and enhance their experience. But remember, the real power lies in acting on this feedback. So Key Takeaway: Starting pulse surveys in your organization? Get the frequency right to avoid overwhelming employees. Mix monthly or quarterly quick checks with annual deep dives for balance. Boost response rates by assuring employee voices matter, crafting targeted questions, offering anonymity and incentives. Act on feedback to truly enhance customer experience. Analyzing Pulse Survey Results and Taking Action Interpreting pulse survey data is much like sifting for gold. It's about finding those nuggets of insight that can drive meaningful change in your organization. Interpreting Pulse Survey Data Digging into the results, you might notice patterns or trends that signal shifts in employee sentiment . Remember, these surveys are a powerful tool to understand frequent changes in opinions and preferences of customers, employees, and target markets. You're not just counting votes; you're looking at overall engagement levels too. Lower response rates may suggest survey fatigue or disengagement among staff. Consider using tools like an AB Test Significance Calculator. They help interpret raw data more effectively by measuring things such as agreement levels to certain questions or issues raised by respondents repeatedly. Creating and Implementing Action Plans The real magic happens when you turn insights from your pulse surveys into action plans . These should address issues identified during the analysis phase with clear steps on how to fix them—be it boosting morale, improving workplace culture, or addressing customer service shortcomings. A well-constructed plan needs regular tracking to measure its impact over time—and yes—you guessed it: More pulse surveys . Repeated measures allow us not only to track progress but also to gauge whether our actions have been effective. Create smaller teams responsible for specific tasks tied directly back to the feedback received; Prioritize tasks based on their potential impact on engagement; Routinely check-in with employees through follow-up pulse surveys ensuring we are hitting the mark. Not just inquiring, but tuning in to responses and taking action - that's how you get a grasp on your organization. It’s about listening to answers and acting upon them—because that's how you get a pulse on your organization. The Impact of Pulse Surveys on Company Culture and Customer Service Pulse surveys have a remarkable influence in shaping company culture and enhancing customer service. They let us measure shifts in brand awareness, perceptions over time, and even the ways employees feel about their work environment . Integrating Pulse Surveys into Company Culture By making pulse surveys a routine part of your operations, you create an open channel for employee feedback . This fosters a culture that values continuous improvement - because every opinion matters. Leveraging Pulse Surveys to Enhance Customer Service A pulse survey isn't just an internal tool; it’s also your secret weapon for improving customer service. By tracking progress through repeated measures, you get real-time insights into what customers love about your services - and areas where they'd appreciate some tweaks. Your frontline teams are the first ones to hear compliments (and complaints). A quick weekly employee pulse survey lets them share these experiences with decision-makers who can act swiftly on this valuable information. Now imagine comparing data from previous participation rates against current response rates : any significant change tells you if changes made based on earlier feedback are working well or not. Remember how everyone loved 'Honey I Shrunk The Kids'? It's kind of like shrinking down those big annual engagement surveys so they're easier for people to complete regularly without experiencing dreaded ' survey fatigue '. The result? More action-oriented questions, higher response rates , and better insights. So get ready to revamp your survey strategy with pulse surveys – it's like a defibrillator for your company culture and customer service. Key Takeaway: Consider pulse surveys as your company's heartbeat monitor, tuning into both culture and customer service. By consistently using them, you let everyone be heard and foster a climate that cherishes constant growth. Plus, they're like your undercover ace for boosting customer service - offering immediate insights on what customers dig or want to see better in your offerings. It all boils down to sparking big changes. Incorporating Effective Pulse Survey Questions The quality of your questions matters too. Remember, we’re aiming for action-oriented questions here – ones that provide invaluable insights into workplace culture and help address issues effectively. To improve customer service or measure trends in employee satisfaction , ask specific questions like 'How satisfied are you with our recent policy changes?' rather than generic queries such as 'Are you happy at work?' Focusing on Action Planning Post-Survey An effective pulse survey is not only about gathering agreement levels but also sparking change within the organization based on those findings. This involves diligent analysis post-survey - interpreting data correctly is vital. Remember: while selecting methods may seem challenging initially, understanding how each contributes towards enhancing engagement levels can guide you in the right direction. Don't be intimidated to explore and discover the most successful strategy for your team. FAQs in Relation to Pulse Surveys Why do we do pulse surveys ?

Depending on your business, this could be as simple as controlling the music, picking the special of the day, decorating your location for the holiday, or posting to the company social media account. 5. Appreciation isn't only top-down Inspire your team to show appreciation for one another too! Encourage your team to bring valentines to work for their coworkers, or put up a poster board in the backroom where employees can write what they appreciate about other team members. Helping your team bond increases loyalty and ultimately decreases turnover—a win-win! Spread the love this Valentine's Day Showing some appreciation to your employees goes a long way and can be done in the simplest of ways.

    "status": "success",
    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 06/17/22 8 mistakes you're making on your QSR job listing Share this article There are more quick-service restaurant (QSR) positions open today than people applying for jobs. That means your job listing has to work extra hard to attract applicants to your business instead of to your compeititors'. In helping thousands of managers recruit hourly workers over the years, we've identified a few of the most common mistakes people make when writing job descriptions that keep them from sourcing enough applicants. Pull up your open listings and gut-check them against these no-nos. A few quick edits will make a big difference in your applicant pool. 1. Using \"clever\" job titles Don't waste your time trying to come up with unique job titles. Applicants aren't searching for \"Kitchen Wizard\" jobs. They're searching for \"line cooks,\" \"Dishwashers,\" or \"Cashiers.\" Instead of being clever, be specific . List your location or a must-have skill with your job title to ensure you're getting the right candidates applying—and your listing comes up in their online search to begin with. 2. Being too generic Yes, you can find job description templates for virtually any job on the internet. And while these are a great way to whip up a job listing quickly, take the extra step to personalize yours. What makes working at your restaurant unique or special? Can you throw in a quote from a current employee about their experience on the job? Can you include real photos from your restaurant featuring real employees? Do you offer any perks beyond what's standard or expected? 3. Being too static In the age of Instagram and TikTok, attention spans are short. Your prospective employees are attracted to imagery, video—anything eye catching. Capture more eyeballs by going beyond a plain text job listing and including photos from your restaurant like we mentioned above, or even a quick welcome video from the hiring manager or current employee. 4. Hiding important information According to research conducted by the Nielson Norman Group, 79% of internet users scan before they read word-by-word . Applicants are not reading every word of your job description, but they are making several assumptions from their first impression. So don't bury information in giant blocks of text . Instead, make it easy for people to get enticed at just a glance. Use bulleted lists Bold or italicize critical information Include white space throughout the description Break up big paragraphs Don’t use industry jargon potential employees might not know Run your listing through a spelling/grammar checker before posting it 5. Hiding employee benefits Employee benefit packages for hourly workers have come a long way in recent years—and candidates are on the lookout for the best ones. Everything from mental health benefits and childcare stipends to more flexible vacation/paid-time-off policies are becoming the standard. If you offer these benefits to your employees (and you should), give them prominent placement in your job posting. Your competition already is. 6. Listing too many job requirements A long list of job requirements can scare people away from applying to your position. Comb through your listing and ask yourself: How many of these skills are genuinely mandatory? Which skills can you teach employees on the job and are less critical to include? 7. Keeping pay a secret Pay is such a critical piece to why someone accepts a job, so having that conversation early on saves everyone a lot of time. You wouldn't want to spend all this time reviewing a resume, interviewing, and more just to find out the applicant isn't aligned to your pay range, right? Not only does transparency enable candidates to self-select out, it also gives you the opportunity to wow them if you have a competitive offer. 8. Being strict about how candidates can apply The more applicants the better. So, you don't want to bar anyone from submitting an application. That means accepting applicants who apply in store, online, or even via text message. Keeping track of applications pouring in from all different directions might sound overwhelming, but with an applicant tracking system , you can stay organized and reap other benefits like posting to multiple job boards at once. The importance of optimizing your job listings There are a lot of steps that go into creating the ideal QSR job listing. It needs to be searchable, scannable, personalized, and exciting. Check your open listings against the list above to ensure you're optimizing for applicants' eyes. Our free job description checklist makes it easy to cross-check each new job listing. And once your job listing is ready to go, learn how to promote it for extra reach.

It’s one of the things that separates the restaurants that are winning from the ones that aren’t. That’s why Dan Gertsacov, former CCO and global CMO of Focus Brands and now senior advisor with McKinsey & Company—who has an extensive background in both tech and restaurants, is helping franchisees develop their businesses in the technological space. “My path into the industry when I was young—literally twelve years old—I wanted to be a professional chef,” Dan says. “Once I attended culinary school, I realized how difficult of a profession it was. It was going to be a lifelong hobby, but not my profession.” Instead, he veered into media and technology via a career with Google. He helped the then-young internet company establish itself in Latin America and the Caribbean. Then a mentor, one of the largest QSR franchisees in the world, invited Dan back into the restaurant business as a chief marketing and digital officer. Some things stayed the same, however: he still spent his days helping organizations and teams grow through adversity. That held true when he became the CCO and global CMO of Focus Brands, and still now with McKinsey & Company. “My experience is anchored in digital,” Dan says. “How do you make money from it as a franchisee? How do you think about it strategically as a franchisor? Then how do you help organizations move through that?” Now, Dan’s hobby and his passion are part of his work. Although he’s not behind the grill, he cooks up ways for others to thrive in what he calls “this crazy, amazing industry.” We interviewed Dan about how QSRs can adapt to the challenges of the digital age and emerge as flexible, competitive players in the restaurant space. Your opportunities are new; your challenges are timeless Yes, the environment for restaurants has been challenging since the onset of COVID-19. But the restaurant space has always been challenging, Dan says—and the opportunities now are as big as they’ve ever been. “Some things have remained constant,” Dan says. “Everyone needs to eat. That is not changing. Everybody wants convenience. Everybody wants value for money.” The difference now is that restaurants must remain connected and relevant in a world that has gone digital. But it’s only the medium that has changed. These digital challenges facing QSRs right now are addressing the very same basic customer needs. Remember, Dan says, that the drive-thru was once an innovation for convenience—all we’re doing is creating new definitions for what customers want. “You don't need to be able to write software code to recognize that the world that we live in is connected to our phones,” Dan says. “We need to make food, serve food and run a business in a digital world.” Sure, it would be most convenient for a restaurant to maintain its existing model, but customers now want and expect to access anything from anywhere. How people find out about your food, how they order it, how they get it delivered—each has changed, and continues to change. The challenge—and the opportunity—for a QSR is to continue serving the constant need for great, hot food at a good price with a welcome experience, while adapting to the customer expectation for digital engagement. “The people who do that well are going to profit enormously,” Dan says, “and the people who struggle, who want to stay with the way it’s always been done, they’re going to find themselves on the outside looking in.” Establish foundations for digital growth Whenever Dan is talking with franchisees who are self-identified non-digital people, he simply points to both of their phones. “We are both here physically and virtually,” he says. “Every one of our customers’ experience is going to be both, too.” In order to make that experience a positive one for both the customer and the business, Dan establishes three foundations with franchisees adapting to the digital world: First foundation: Lean in and get curious. All this talk about evolving for a digital world is enough to freak out anyone without a software engineering pedigree—but Dan reminds us that the techy stuff doesn’t need to be so technical. “The nature of the technology we’re talking about, and understanding the trends, is learnable,” he says. “Digital is a tool. We do not need to be afraid of the tool. We need to have curiosity.” With that interest and willingness to learn, franchisees are capable of understanding a) the basics of what needs to be done, b) the business drivers to turn profit and c) who the players are—the platforms, the tools and the tech. “If I can understand the context I need to operate in, that’s a lot of the heavy lifting,” Dan says. Second foundation: Identify everyone’s roles. “Step two is making sure I understand my role and the role of the brand, the role of partners, the role of agencies,” Dan says. Most franchisees pay the franchisor for developing the brand, the color scheme, the logo design, the menu. A lot of digital initiatives may fold into this role. Franchisees, on the other hand, bring those things to life in the service. They do local store marketing and connect with the community. In the digital space, they might maintain a Facebook presence, post to Instagram, and create TikToks connected to but separate from the broader advertising strategy. This foundation extends to the team members you hire and the organizations you partner with. “I’ve got to hire a team that can lean in and adapt,” Dan says. “I’ve got to work with partners who are agile. I’ve got to work with brands who are adapting one step ahead. Do these people understand digital? Do they understand social media? Are they part of the trends?” Third foundation: Stay involved. Dan recognizes the possibility of outsourcing all of those digital responsibilities and more. “I have a ton of respect for all the third-party aggregators,” he says. “They’re really good at what they do. They’re great technology partners, great marketers. But the brand is responsible for the experience.” He draws a comparison with the airline industry. If a carrier pointed all customers to Expedia to book flights, pretty soon, Expedia has the leverage on that relationship. He sees the same thing happening in the restaurant industry. “We need to live in a world where consumers can choose to order from the brand or in a third-party marketplace,” Dan proposes. “We need to be in both spaces so that we don’t lose the connection with our own consumers.” Invest your attention in the digital space We asked Dan what areas franchisees in the QSR space should keep an eye on investing in, and he gave us cutting-edge answers that, at their core, are actually old-school ones. Respecting customer data. Holding information about your customers has entered a whole new realm, thanks to apps and digital loyalty programs. But customers have always offered up their information—which means, they have always trusted you to treat it responsibly, and to give them value for it. “We used to do this in a bowl with business cards: Put your card in, we’ll do a raffle, you’ll win lunch,” Dan says. “They were sharing their data with you by leaving their business card. Think about that the same way now: What’s the exchange? You have to respect that relationship.” Dan also reminds us that restaurants don’t truly “own” their customers’ email addresses and so on. The customer owns their info, and they should be able to opt out anytime. This adds extra incentive for you, the restaurant owner or franchisee, to offer them meaningful value in exchange for that access. Optimizing supply chain management. Again, supply chain management is nothing new in itself. Knowing what you have, how long you’ve had it, what you’re getting, and where you’re getting it: these are essential for any restaurant. But understanding that supply chain on a level that allows you to optimize it? “That is, I think, the next frontier in restaurant management,” Dan says. With improvements and developments in logistics, this space is ripe for advancement—and savvy franchisees will keep their mind open to this space. Relationships with staff. Okay, there’s not much revolutionary about the idea that healthy interpersonal relationships between team members—and particularly between managers and hourly staff—will boost retention and improve operations. But with his history in the tech space, Dan looks at actual, measurable ways that these benefits affect the bottom line. “The environment that you create to work in will differentiate the kind of consumer experience you have,” he says. His concrete example looks at QSRs in malls. The top factor that determines consumer demand in the food court is not the promotion or the menu; it’s how long the line is. And how long the line is depends on how well staffed the location is. “McDonald's can handle an incredible amount of throughput if they've got enough people in the kitchen, enough people serving customers,” Dan says. “But if they don't, if they misunderstood the demand, or don't have enough staff, a person goes somewhere else. They’re not serving that convenience—and it was a staffing decision.” Now the decision might be directly how many people a manager scheduled. But it could also be a result of the benefits package, or the nature of the work environment. “The number one thing is a relationship between the manager and the staff,” Dan says. “And these are decisions you get to choose. These feel like soft skills, but they lead directly to customer experience, which leads to traffic, average check, profit, all those things that everybody wants.” The key advice for growing your digital business Dan offers this in six words: Think big, start small, act fast. “The secret to McDonald's turnaround in so many countries was that we followed this very simple playbook,” he says. And best of all, it’s a growth mindset that any franchisee can adapt. Think big. For any brand, Dan sees stores (and people) that sell more, and ones that sell less. “The people who sell more, in my experience, are the ones that think bigger,” he says. Franchisees don’t need to think big on a brand level—big marketing campaigns and the like come from corporate. But living the values of the brand? That’s the big picture for a franchisee. “Really, it’s thinking about what’s going in my customers’ lives,” Dan says. “Am I pushing my brand to be more relevant with the food we offer, the advertising we do, the experience we’re creating?” So think big in the context of what it’s like to be your customers and what matters to them. Then, add that value. “I wouldn’t want to get three emails from me this week—let’s send one email,” Dan offers as an example. “And let’s not make it about the food. Let’s make it about what they’re going through getting ready for the holidays—things of that nature. That, for me, is thinking big.” Start small. Dan takes this piece of advice in two directions with the customer experience: the interacting-with-people side, and the physical-location side. “Start with your team,” he says in a callback to where QSRs should invest their efforts. “Do you have restaurant managers who people want to work for? Are you attracting crew members who people want to be served by?” Then, once you know you’ve hired quality people, reflect on whether you’ve trained them on everything they need not just to serve food to customers, but to truly be there to assist them. Questions about the menu, or how to order on the app? Franchises need to prepare team members for all these things. Plus, there’s the experience of the restaurant location itself. Dan sums it up this way: “The bathroom still needs to be cleaned. Your consumers see that stuff. That is where starting small creates the brand experience and makes it real in the restaurant.” When team members fail at these tasks, Dan identifies that as the franchisee’s responsibility. “Start small in these micro-interactions, these friction points,” he says. Act fast. Implementing big-thinking change doesn’t happen in a single bound. It’s made up of those small starts—pieces of the big picture which you can initiate and implement quickly, rather than stalling out or deliberating for ages. “Acting fast has to do with making incremental progress with the people you attract to your organization, the culture that you’re building,” Dan says. “Incremental progress over a long period of time adds up to an exponentially different experience for your consumers.” Final thought: Tough times are your chance to reposition yourself. Dan brings the interview around to its through-line: Times of heightened challenges, like a global pandemic or whatever disruptions come next, offer QSRs and other franchisees a prime opportunity to grow. Right now, that growth is largely digital. Later, it will be something we haven’t imagined yet. “Even in a tough situation, you can accelerate through and gain share,” Dan says. “That's what I've seen with the people who have leaned into digital in this pandemic. As we come out of the pandemic, they'll be better positioned than ever to adapt to a changing world.” TAGS People management Recruiting strategies Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

Share this article Competing for hourly workers has become increasingly challenging with the ever-tightening labor market. Hourly workers have more choices than ever before and financial wellness is on the forefront of their minds. With companies using creative marketing strategies to lure potential candidates, businesses are turning to innovative benefits, including offering same day pay via a dailypay app . Like other employees, hourly workers strive to meet the demands of their household budgets, but unfortunately, some struggle to make ends meet. According to a Bloomberg report , two out of five American adults do not have sufficient savings to cover even a $400 emergency, and one in five of the adults surveyed are not able to pay their current month's bills in full. Additionally, many hourly employees want immediate rewards and depend on regular cash flow rather than waiting the whole pay period for the direct deposit to hit that bank account . This is why some are turning to instant daily pay apps that are becoming more popular with both employees and employers. This blog post will explain why same day pay is an exciting benefit for hourly workers, how does daily pay work, common features found in dailypay apps , and more. Instant cash With a multitude of opportunities, tech-savvy job candidates are using social media, online reviews, and word-of-mouth to find the perfect job that suits their lifestyle as well as their wallets. Many hourly-worker candidates are millennials, who are comfortable using their phones and mobile apps to navigate their way into good-paying jobs offering some sense of fulfillment. But most importantly, hourly employees want access to their money and they want to get paid instantaneously, which is where apps like Instant Financial fill in the gap. Instant Financial offers employees access to their pay within minutes of clocking out of their shift. This daily pay app allows employees to withdraw half the pay they earn on a given day, limiting the money available to 50% of their paychecks, which encourages saving. Currently, about 250,000 employees serving close to 50 companies have access to the service, including franchisees of Outback Steakhouse, Dunkin' Donuts, and McDonald's. Instant Financial says that they have also attracted trucking companies and some retailers, and expect usage from about 1 million workers within the next two years. Other apps providing similar services include New York -based DailyPay , which launched its service in August 2015. The DailyPay app has about 500,000 users, and charges workers a fee of $1.25 to $2.99 per use, depending on how quickly they'd like to gain access to the funds—immediately or the next day. Like similar apps, DailyPay allows employees to access their paychecks before their company-set payday . Employees are enjoying the convenience of accessing their dailypay available balance on a daily basis, with long-lasting appeal. How does daily pay work? Any perk an employer can offer its employees likely lengthens the time an employee stays and increases employee engagement . In a stiff, competitive environment, adding a convenient way for employees to access their pay early only strengthens an organization's employee base. The way that these daily pay apps work is that they allow employees to request up to 50% of their current day's pay within an hour after their shift ends. The funds go into a debit account that the worker can immediately use as needed, providing instant cash for the employee to (hopefully) use responsibly. The benefits are enormous, particularly compared to the other alternatives for employees that exist today. With on-demand pay platforms, employees are less likely to seek short-term lending options, such as those at payday lenders. These institutions prey on hourly workers seeking instant relief from the pressure of bill collectors or the desire for a new car, furniture, bling, etc. When employees know they can access their pay immediately at the end of their shift, they are less likely to borrow at exorbitant interest rates and therefore are under less pressure and stress. This creates a healthier emotional and pay cycle. Several companies using same day pay apps are experiencing tremendous results regarding employee retention . One example is the Caspers Company - the owner of 53 McDonald's franchises in Tampa, Fla., that found that its employee turnover rate decreased by almost 10% over the previous year since the company adopted the instant pay app service, according to a recent USAToday article . A recent Bloomberg Business week piece also reported that employee turnover has decreased at Hoover Foods since Wendy's franchisee introduced the Instant Financial app to its employees. These apps take the burden off the employer because the app provider does all of the work. The minimal fees vary, with some institutions charging the employee, some the employer, and some both. The good news is that the product has already been tried and tested, and is being used by companies such as Chili's, Papa John's, McDonald's, Flemming's, Bonefish Grill, Carrabba's, and Taco Bell with much success. Is there a downside to DailyPay DailyPay , like any financial service, comes with its pros and cons. One potential downside is the cost associated with using DailyPay , as it may charge fees or a percentage of the amount being accessed. These fees can add up over time, reducing the total amount of your paycheck. Additionally, some users might find it tempting to withdraw money frequently, leading to poor financial management habits. It's crucial to use DailyPay responsibly and not rely on it as a long-term solution for financial stability. Lastly, not all employers offer DailyPay as an option, so it might not be available to everyone. It's essential to weigh the costs and benefits to decide if it's the right fit for your financial situation. Does DailyPay work with my job It’s hard to say which companies have the employee benefit of DailyPay . Some payroll teams prioritize things like DailyPay while others prioritize other healthcare , paid leave, and vacation days over it. The industry in which the business is in will impact whether or not DailyPay is part of the benefits package. Is there a catch with DailyPay While DailyPay can provide employees with flexibility in accessing their earned wages, there are some potential catches to consider. First, not all employers offer DailyPay as a benefit, so it's essential to check if your workplace supports this service. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, there can be fees associated with using DailyPay , reducing the amount of your paycheck which is why staying on top of your DailyPay balance is always very important. Furthermore, DailyPay is not a long-term solution for financial issues, and over-reliance on it can lead to financial instability. It’s not a magic debit card that never runs out of money and users should approach it as a short-term solution for immediate financial needs. Overall, the \"catch\" with DailyPay lies in understanding its limitations and costs while using it responsibly. Financially Stable Employees Debt is crippling American workers and part of it is attributed to the fact that workers cannot access their earned income when they need it. When employees turn to payday loans or max out their credit cards , it causes stress, which creates poor performance on the job. A recent Pew Research report found that interest from payday loans alone costs Americans more than $9 billion annually, overdraft fees come to another $15 billion, and credit card debt is way over $931 billion! By providing employees access to their DailyPay account , you provide a platform for employees to control their financial destinies, reducing stress while creating a more engaged workforce. Conclusion In conclusion let’s answer the question, how does DailyPay work ? Simply put, DailyPay allows an employee to access a certain amount of their current day’s pay. This is beneficial to hourly employees and can help with real-time purchases and hopefully ease financial stress if used responsibly. DailyPay is also beneficial to franchisees because it can help improve employee retention and employee experience.

The purpose of an HRMS is to automate and streamline human resources-related tasks, such as payroll processing , benefits administration , and personnel tracking. In this article, we will provide an in-depth look at HRMSs and discuss the key features that you should look for when choosing a system for your business. What is an HRMS ? As we mentioned above, an HRMS is a software application for hr management designed to automate and streamline human resources-related tasks. The core purpose of an HRMS is to help businesses manage employee data more efficiently. By automating HR processes , businesses can save time and money on administrative tasks, and they can focus on more strategic initiatives. HRMS will often times also lead to retention within the HR department . There are a number of different types of HRMS systems , modules , and apps on the market, and they vary in terms of features and functionality. Some HRMS systems are designed for specific industries, while others offer more general-purpose tools. When choosing an HRMS system for your business, it’s important to consider your business’ specific needs and requirements. HRIS vs. HRMS While many people use the terms HRIS and HRMS interchangeably, there is a difference between the two. An HRIS ( Human Resources Information System ) is a system that stores core HR employee data . An HRMS , on the other hand, is a system that helps you manage that employee data . In other words, an HRIS is a database of employee information , while an HRMS is a tool that you use to manipulate and act on that data. Most HRMS will include an HRIS component, as employee data is the foundation of any HR system . However, not all HRIS systems will offer the same level of functionality as an HRMS . When evaluating HRMS , it’s important to consider the features and tools that each system offers. History of HRMS Human Resource Management Systems can be traced back to the 1970s when the first attempts to automate payroll functions were put into practice real-time . These primitive systems would lay the groundwork for the development of more sophisticated HRMS in the years to follow. PeopleSoft introduced one of the first comprehensive HRMS in the 1980s which included elements like recruiting, attendance, and even benefits administration . By the year 2000, the practice had finally hit mainstream relevance within corporate structures as direct deposit and employee self-service had become fully adopted. And since then, the HRMS market has continued to grow and evolve. New technologies, such as cloud computing and mobile devices, are changing the way businesses operate and requiring HRMS to evolve with changing customer needs. As the needs of businesses change, so too will the HRMS that they use. Types of Human Resource Management Systems There are several different types of HRMS on the market, and they vary in terms of features and functionality. Some HRMS are designed for specific industries, while others offer more general-purpose tools. When choosing an HRMS for your business, it’s important to consider your specific needs and requirements. Industry-specific HRMS Some Human Resource Management Systems are designed for specific industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing, or retail. These systems offer industry-specific features and tools that can be helpful for businesses in those industries. For example, a healthcare HRMS might include tools for managing compliance with HIPAA regulations. General-purpose HRMS Other HRMS offer more general-purpose tools that can be used by businesses in any industry. These systems might not include industry-specific features, but they can still be helpful for businesses of all types. Cloud-based HRMS Another type of HRMS is cloud-based HRMS . Cloud-based systems are hosted by the vendor, and they can be accessed via the internet. Cloud-based HRMS can be helpful for businesses that don’t have the resources to host their own HRMS . On-premises HRMS On-premises HRMS are hosted on the customer’s own servers. On-premises systems can be helpful for businesses that want to have more control over their HRMS . Open-source HRMS Open-source HRMS are free to use, and they can be customized to meet the needs of your business. Open-source HRMS are typically hosted on the customer’s own servers. Proprietary HRMS Proprietary HRMS are developed and owned by a single vendor. Proprietary systems are typically not customizable, and they may be more expensive than other types of HRMS . Why companies should invest in HRMS There is a difference between HRMS software companies and companies utilizing an HRMS . An HRMS can automate and streamline a few different HR functions , including payroll, benefits administration , and performance management . By automating these processes, an HRMS can save businesses time and money. In addition, an HRMS can help businesses manage their workforce better. Benefits of implementing an HRMS There are many benefits you can expect to see when you implement an HRMS . These benefits include: Better, data-driven insights One of the clearest benefits of an HRMS is the ability to gain insights into your workforce that were not possible before. With an HRMS , you can track employee data and use that data to make better decisions about your workforce. This will help with talent management and improve metrics for new hires as well as tenured employees. Improved compliance Compliance is a never-ending struggle when it comes to HR. By automating HR processes with an HRMS , you can ensure compliance and do away with errors that come about via a manual approach. Reduced costs An HRMS can help reduce the costs associated with HR functions , such as payroll and benefits administration . In addition, an HRMS can help you better manage your workforce, which can lead to reduced turnover and improved productivity. Improved employee satisfaction An HRMS can help to improve employee satisfaction by automating HR processes (like performance reviews ) and making it easier for employees to access the information they need. In addition, an HRMS can help you better manage your workforce, which can lead to improved employee morale. Small business HRMS for small business owners is very effective and allows organization and time savings when a small business owner is short on bandwidth. Freeing up this time that a business owner would normally be spending on HR can mean more time for strategy and more needle-moving activities. What are the key functions of an HRMS ? While HRMS can vary and will certainly have some level of individuality, there are some core functions you can usually expect. Workforce management Perhaps the cornerstone of any decent HRMS is a workforce management function. This refers to the general overseeing of your workforce and would include everything from development to discipline. Why it matters: Workforce management is critical for every business. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your workforce and can help you to save time and money. Payroll HRMS payroll software is another key function of an HRMS is payroll management. This refers to the process of managing employee pay, including calculating wages, taxes, and deductions. While this may be as simple as basic payroll records, it can be as complex as managing employee stock options and benefits and even calculating taxation. Why it matters: Payroll is one of the most important aspects of HR. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage payroll and can help you to save time and money. Employee management Employee management refers to what most people would consider when they think about HR functions . This would encompass everything from reporting on the relationship between employees and management to the basic structure of your employee’s work life, such as which office they use. Why it matters: Employee management is critical for every business. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your workforce and can help you improve employee morale. Recruitment The process of recruitment can be a daunting one, but an HRMS can make it much simpler. This would include everything from posting job ads to conducting interviews and managing the hiring process. Why it matters: Recruitment is a critical part of HR. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your recruitment process and can help you to find the best candidates for your business. Employee engagement Employee engagement is a relatively new term, but it’s gaining a lot of traction in the HR world. Employee engagement refers to the level of connection an employee feels to their work and their company. This can be anything from job satisfaction to company loyalty. Why it matters: Employee engagement is critical for every business. A good HRMS can help you to improve employee engagement and can lead to improved employee morale. What are the key features of an HRMS ? Now that we’ve provided clarity on the overriding functions of HRMS , let’s look at the individual features you can expect from an HRMS . Reporting and analytics One of the most important features of an HRMS is reporting and analytics. The system should provide you with data that can help you to make decisions about your workforce. This data can be anything from employee productivity to turnover rates. Why it matters: Reporting and analytics are critical for every business. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your workforce and can help you to save time and money. Centralized employee records A basic feature that you can expect from most HRMS is the ability to store employee records in a centralized location. This is important because it helps to streamline the process of managing employee data . Why it matters: Having a centralized database of employee information can save you a lot of time and hassle. It also means that you can easily access employee records from anywhere in the world. Performance management Another key feature of an HRMS is performance management . This refers to the ability of the system to help you track and manage employee performance . This can include anything from setting goals to tracking progress. Why it matters: Performance management is important for any business that wants to improve employee productivity. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage employee performance and can help you to improve your bottom line. Time and attendance tracking Many HRMS also offer time and attendance tracking features. This refers to the ability of the system to track when employees start and finish work, as well as their break times. Why it matters: Time and attendance tracking are important for any business that wants to improve employee productivity. A good HRMS will make it easier to track employee hours and can help you to save time and money. Benefits administration Another common feature of HRMS is benefits administration . This refers to the ability of the system to help you manage employee benefits. This can include anything from health insurance to pension plans. Why it matters: Benefits administration is important for any business that wants to attract and retain the best employees. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage employee benefits and can help you to save time and money. Employee self-service Many HRMS also offer employee self-service features. This refers to the ability of employees to access their own records and update their information. Why it matters: Employee self-service is important for any business that wants to improve employee productivity. A good HRMS will make it easier for employees to update their information and can help you to save time and money. HMRS security Security is a major concern for any business that stores data. This becomes even more salient when it involves the personal data of employees like social security numbers and addresses. A data breach would not only raise all kinds of compliance issues but can genuinely harm your employees. That's why it's so important to consider the following security concerns when you prepare to implement an HRMS . Data encryption: One way to protect your data is to encrypt it. That means that even if someone were to gain access to your systems, they would not be able to read the data without the encryption key. Data backups: Another way to protect your data is to have multiple backups in different locations. That way, if one backup is compromised, you still have others to fall back on. Restrict access: It's important to restrict access to your HRMS to only those who absolutely need it. That way, if someone does gain unauthorized access, they will not be able to do as much damage. Two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of security that requires someone to not only know a password but also have physical access to a device like a cell phone to log in. This makes it much harder for someone to gain unauthorized access to your systems. Update regularly: It's important to keep your HRMS up to date with the latest security patches. That way, you can be sure you're as protected as possible from the latest threats. Strong password policies: Finally, it's important to have strong password policies in place. That means requiring employees to use passwords that are long, complex, and unique. How to ensure success when implementing a new HRMS ? If you've been convinced that adopting an HRMS is a necessary upgrade for your business, you've made the right decision. But how can you be sure that your implementation will be successful? Here is a checklist of best practices to follow to ensure success when implementing a new HRMS : Define your goals The first step is to define your goals. What do you hope to achieve by implementing a new HRMS ? Do you want to improve employee productivity? Save time and money? Attract and retain the best employees? Do your research The next step is to do your research. There are a lot of different HRMS on the market, so it's important to find one that will meet your needs. Be sure to read reviews and compare features before making your final decision. Consider your scope HRMS are not a one size fits all solution. It's important to consider the scope of your project and find a system that will meet your specific needs. Some Human Resource Management Systems are broad and comprehensive and will essentially take over a function of your business. But on the other hand, you can find systems that are more limited and focused on one particular area. Get buy-in from stakeholders Another important step is to get buy-in from stakeholders. That means getting the support of upper management and ensuring they understand the benefits of an HRMS . Create a plan Once you've gotten buy-in from stakeholders, it's time to create a plan. This should include a timeline, budget , and a list of key milestones. Train your employees Once you've selected a system, it's important to train your employees on how to use it. A good HRMS will have training materials available, but you may also want to consider hiring a consultant to help with this process. Implement gradually You don't have to go live with your new HRMS all at once. In fact, it might be better to start with a small group of employees and then expand gradually. This will give you time to work out any kinks and make sure that everyone is properly trained. Monitor and adjust Finally, it's important to monitor your new HRMS and adjust as necessary. Pay attention to how employees are using the system and whether they're finding it helpful. If you see any problems, don't hesitate to make changes. Summary HRMS are a necessary upgrade for any business that wants to improve its human resources management. By automating HR processes , these systems can save time and money while also improving employee productivity.

This software’s main aim is to improve a business’s overall efficiency and productivity by automating certain repetitive and manual tasks, freeing up time for human resource teams, and allowing them to focus on more pertinent tasks. The added bandwidth can come in handy for addressing business critical and strategic tasks in the HR management function. A typical cloud-based HRMS software takes care of every HRIS element and also offers human capital management system capabilities. The two main characteristics of online HRMS software include time and labor management and payroll. What is an HRMS Payroll Software An HRMS payroll software’s main function is to calculate salaries, withhold the right amount of deductions and taxes and take care of printing the paychecks and delivering them. If you optimize an HRMS program for your business, you can greatly cut down on the time and manual workload needed to carry out numerous tasks. Some HRMS applications also have web-based SAAS features, which can come in quite handy for managing an organization's HR duties effectively. If you have to choose between an HRMS with payroll features or a payroll-based ERP system, you must consider a few factors, advantages, and disadvantages. What Makes HRMS Payroll Software Different from other Systems An HRMS payroll solution offers clear advantages. Here are some of the main ones: Straightforward access to reward and compensation data In most cases, HRMS payroll software doesn’t require too much data input. This is particularly true if the system already has the information you are looking for. You simply have to set the software up to access it It can reduce overheads and staffing time to a great extent The solution makes sure that businesses do not have to rely on spreadsheets, files, and databases The HRMS software solution you choose greatly depends on your organization’s needs. However, there are certain factors that will influence your decision. User Experience UX is a vital part of any software. Can it process information in a quick and timely manner? Is it easy to use? Can it be updated seamlessly? Do they offer convenience to users? These are the things you need to consider when making your decision. Integration Whether your payroll is part of a separate module or a standalone HRMS, it requires access to the right data to operate properly. This means integration, be it through easy access to the data present in sister systems or a part of a singular package. What’s more important to straightforward access to data is that the system should be able to follow through on certain actions or events. For instance, booking someone to a training event would take them off their work schedule automatically and also take care of consequences related to pay. Advantages and Disadvantages of an HRMS Payroll Software An online HRMS software for payroll offers more advantages than disadvantages. Let us discuss some of them: Advantages Compatibility When a business’ entire data is in the same system and all of the bank accounts, names, numbers, staffing details, etc are up to date, there is a significant reduction in payroll-related errors. A common payroll error that companies encounter is the possibility of under or overpayment. The presence of HRMS payroll software can help organizations steer clear of such issues. Secure Data Payroll records usually contain a lot of sensitive information, which includes things like salary figures, bank account details, social security numbers, and whatnot. Keeping this data in a safe, secure location minimizes the risk of data loss or security breaches. Compliance Another advantage of cloud-based HRMS software is its improved regulatory and legislative compliance. The right human resource management system can also help companies comply with labor law changes, ensuring they can steer clear of scrutiny-related troubles. Accurate Data Merely integrating HRMS software for payrolls can significantly reduce errors. The lesser the errors, the more time staff members will spend focusing on pertinent tasks instead of taking care of those errors. The right cloud-based HRMS system can also greatly reduce the chances of deliberate errors. Since the system is in charge of the administration of attendance, timesheets, etc, it can maintain accurate records, minimizing the chances of fraud, theft, and whatnot. Single Portal Access Accessing HR related systems from the same point significantly improves user experience. Whether it is an employee who wants to check their salary or a higher-up who wants data and figures for their next board meeting, an HRMS payroll software offers easy information access to anyone in an organization, which saves time and offers a great deal of convenience. Productivity Boost HRMS software can be massive productivity boosters for employees, managers and HR staff. In today’s disruptive and fiercely competitive work environment, workers should be spending most of their time on valuable tasks instead of repetitive ones. Adopting digitization and automation in the form of an HRMS payroll software can help boost productivity, helping employees focus on activities that generate profit. Up to Date Data The accuracy of HRMS databases makes it a worthy option for almost any organization. With personnel file management becoming more demanding than ever, it is important to have accurate automated solutions. A reliable HRMS software can maintain employee records, keeping them up to date and reduce various administrative burdens faced by human resource departments. Disadvantages The Cost to Set up May be High While there is no denying that integrating a cloud based HRMS software is usually a great thing and helps businesses save long term costs, making the shift can be slightly expensive. For instance, getting a new system usually means providing staff members in-depth training to ensure they can use it properly. Similar to incorporating most technologies, it is important to make sure that the investment has a likelihood of paying off. Not Every Department May be on Board Initially Larger companies often have different departments that handle their payroll. In such cases, there is a high likelihood that each department uses a different payroll system, has different attitudes, priorities and whatnot. Bringing different departments together to ensure they use the same system can initially result in miscommunication, resistance and troubles. Becoming Overly Dependent on One thing While dealing with a single vendor and system can offer a lot of convenience and is not too complicated, it makes companies quite over reliant. For example, if an HRMS payroll software ends up crashing or facing any other issue, it could affect business continuity. It’s clear to see that an online HRMS payroll software offers more advantages than disadvantage, making them ideal for most businesses. People Also Ask What is HRMS Payroll Software? An HRMS payroll system automates an organization’s fundamental administrative tasks. The most important task performed by this software is converting manual filings and tasks to an electronic filing system. A transition like this helps reduce information related errors, leaks and losses. Additionally, a payroll software can automate the procedure of paying salaries according to monthly, hourly or monthly basis without any errors. Besides salaries, an HRMS payroll software can also file employee’s taxes, deliver checks, calculate wages complete insurance payment, direct deposit etc. Does HRMS Include Payroll? While most HRMS are come with payroll management features, some of them do not. So, if you want to improve your company’s HR processes and automate certain payroll related tasks to make them more efficient and accurate, it would be best to get an HRMS software solution that has payroll management features. What are the Best HRMS Software?

Here are a few things to keep in mind when choosing an HRMS software for your business: Ease of use A system can have every feature available but if your team can't use it, they won't. That's why it's so important to choose a system that is easy to use. Compatibility and Integration Before you commit to HRMS software, make sure that it's compatible with your current systems and software. You don't want to invest in a system only to find out later that it can't integrate with the rest of your infrastructure. Scalability As your business grows, you'll need a system that can grow with you. Make sure to choose a system that is scalable so that you don't have to reinvest in a new one every time your business hits a growth spurt. Features and Functionality When you're looking for an HRMS system for your business, it's important to consider both the ease of use and the functionality of the software. Not all businesses have the same needs, so while one company may want a comprehensive system that can do everything from payroll to performance reviews , another company may only need a system that can handle employee onboarding but to a more focused degree. Cost Businesses have different budget constraints, so it’s important to find a system that fits within your budget. This may mean finding HRMS software that only offers the essentials for your business to ensure the pricing is acceptable. Similarly, you need to find a service that can grow with you as your business develops without ballooning your costs.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 02/02/22 Using Glassdoor to boost your employment reputation Share this article QSR leaders are becoming increasingly interested in employer review websites to ensure their reputation is held in high regard amongst job seekers. From a human resources perspective, businesses—restaurants included—are built on the genuine level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction of employees with their employers. No amount of employment-related advertising can change the reality of the boots-on-the-ground experience of employees. Because of this, it’s imperative that leaders strive to build the employment aspect of their brand authentically by maintaining a culture of employee appreciation. QSR employees are using Glassdoor More and more employees in the QSR space are flocking to Glassdoor to leave reviews. These first-hand reviews reflect employee happiness and satisfaction—showing what it’s really like to work for your business. While the idea of receiving candid feedback from your employees on Glassdoor may be somewhat unsettling due to its public nature, there are also many benefits. The benefits of employee reviews on Glassdoor An effective way to establish a strong reputation as a great QSR to work for is through your employee reviews. A positive review from an employee goes further than you might think. It’s easy for employees to air out their frustrations on a review site, but for someone to take the time to express their genuine appreciation for their employer—that takes a lot of intention, often driven by a deeply meaningful experience. Employees often take to Glassdoor reviews when they want to be heard. So, as a leader, Glassdoor reviews can provide you with an objective view into your company culture. This objectivity will allow you to gauge if your employees’ experiences are in line with your organization’s culture and aspirations—and empower you to make changes if and as needed. Let’s take a closer look at four specific benefits of employee reviews on Glassdoor: 1. Employee morale One of the best ways to boost the morale of your hourly workforce is to invite them to leave reviews on Glassdoor. By encouraging your employees to leave reviews, you’re making it clear that their opinion is valued. When employees feel valued, team morale increases. 2. Employee insights When employees use a third-party review website such as Glassdoor, they are more likely to be genuine with their feedback. It removes a layer of fear caused by the possible repercussions of sharing the feedback directly with their managers. The genuine nature of Glassdoor feedback allows QSR leaders to gain a more accurate understanding of the day-to-day experience of their employees. This increased transparency allows managers to make better decisions about the future of company culture. 3. Prospective candidates When prospective candidates read transparent reviews of your restaurant on Glassdoor, they get a better sense of what it’s really like to work at your organization. When candidates feel they truly understand your brand and store culture from an employment perspective, they are more likely to show up to the interview more engaged and eager to land the job. 4. Balance Glassdoor asks that all employees provide both positive and negative feedback. The results? A balanced review that helps job seekers see all the great and the areas for improvement. Every employer has strengths and weaknesses, and by openly showing that to your candidates, you’re giving them the opportunity to see whether the job is a fit—and even a glimpse into the areas they could come in and immediately make an impact. While there are many benefits to receiving reviews on Glassdoor, there is one main challenge facing QSRs on Glassdoor: Getting employees to leave reviews. Best practices for getting more Glassdoor reviews Getting your employees to leave feedback about your restaurant on Glassdoor isn’t always easy. Most reviews left on Glassdoor without prompting by the employer are either extremely positive or extremely negative. If you don’t encourage your employees to leave reviews, you’re not likely to get reviews that are fully balanced and accurate. QSRs that receive a lot of balanced reviews on Glassdoor put considerable effort into implementing a review collection strategy. Here are four best practices QSRs are using to get as many balanced employee experience reviews on Glassdoor as possible: 1. Don’t overlook new hires Your new hires often bring genuine enthusiasm to your organization. They can provide great reviews of your restaurant—especially once they complete their onboarding. As a leader, you should ask your new hires to leave Glassdoor reviews of their hiring and training experience, and then again after they’ve been on the job for 90 days (to update their review). 2. Train hiring managers to ask for reviews Hiring managers are uniquely positioned to encourage employees to leave Glassdoor reviews. For example, when your team is undertaking a large hiring campaign, they can request reviews so that job candidates have accurate, trust-building information about your QSR’s culture. The best way to ensure that this practice remains a focus for hiring managers is by having them set a twice-yearly calendar reminder to request Glassdoor reviews from their employees. 3. Use review request templates Glassdoor provides leaders with customizable email templates within their Glassdoor Employer Center Account. You can customize these email templates and send them to your employees in order to generate more reviews on Glassdoor. Glassdoor also provides shareable links that you can use in any digital channel that you choose. These shareable links prompt employees to start the Glassdoor review process when clicked. 4. Request Glassdoor reviews during employee performance reviews QSRs are using employee performance review meetings as an opportunity to ask for Glassdoor reviews. Performance review meetings are timely occasions to ask for reviews because of the relevancy of reflecting on the past year of employees’ experiences with your company. By asking for Glassdoor reviews in employee performance review meetings, you’re also showing your employees that you care as much about their feedback as you do your feedback on their job performance. QSRs must respond to Glassdoor reviews promptly Once leaders make the effort to generate balanced Glassdoor reviews, the reviews will start to come in. It’s vital that QSR leaders respond to all employee reviews on Glassdoor promptly. By responding to reviews promptly, you show your employees that you truly care and you show job seekers that you foster a positive culture they’ll want to join. Promptly responding to Glassdoor reviews also shows potential job candidates that your organization is responsive and values employees’ opinions. This responsiveness makes your restaurant more attractive to potential job candidates. The process of creating and implementing a Glassdoor review generation strategy can be daunting at first. However, the effort pays off in the long term because of the positive impact it has on company culture and recruitment of future talent.

Or maybe you've wondered how much is a Chick-fil-A franchise from an investment standpoint? The franchise costs could be as low as $10,000! Compare that to initial investment for a McDonald’s franchise, which can cost more than $1 million! Franchise opportunities within Chick-fil-A are undeniably intriguing. The fast food chain industry generates $570 billion annually . And it’s expected to grow to $931 billion by 2027! So, why wouldn't someone want to franchise a Chick-fil-A? opening a Chick-fil-A franchise sounds like a great business opportunity! Well, there are a few more considerations when exploring how to open a Chick-fil-A franchise. For one, the franchise selection process is extremely tough. Less than 1% of people who apply to become a Chick-fil-A franchisee actually succeed. So, if you want a chance at being one of the few selected to franchise a Chick-fil-A, you need to be prepared. And that’s what we’re going to help you do in this blog post! Specifically, we’ll be walking through what to expect from each stage of the selection process. But, before we get into that, let’s go over some key information to help you decide if learning how to open a Chick-fil-A franchise is even worth your time and effort. What to Know Before Applying to Open a Chick-fil-A Franchise Among all the other fast food franchises you could open, Chick-fil-A stands out. But what is the Chick-fil-A franchise process and is it difficult to open a Chick-fil-A? One of the Toughest Selection Processes in the Industry Given the low franchise fee of $10,000, you would think that it would be easy to become a Chick-fil-A franchise owner . However, as mentioned above, Chick-fil-A selects its franchisees very carefully. The selection process can take anywhere between 12 to 24 months! And during that time, you’ll go through multiple rounds of interviews and assessments. Why? Because Chick-fil-A isn’t looking for someone who wants to earn a quick buck. Instead, they want people who are entrepreneurial, business-savvy, hands-on and dedicated to managing the restaurant full-time , six days a week. Chick-fil-A Does Most of the Work for You Thanks to the glorious business model , the business essentially runs itself and you will have minimal involvement in the background operations. Chick-fil-A manages and makes most operational decisions for you, from choosing the location to purchasing the equipment. On top of that, they are also in charge of customer relations, maintenance, and marketing. What are you in charge of? The day-to-day tasks involved with running the business, such as managing the staff and hiring new employees . This is Not a Passive Investment Chick-fil-A expects the business owners to invest more than just the franchise opening fees. They want a franchisee that is willing to dedicate serious time and energy to the business. For that reason, during the application process , you’ll be expected to demonstrate that you are a strong leader with relevant business and management skills. Being a good franchise operator is just as important to Chick-fil-A as things like money in your pocket or net worth . Chick-fil-A Decides the Location of the Franchise Chick-fil-A has strict control over the expansion of its fast food chain . They decide the future locations of restaurants based on the company’s goals. Currently, they focus their growth strategy on just 28 states. You can check out which locations Chick-fil-A considers emerging markets on their website. There, they list which states they are focusing on for the next 12-24 months. There are Additional Ongoing Fees According to QSR Magazine , Chick-fil-A has an average per-unit sales of $4.2 million. This is impressive given that Chick-fil-A restaurants only run six days a week. As a franchise owner , you’d be expected to pay 15% royalty fees on top of 50% net profit. But, according to The Hustle , a franchisee could earn around $600,000 annually. Given that most investments are taken care of by Chick-fil-A , this is still a great deal. How to Open A Chick-fil-A Franchise (5 Key Steps) So, you’ve read through the key facts and still want to apply to open a Chick-fil-A franchise? Great! But here’s an overview of what you’ll need to do. Step 1: Attend an Information Session  about how to open a Chick-fil-A This first step is optional. But we still recommend starting here. Why? Because the Chick-fil-A franchise model is different from other quick service restaurants . As mentioned above, you should not go into this venture with the idea that it will be a passive investment. Chick-fil-A expects you to commit 100% in the daily operations as a franchise owner . And you’ll have a better chance of articulating that commitment during the interviews and assessments by attending one of their information sessions. These information sessions will help you understand each part of Chick-fil-A ’s extensive application and interview process. You'll also have the opportunity to hear from current franchisees and members of the franchisee selection team. They are currently hosting information sessions online due to COVID-19. You can find information about how to register for an upcoming information session by clicking here . Step 2: Submit an Expression of Interest About Owning a Chick-fil-A Remember how the selection process can take anywhere between 12 to 24 months? Well, that process starts with simply completing an “Expression of Interest” form. You’ll need to start by submitting your email address. But, when you get the form, you’ll be asked for basic information that Chick-fil-A will use to determine if you’re potentially a good fit. Step 3: Complete a Follow-Up Application If you’re selected to move forward in the application process , you’ll be invited to submit a follow-up application that will ask for more detailed information regarding your: Personal finances Work experience Educational background Leadership style Community engagement In this phase, Chick-fil-A will then process and prioritize your application based on their needs and strategy in their target markets. In your follow-up application, you’ll also have the opportunity to indicate your geographical preference for a franchise location. As mentioned previously, Chick-fil-A wants to give back to the communities surrounding their franchises. So, mentioning any personal connection to the community you hope to serve may get you extra brownie points. Step 4: Prepare for Virtual and In-Person Interviews If you pass step 3, you’ll then be asked to participate in several rounds of interviews that can take more than a year to complete. Those interviews will take place by phone, via video chat, and in person. This robust process is designed to review you holistically and make sure you’re capable of representing Chick-fil-A ’s company values and mission. According to reviews on Glassdoor , if you make it to the first in-person interview, your family might even be invited for the interviews to verify your character and credentials. You should also expect to answer one question in particular several times throughout the entire interview process. \"Why do you want to own a Chick-fil-A franchise restaurant?\" According to the executive director of franchisee selection for Chick-fil-A , your answer should change and mature throughout the interview process. The Atlanta -based franchisor does a lot of things well. One is the chicken sandwich and the other is vetting out their franchisees. Step 5: Attend a Training Program for New Chick-fil-A Franchisees If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You’ve been selected to be one of the very few people who get to open a Chick-fil-A . Your final step (before the real work begins) will be to attend a 6-week training program for new Chick-fil-A franchise owners . In this program, you’ll learn things like: How to make the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwiches Legal aspects of running the franchise How to find and hire employees Business development Accounting At the end of the training, you’ll also be paired with a mentor who is a successful Chick-fil-A franchise owner and get a chance to visit their location. Final Thoughts Opening your own Chick-fil-A franchise may not be the most expensive route to running your own quick service restaurant . But it’s definitely one of the most competitive! If you’ve decided that you’d like to give it a shot, we hope that the information we’ve shared on how to open a Chick-fil-A franchise helps prepare you for the lengthy application process that awaits.

Many businesses have been severely impacted, and had to adapt and pivot their business models to meet the changing consumer demands as a result of heightened safety measurements and fears of the virus. The Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) industry was not spared - from the prohibition of on-premise dining to a 21.2% year-on-year decline for sales in F&B in 2020, and even the impending hiring crisis . With these challenges came a need to revisit their business strategies, which was mostly fueled by the adoption of digitization. Based on Panasonic's survey of 150 food services and food retailer decision-makers, 100% of those surveyed reported that the pandemic has intensified their sense of urgency to adopt transformational technology. 71% stated that digital transformation is far more important than any other factor, for business agility. Here are several key learnings about how Covid-19 has spurred digitization, with real-life case studies of restaurants that have taken it in their stride, and utilized technology trends to drive sales and recruitment. These learnings could also be incorporated into the context of your own QSR, and we hope that they'll inspire you to take a step towards digitization. Reducing Interaction and Contact In light of the increase in safe-distancing measures, more emphasis is placed on limiting social contact in order to create a more Covid-19-safe environment. Many QSRs have thus restructured or rolled out new strategies to tap into a wider market, while also reassuring customers that they will be safe. Drive-thru lanes As customers are wary of entering restaurants, Covid-19 has opened up a significant market for drive-thru orders. Large QSRs such as Chipotle and McDonald's are rolling out drive-thru lanes , to encourage digital orders. Chipotle created its 100th Chipotlane , in hopes of serving its mobile-order customers more quickly. McDonald's is even going the extra mile by investing more than $300 million in artificial intelligence in hopes of spurring more spend while customers visit their drive-thrus. Delivery and curbside pickup For smaller QSRs who may not have the capabilities or resources for drive-thrus, delivery and curbside pickups are a great alternative, which opens up the business to a wider market, especially with dine-in restrictions. Additionally, since customers are increasingly busy, with less time in between their commute or lunch breaks, they may also choose to eat on the go, making this a much more convenient option for them. By exploring avenues that allow customers to pre-order their food and drop by to collect the food only when it's ready, wait times are reduced, and order accuracy is increased. QSRs can thus effectively cater to this segment in the market. Digital menus and contactless payment Menus are often passed through many hands throughout the day and could be a potential source of virus transmission. Additionally, 82% of consumers worldwide view contactless payments as a cleaner way to pay', with 74% opting to continue their use of contactless payment post-pandemic. Many restaurants are investing in contactless payment solutions , through QR codes, and even tableside ordering technology. Provide customers with a platform to view the menu, place their order, make payment, and leave feedback, all in one place with services such as GoTab, that offer contactless ordering via a QR code. Spurring Online Purchase Customers are increasingly turning to their mobile devices to make orders, especially with the rise of mobile applications and online delivery. Many brands have leveraged this trend to spur online purchases, through the following: Creating brand-specific mobile applications and promoting them Americans increasingly downloading mobile applications for online shopping and food delivery creates an opportunity for third-party delivery apps like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and more. But this doesn't mean brands can't create their own mobile applications too especially since 80% of people surveyed by Market Force Information are turning to brands they trust during the pandemic when making restaurant purchases. Further, 43% have ordered from fast-food applications in the past six months, which highlights the importance of a mobile ordering platform, especially during these times. That being said, Domino's has proven to be a successful business case with their strong mobile application, as digital sales account for more than 80% of their sales . They have also increased their ad spend by 9.7% , while Papa John saw a 48.3% increase . Tapping on social media Bottle Rocket, a digital experience consultancy firm, conducted a consumer study with 500 participants, of which 47% of respondents indicated that they prefer to receive information about their favorite QSR through social media. QSRs focusing on social media have reaped the fruits of their labor with a significant rise in engagement and conversions. This is highlighted with Chick-fil-A driving the highest volume of paid media engagement last year, through their animated holiday film , 'Spark Home' and 'Light the Way'. Wendy's saw the greatest conversions with their ads promoting their 4 for $4 offer, which boasted the highest volume of engagements in the reporting period. Other examples of successful social media campaigns include Dunkin' collaboration with Discovery Channel to raise awareness for Shark Week - where the winning content entries were then highlighted on their digital billboard in Times Square. Domino's coupon campaign was well-received with over 8,000 shares and 20,000 entries. Improving Customer Experience With customers mostly relying on technology, and their inclination to contactless solutions, how then have QSRs leveraged this to improve the customer experience? Text ordering and marketing integration QSRs are building relationships and customer loyalty by changing the way they interact with their customers. Consistent communication is key, and the most effective way to do so is utilizing what customers use the most - their mobile devices. This allows QSRs to communicate with customers from the second they visit their mobile application, all the way to when the delivery driver drops the food off at their doorstep. Text messaging ordering makes it easier for customers to order and brings an added personal touch to the table. Geo-targeted messages can be sent, increasing the chances that customers will redeem offers sent to them, or save their previous orders for next time. Alerts could also be sent to inform customers that their orders are ready to be collected, or have arrived at their place. This simplifies their ordering process, and saves time, creating a seamless experience that translates to better customer satisfaction. Research by smscomparison has also shown that 75% of customers want offers to be sent to them via text message. These communication tools can be integrated into the QSR's mobile application. It is an opportunity to collect valuable customer insights, such as their preferences and orders, which can be used to generate future sales through better recommendations. Upgrading their mobile application There is a need to constantly review and improve your mobile application, to stay relevant to changing demands. It doesn't end after the application has been created. Dunkin' added a curbside service function to their mobile application at 1,400 locations to address the preference for such a service. White Castle, an Ohio-based burger chain, has also included a new loyalty program , dubbed \"Craver Nation\", to encourage application sign-ups through free meals and deals. Recruitment The previous sections went through how QSRs leveraged digitization to boost demand, but how have they utilized technology to change their hiring processes? Hiring remotely Although this concept existed pre-Covid-19, it is the norm now, as both applicants and interviewers have their guards up and hope to minimize physical interactions where possible. This gave rise to virtual interviews, where brands, such as A&W, can get interviewees to submit video resumes which reduces screening times and instances where both parties have to meet in light of safe-distancing measures. Only candidates who have passed through this initial round of screening will be scheduled for a final round which constitutes the physical interview. Additionally, mobile training materials make it easier for onboarding to happen online. Recruiters can now send handbooks, checklists, and even training videos via a text message link for all employees to access at their convenience. SMS reminders will also be sent to candidates, to guarantee completion. Handling large volumes of applicants Many QSRs are preparing themselves for a sharp increase in demand as the economy reopens, by running massive hiring campaigns. Papa John's and Chipotle are both pledging to increase their headcount by tens of thousands , to support their delivery and takeaway services. It is thus necessary to have recruitment tools made to handle large volumes of applicants. Envoy America hires up to 980 candidates in a year through a streamlined applicant dashboard, automated messaging, and customized screening process. With all applicants appearing within the same dashboard , recruiters were able to access applicants across different job boards. Automated scheduling also improved their reply rates as applicants are able to schedule their interviews based on pre-allocated slots in the recruiter's calendar. Reminders are also sent to applicants prior to the interview, with an option to reschedule if necessary, reducing ghosting. Finally, customized workflows allow the recruiter to set hiring parameters, thus saving time on screening as applicants will not make it through to the next round should they not fulfill any of the important criteria. To Wrap Up Now that you've seen how QSRs have embraced and adopted digitization to improve their processes in one way or another, have you decided how you'll incorporate these into your own QSR? It may seem overwhelming but the desire to take the first step is a great start. We're more than happy to provide personalized insights on how you can power up your QSR with tech trends.

Share this article Some fast-food restaurants start out small, pour gobs of money into expanding, and then fizzle out after only a few years. Does anyone remember Burger Chef , Clock Restaurant , and Chicken George ? But then there are some fast food businesses that lay a solid foundation of proven success and then thoughtfully promote, invest, and expand based on a thorough market analysis, rather than purely gut feelings. Five Guys Burgers and Fries is in the later category. The company continues to impress while expanding. Many fans of the franchise wonder who owns Five Guys , where did Five Guys start, and who is responsible for the tremendous amount of success the chain has seen. Five Guys is named after its five founders, all members of the Murrell family ( Jim , Matt , Chad , Ben , and then a two for one with the parents, Janie and Jerry), Five Guys has grown from a single location in 1986 in Alexandria, VA, to over 1,500 Five Guys locations worldwide as of 2018, and an additional 1,500 Five Guys locations under development. With Wendy's , McDonalds , and Burger Kings dominating the market, how did the Five Guys franchise grow from just a handful of stores in America to over 1500 worldwide? Where did 5 Guys start? The story of Five Guys appears to read like a Cinderella story at first, but as one probes into the company's history, the success of the company is revealed in the founder's obsessive attention to detail. When Jerry Murrell opened his first restaurant in Arlington Virginia in 1986 for about $70,000, the restaurant wasn't an immediate success. Murrell found that employees stole from the cashier register and his sons were always fighting over decision-making issues. But once each son found their niche in the company, based on their strengths, Five Guys began experiencing some success. To reach their current level though, the company owners began to take every aspect of the quality of the food and atmosphere very seriously. According to a 2012 Forbes article , employees were trained on the proper mix of starch, water and temperature needed to create the perfect french fry , which Murrell believes should be done by \"feel\" more than anything else—there are no timers in the restaurants. In the piece, Murrell said, \"Fries are much harder than burgers. We work day and night on them, all the damn time.\" That is probably why Five Guys is known for its made-to-order fresh beef burgers and its addicting hand-cut fries, which the company only uses peanut oil to prepare. The Murrell family (who owns Five Guys ) also tasted 16 different types of mayonnaise to find the right one for their burgers. And when the burger joint ’s purchasing manager suggested they switch to a frozen burger product, the family conducted a blind test and found that the burger cooked from fresh meat tasted better and stuck with that one. Five Guys also still uses the same bakery to produce the fresh hamburger buns that are used, even though they are pricier than, in order to create the best burger experience possible. From the outside Five Guys is a typical burger joing. But this fast casual restaurant is more than just a restaurant chain . It’s methodical and detailed in every aspect of the business. Expansion of Five Guys The decision to begin franchising Five Guys came in 2002 when the company already had expanded to five restaurants in northern Virginia . Though Murrell was initially against the idea, his sons eventually persuaded him by giving him the book, \"Franchising for Dummies,\" co-written by Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's . The Five Guys family met with former Washington Redskin 's kicker, Mark Mosley, who had a burger restaurant of his own and showed an interest in franchising. Moseley and the Murrells met with Fransmart , a franchise-development company and Mosley was eventually hired to be in charge of franchising, and lining up investors for the company's expansion into the company becoming a franchise business . Due to the popularity of the restaurant, the first Five Guys franchise opened in 2003 and the chain expanded from there, particularly along the East Coast. The company has also franchised outside US borders opening a store in the United Kingdom in July 2013. The chain now has 27 Five Guys locations open across the UK, with locations in the Middle East , Canada , and continues to expand in Europe. In March 2017, a location opened at Disneyland Paris' Disney Village, and in late 2017, Five Guys opened its first restaurants in Germany. Simple is Better Five Guys ' simplistic, but delicious food items created what some refer to as a cult-like following, despite the company's adherence to minimal advertising. Consumers have flocked to the American burger chain , and franchise opportunities are golden as franchisees can't seem to get stores open fast enough. Additionally, Five Guys continues to stomp the competition. A recent Business Insider story revealed that Five Guys once again claimed the top spot in the latest annual Harris Poll EquiTrend survey's \"Burger Brand of the Year\" category, defending its title against 17 other famous burger chains including Carl's Jr., Burger King , Jack in the Box, DQ, McDonald's , White Castle, Sonic, Wendy's , Whataburger, Shake Shack , and In-N-Out Burger . The interior of Five Guys locations are kept simple too featuring white tiling, checkered with five vertical rows of red tiles, each row representing one of the five sons of the chain's founder. The employee's uniforms are either plain red or white and red. Unlike many of the other fast food chains , there are only a few tables and chairs in Five Guys with potato sacks stacked in customer areas, giving a more wholesome, homely look to the restaurant. Five Guys restaurants also includes open kitchens enabling the customer to see their burgers being grilled to order and free, roast-shell peanuts for customers to eat while awaiting their order. Finally, rock music from the 60s and 70s are piped into the stores creating a nostalgic, but relaxing atmosphere. Five Guys doesn't rely on flashy, national ads to get people into their stores. The company's advertising philosophy is to let the food talk for the company. Jerry Murrell , one of the family members who owns Five Guys currently, told Inc. Magazine , \"We figure our best salesman is our customer. Treat that person right, he'll walk out the door and sell for you. From the beginning, I wanted people to know that we put all our money into the food. That's why the décor is so simple. We don't spend our money on décor. Or on guys in chicken suits. But we'll go overboard on food.\" Takeaways We learned about the family who own Five Guys and how they were conscious about every decision they made. It wasn’t the easiest ride but it took a group that was connected and a group able to endure any hard times facing them along the way. The lessons learned from following Five Guys ' successful rise includes: giving customers what they want, (good burgers, pricey-but-worth-it buns , delicious fries), fast, friendly service, all while keeping things simple, (ordinary decor, word-of-mouth advertising, etc.). No razzle-dazzle, no giant chickens in costumes, no playing with the menu and adding a fat free caramel moco-loco latte. Just good burgers and fries. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have good investors to get the expansion and franchise operations going, but that all came after establishing a solid, simple business model as the foundation.

The boat contained about 300 refugees who were trying to escape the Vietnam war. By a stroke of luck, Young's parents and older sister, who was less than 1 years old at that time, managed to immigrate to the United States. As the daughter of Chinese-Vietnamese refugees of war, Young was the first in her family to be born in the United States, and she grew up watching her parents work multiple jobs to make ends meet. In present time, from her office in the mission district of San Francisco, Young shared more about her journey. Her family roots and upbringing were very important to her, and imbued a strong sense of work ethics and determination. Young's mother was a hardworking business woman who gave her sound business advice, such as \"spend less than you make\", which served her well in her career. Today, Young is the co-founder and CEO of PlanGrid, a construction management software application company that operates like a Google Doc for blueprints. The company has secured more than $62 million in funding from groups including Sequoia, Founders Fund, 500 Startups, Box, Northgate, Spectrum 28, and Tenaya Capital. PlanGrid is utilized in more than 500,000 projects around the world, including Hudson Yards in NYC, Levi's Stadium, NVIDIA's new headquarters, the $150 million Highway 99 Realignment Project in Fresno, California, and many others. Young started her career as a construction engineer, after majoring in construction management at Sacramento State University, and was shocked by how inefficient the construction industry was. It was heavy, cumbersome and expensive, and version control of construction data was a huge problem. Young and her co-founders realized how difficult it was to physically ship paper out to field workers on construction job sites, and constantly update information. At that point in time, it became obvious to Young and her team that they needed to do something about it, and hence PlanGrid was born, in 2011. PlanGrid's software initially provided everyone with the ability to view blueprints on their iPad through a simple interface, that even the least tech-savvy workers could use. Today, clients use the software to share plans, markups, photos and reports with their entire project team. Users can even collaborate while offline, which is important as Wi-Fi signals at construction sites are often unreliable. Young has now built a successful business in the construction industry, and her team has no plans to slow down. Tens of thousands of contractors, owners, and architects use PlanGrid to finish their projects on time and within budget. Today, PlanGrid has over 300 employees based around the world, and customers in over 72 countries. There is plenty of room to grow in the United States, where paper is still used in the majority of today's construction projects; but there are also a lot of opportunities to expand globally. Her personal story speaks to aspiring entrepreneurs who are looking to start a company. As a female leader in two male-dominated industries, technology and construction, Young shared that she never felt a difference because of her gender. She believes that by being respectful, working hard, and building a great team, one can get the job done and deliver.

Share this article Morning trips with my family to McDonald's are one of the most vivid memories I have of my childhood. From gazing at the seemingly endless menu to persuading my parents to buy me a Happy Meal just for that free toy, McDonald’s became , in many ways, my happy place. Considering that they generate over $10 million in Happy Meal sales a day, it's safe to say that most millennials' childhoods were shaped by the iconic golden arches too. Beyond just Happy Meals , over 65 million people eat at McDonald's every day and they serve over 100 million burgers daily. From a humble restaurant with US$366.12 on its first day of business, McDonald’s now makes over US$20 billion in annual worldwide sales. But how exactly did they get to where they are today? How Did McDonald’s Gain Popularity How it All Started In 1954, Ray Kroc discovered a successful restaurant run by two brothers, Maurice \" Dick \" and Maurice \"Mac\" McDonald , while he was on a sales call in San Bernardino , California . Although it seemed like any other fast food restaurant of that time, their effective operation caught his eye. By specializing in a limited menu, they were able to focus on quality and quick service . They focused on burgers, fries, and shakes that sold at half the price and time of their competitors, with a self-service counter to avoid relying on waiters and waitresses. Each meal was prepared in advance and kept warm. All of these gave them a competitive edge against their competitors. Ray Kroc saw an opportunity to bring McDonald's across the United States, and this was where their collaboration began. Kroc was able to turn their business to the mass market with overwhelming success after buying the rights to franchise McDonald's restaurants across the country. Establishing a Business Model Kroc wanted to prioritize consistent high quality and uniform methods of preparation, where the food would taste the same no matter the outlet. He established a systematic approach where the operating system required franchisees to follow McDonald's core principles of quality, service, and value. This was when he founded McDonald's System, Inc in 1955. Evolution and Growth In 1955, Kroc opened his first franchised restaurant, then developed a financial model with Harry Sonneborn, that allowed McDonald's to own the land on which its franchisees built their restaurants. They sold their 100 millionth burger three years after that and rapidly grew to 67 restaurants in the fourth. Sonnenborn was named the first CEO of the company in 1959, before Kroc buying out the McDonald brothers for $2.6 million in 1961. McDonald's iconic golden arches and their mascot, Ronald McDonald, was introduced a year later. Kroc took the position of CEO, and McDonald's took its first step towards internationalization by opening a store in Canada. Another symbolic moment in their history was the opening of their store in Pushkin Square, Moscow, at the end of the Cold War. They opened their first McCafe from their attempt to go into coffee in Australia. The years that followed were of rapid growth, as they doubled their number of restaurants in 1996. They also opened more than 11,000 restaurants outside of the United States. McDonald’s Strategy By focusing on advertising, franchising, and constant innovations, McDonald's was able to develop a strategy with an effective business model. They targeted their advertisements by branding it as a fun place to go for families. Their mascot, Ronald McDonald, was also created to appeal to the younger demographics. Their franchising model has also helped them in achieving breakthroughs, as it allows their community to discover new business opportunities. The iconic Ronald McDonald and many of their popular menu items (such as Filet-O-Fish) were all first introduced through their franchisees! McDonald's was also able to stay ahead of the trends - such as the globalization trend in the 1970s, by franchising to local entrepreneurs and bringing McDonald's beyond America. Finally, McDonald's was able to adapt to emerging trends, including \"fast\" and \"convenient\" food as people had increasingly less time to spare, as well as the prioritization of health, where they came up with healthier options including salads, fruits, and carrot sticks. Similar to McDonald's who were able to establish a well-balanced business strategy, it is crucial that you are able to pinpoint which strategy works best for your business. For example, franchising is a good strategy if you're looking for growth and expansion, while innovation helps in helping your brand stay relevant, especially with rapidly changing consumer behaviors. Key to McDonald’s Success Today McDonald's did become one of the world's most profitable franchises overnight. They were able to incorporate several key success elements, which propelled the growth of the brand to what it is today. Consistency The development of a consistent menu and retail concept became one of McDonald's unique selling points, which invokes a sense of familiarity whenever one steps into their restaurants, no matter where they are in the world. Customers are aware of what to expect when considering places to dine at, be it in terms of food options or service, and McDonald's becomes a place where people are able to seek solace and comfort in, especially when they are in a foreign place. Ray Kroc also created the Hamburger University to serve this purpose - by training all franchises in the same way for uniformity, and also to ensure that they will run the restaurants as he envisioned. As a QSR business owner, think of how you can make your business consistent, be it in terms of products or experience. These will act as the unique selling point of your brand, which makes it recognizable and memorable in the eyes of the consumers, which will help in top of mind recall. Innovation While maintaining consistency, McDonald's is able to keep customers on their toes with constant product innovations. Franchisees were largely behind these innovations, through observations of customer trends and behaviors, and this is what led to the birth of many of McDonald's now-iconic menu items. From the Happy Meal to Big Mac and even McFlurry, these were all developed through franchisees to increase McDonald's range of product offerings. Localization is another key element in their pursuit of innovation. By producing limited-time or seasonal menu items catered to the tastes of the locals, they can motivate customers to return to their stores. Furthermore, this promises a unique experience which you can only get in a specific country, thus captivating the interests of tourists too. How exactly do they go about doing this? Did you know that the Steak & Egg burritos and BBQ Ranch Burgers are only available in America? In Japan, McDonald's serves Cheesecake McFlurries and Choco pies as permanent menu items! These are exclusive only to Japan and are made available in certain countries for a limited time only, increasing the demand for such products. When the Choco pies were introduced to Singapore as a seasonal menu item, they were sold out within three days, islandwide, highlighting their popularity. If you're looking into how to venture into innovation, observing trends and consumer behaviors can be an easy first step! Consider food trends that are increasingly popular, and find ways to assimilate them into your products, and they are bound to attract curious consumers! Embrace Technology McDonald's was one of the first quick-service chains to tap on technology to increase efficiency and convenience. From the development of self-service kiosks and digital menu boards to their current on a tech buying spree, McDonald’s has demonstrated a consistent commitment to staying ahead of the innovation curve. Many innovative McDonald’s franchisees have embraced the need for a new HR technology and have realized that people are the lifeblood of the franchise and it is imperative that McDonald’s uses technology to only employ the right people. McDonald’s owner-operator Alyssa Moten chose to reinvent her hiring process with Workstream . Through the power of text messaging, hiring automation, and teleconferencing, she is now able to source, screen, and onboard new hires in an entirely contactless fashion. This is especially paramount for franchisees looking to expand quickly - you’ll reap significant cost savings from having to rehire and retrain employees. Schedule your free personalized consultation with a hiring specialist today! Apart from hiring, McDonald’s largest acquisition is that of tech personalization company Dynamic Yield to create a customized drive-thru menu that can be tailored to things like the current weather, restaurant traffic, and trending items. Upon the start of the ordering process, the display also has the ability to recommend additional items based on your current selection. On a global scale, McDonald’s has also begun incorporating their first voice-initiated application process (Apply thru) in certain countries. By tapping on technological advancements, you too will be able to improve your business operations, reduce cost and automate processes, which makes it more convenient for both your staff and customers. Adapting in a Pandemic As a result of the recent global pandemic, McDonald's has to re-look into their current policies and make changes to adhere to governmental and safety guidelines. During the peak of the pandemic, they went the extra mile by donating 400,000 face masks to emergency operation centers as supplies were depleting in the U.S. Cash bonuses were also given out to every corporate-owned restaurant employee, equivalent to 10% of their pay. In light of the new store re-openings, they are implementing new cleaning regulations, using social distancing stickers, and mandating the use of personal protective equipment. Self-serve beverage bars will also be closed and protective panels have been installed at drive-thrus. All of their staff are required to don face masks, and gloves, if they are preparing food. To simplify operations, they have also reduced their menu offerings to their most popular items. At the same time, they will also be focusing their promotions on the affordability aspect in their new campaigns, due to customers' negative outlook on the economy. Through these new implementations, they have been able to maintain a positive brand perception among their customers, proving that they are taking the necessary precautions to make their McDonald's experience a safe one. The Future of McDonald’s Digital transformation is an ongoing trend across all industries, and it is no surprise that McDonald's is also embarking on this journey. A few years back, McDonald's invested $6 billion in their 'Experience of the Future' redesign, in hopes of modernizing most of their U.S. stores. Some of these improvements include the revamping of self-order kiosks, improving the readability of menu boards, and creating more parking spots for curbside pickups. In London, they have also launched a to-go location and unlike their usual outlets, it does not have in-store seats. Furthermore, the menu options have also been streamlined with only classic items, and all orders are made through kiosks. This allows the staff to focus on preparing the orders, maximizing the speed in which food is being delivered to each customer. The success of this store will then determine if more of such locations are rolled out in the future. They are also striving towards sustainability, by announcing plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030, alongside a 31% reduction in emissions intensity. The McCafe Sustainable Coffee journey is also another initiative created to increase awareness of sustainable sourcing. Should McDonald's be able to develop an omnichannel strategy, they might just be able to offset the reduced footfalls in their physical stores. Especially as consumer behavior shifts towards take-outs as opposed to dining in, their strategy towards revolutionizing their stores is all the more relevant now and will be worth keeping an eye on. Ultimately, McDonald's was started because Ray Kroc saw an opportunity. That's something McDonald's has stuck with throughout the duration of its existent. Constantly seizing opportunities and being proactive with their fast food chain. McDonald's success today is largely attributed to its franchising model, consistency, and innovation. Through their franchising model, they were able to enjoy rapid growth. This was then sustained by familiarity as their unique selling point, as the customer experience remains largely similar across their outlets worldwide. The innovation allowed them to continuously reach new targeted segments and keep customers coming back for more. As a QSR owner, franchising is an attractive option, especially if you have the goal of expanding your business exponentially. However, there is a need to conduct comprehensive research on consumer behaviors, segment the target markets, and determine positioning strategies. This will help in deciding whether or not these markets are profitable. Keep in mind that while franchising opens doors to many opportunities, it is also not going to be smooth-sailing all the time. That being said, consider how you can apply McDonald's key strategies to your own business but most importantly, find your unique selling point and maximize it!

Their chains are patronized by millions of customers daily in over 100 countries, making them one of the leading brands in the restaurant industry . Despite their massive number of followers, it is a known fact that the employees are, in fact, the most important customers of an organization. So, just how good and fair is McDonald's hourly rate, as compared to other giant companies like Walmart, Dunkin , and Chipotle ? What is the average McDonald's salary as well as the average hourly wage and starting pay? And most importantly, how satisfied are the employees with their wages? Let's dive into the nitty-gritty details of hourly wages in McDonald's and how it is affecting the company. McDonald's Starting Pay A typical McDonald's crew team member earns around US $12.86 per hour, which, truthfully speaking, is hardly enough to support an individual, let alone a family. They work five days a week, which is an average of 25-30 hours per week. In fact, we discovered that McDonald's actually limits the number of hours an employee can work to only 40 hours per week. For the longest time, McDonald’s restaurant starting salary was US $6.25 per hour. Fortunately, it went up when the minimum wage was increased, which is reasonable considering the laborious work they have to go through during their shifts. Moreover, they rarely get to choose the position they will be covering for that day as it is usually up to the general manager to decide on the task allocation. On the flip side, McDonald’s tends to hire people very readily which provides higher job opportunities for the workforce. Sometimes they may even give you a proposition to take up a managerial post for a 50 cents raise. However, with all the stress that comes from managing shifts, keeping track of employees’ timings and allocating job roles, the raise may just not be enough. Employees at McDonald’s usually get a 5 cents raise in 6 months. The largest increment is 25 cents but that is one uphill task to achieve. It also doesn’t help that there are no healthcare benefits to go with it. This will vary depending on the Mcdonald’s franchisee and the macroeconomic factors of the labor market . Fight for McDonald's Minimum Wage What is McDonald's minimum wage anyways? For over 7 years , McDonald’s employees have joined in the “ Fight for $15 ” movement to protest the unfair wage practices of fast-food chains . Dissatisfaction with the hourly wage was rampant amongst the employees and this brought much unwanted attention to McDonald's which inadvertently affected the business. It placed the company in a situation where they were forced to raise wages. But the question remained - by how much are they willing to do so? Since there may not be much room for progression while working at McDonald's , employees should arguably get the compensation that they deserve. Whilst maintaining profits and productivity is important for such giant corporations, the core of the company is still its employees. And as employers, it is only fair to not leave them in the lurch. But Is This True? Does McDonald's pay $15 an hour? The $15 minimum wage is equal to $30,000 a year for a full-time employee.  \"They're making millions while millions can't pay their bills\", says a hapless union group member, suggesting that there is plenty of profit left over in corporate suitcases to fund a massive pay increase . In actual fact, at least 90% of McDonald's locations are independently-owned by franchisees that are not making that kind of money (millions). They have approximately 6 cents profit from each dollar after paying for the food, staff costs, and other expenses. If you do a calculation and say the minimum wage is $15, then that wage will eat up three-quarters of the profit every year. And that is just the minimum wage . Most of the stores would not get any profit in doing so. And if it was so easy to just hike up the price of the meal in McDonald's , it would have already been done so. Unfortunately, customer backlash would then be par for the course when it comes to such price increases. In other parts of the world, self-service checkout kiosks are commonplace. They have been a norm in many European countries for over seven years now and have been tested successfully in certain parts of the US as well. If self-service counters were to replace entry-level employees, and the minimum wage goes up, then there will be much fewer people employed by McDonald's . And that, in turn, will result in lower employment opportunities for young adults in the country. Undeniably, you can't really satisfy everyone. It is hard to say whether the organizers behind the $15 minimum wage campaign are really supporting hourly workers or are doing so for their own purposes, and wallets. Evidently, much more thought needs to go into the consequences of having such a minimum wage . So, does McDonald’s pay $15 an hour? Well, it depends. McDonald's , as a global fast-food chain with substantial revenue, certainly has the financial capacity to afford paying its employees $15 an hour. However, the feasibility of implementing a $15 per hour minimum wage for all employees may vary based on factors such as local minimum wage laws, the cost of living, and the competitive landscape in each region. California McDonalds may have more opportunity to pay their employees a higher wage than, let’s say, Florida . At the end of the day it comes down to revenue and profit margin. What is the highest paying position McDonald's ? The individuals who typically earn the highest pay at McDonald's are generally general managers, assistant managers, supervisors, and employees in specialized roles. Restaurant managers, for instance, are responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the restaurant and are among the top earners. Additionally, shift managers , who assist in managing shifts and employees, also tend to earn more than entry-level crew members . Furthermore, roles that require specialized skills or experience, such as maintenance technicians or corporate trainers, can command higher pay rates. However, it's crucial to remember that pay can vary by location, experience, and specific job responsibilities. What Other Companies Are Doing Perhaps something can be learned from Walmart’s recent move with their college tuition scheme - they are giving their employees a push to evolve and gradually improve their skills. Needless to say, that is a smart move to boost the morale of their employees. Similarly, Disney has also offered full college tuition for their workers, which is something really remarkable and inspiring for employers to note. If you, as an employer, give support to your workers, they will be more satisfied and willing to work harder. Even if they are not entirely satisfied with their hourly wages . As an added bonus, you get all the good publicity that comes with it. Can’t hurt to try, right? The Mcdonald’s corporation has come a long way in terms of pay for their fast-food workers . Free meals and half-hearted perks don’t fly anymore so as long as Mcdonald’s corporate and the franchisees work together, the best it yet to come.

Share this article McDonald’s and KFC are two of the largest fast food chains in the world, with thousands of outlets internationally. Thanks to their quick services and iconic menus full of cheeseburgers , fries, nuggets and fried chicken, they were able to grow into fast food leaders across the globe for many years now. What could be attributed to their impeccable success and why have franchisees of these brands stuck around for so long? Large organizations such as these undeniably need thousands of crew members to help them operate flawlessly on a daily basis and deliver what they promise to their customers. So, it goes without saying that employees are one of the important factors which contributes to a company’s success. For McDonald’s and KFC , there is a need for a variety of employees, considering the dynamic nature of the industry. Thus, just as much as they have full-time employees, their hourly workers also make up a substantial portion of their workforce and are an essential part of their operations. Undoubtedly, it's probably more challenging to maintain a stable base of hourly employees than full-time employees since they are usually individuals who come and go. So how do McDonald’s and KFC achieve this and which one of them fare better at retaining their hourly workers? Let’s unpack what each of them has to offer and find out! KFC Bonus Vouchers Bonuses for hourly employees? Yup, that’s what KFC is doing on a quarterly basis. Here, when an employee works hard and clocks in a lot of hours, they are entitled for retail vouchers which can go up to $250 dollars for a single employee. This not only motivates them to work harder but also boosts their morale which encourages them to stay longer in the company. Moreover, instead of rewarding employees with cold, hard cash, these vouchers give staff members a feeling of connection to the company, inducing a sense of belonging despite the nature of their position. Free Food Most of the hourly workers in KFC work as cashiers, cooks or front-end team members . This means that most, if not all, of their working hours are spent on-site. Needless to say, these employees are surrounded by the food items that they serve most of the time, while being consistently on their feet no less! As such, the management has decided to provide them with free meals , which are regulated differently from country to country. For some areas, employees are given the option to take away any food that is not sold during work hours at the end of the day. The free employee meals are a benefit is appreciated by many employees since their job can get exhausting especially during peak periods. In fact, most employees like that they can get their meals for free in their workplace during their shift, probably because of its convenience. Employee Discounts One of the things that employees love when working at KFC is being eligible for discounts on anything in the menu during non-working hours. Depending on the duration they have been working for in the company, their position, and their performance at work, they can get employee discounts from a minimum of 10% to 30% on all items. This means that hourly employees can, not only eat free meals at work, but also have the benefit of treating themselves and their loved ones at an exclusive price when they are not working! REACH Educational Grant Program The REACH Educational Grant Program is a scheme which helps KFC ’s employees pursue their college education, and yes, this includes hourly employees as well. Under this program, selected staff are entitled to receive a sum of money to subsidize their tuition fees. To receive this grant, however, there are a few criteria in which they have to fulfil - amongst others, employees have to be with the company for a minimum of 6 months before they are eligible for it. The subsidized amount ranges from $2000 to $2500 for all non-managerial staff. And, of course, these workers have to be current or prospective students of accredited colleges before being recipients of this grant. This may arguably be the best benefit KFC has to offer which aids in retaining their hourly employees. After all, who will refuse financial aid for the most expensive stage of their education? McDonald's One Free Meal Per Shift Have you ever craved a big mac and a small fry ? Maybe a Mcmuffin or a happy meal ? Similar to KFC , hourly employees at McDonald’s who decide to do a full shift are eligible for 1 full meal. To make things better, they have the freedom to choose what they want for their meal (except for menu items from McCafe). Undoubtedly, this motivates employees to stay longer so that they are able to redeem their free meal for the day. 50% Discount on Two Meals Aside from the free meals , McDonald’s employees are also eligible for a 50% discount on two meals when they purchase items from the food menu. They can enjoy this discount once a day when they are buying meals for two people (or one) and it's a great way to help them save up money on food, no matter how much they've worked that day, or even on their non-working day! Higher Minimal Pay Per Hour than the Rest Both KFC and McDonald’s are obligated to pay at least a minimum wage per hour for all their employees, including hourly workers. In 2015, McDonald’s decided to pay their workers a dollar higher than the minimum wage in all countries. Needless to say, the employees here have a guaranteed higher minimum pay than anywhere else and naturally, employees feel more appreciated. This gives them a reason to stay on in the company for a longer period, which contributes to McDonald’s ability in retaining their hourly employees. Archways to Opportunity Just like KFC , McDonald’s places a high importance on the personal growth of its employees. Thus, they created Archways to Opportunity , a comprehensive education strategy which gives their workers a chance to further their studies. As with the REACH program by KFC , McDonald’s subsidizes a portion of their employees’ tuition fees to ease their financial burden. Not only that, eligible employees are also able to extend this benefit to immediate family members should they want to get a high school diploma. For hourly employees, they merely have to work for 90 cumulative days, work an average of 15 hours per week or more, and maintain a performance rating of “significant performance” or better throughout the program in order to be eligible for the subsidy. If there is one thing that’s commendable about these programs, it is definitely the fact that these benefits are not solely for full-time employees, but also for their part-time staff as well. This prevents their hourly staff from feeling discriminated against even when they work just as hard as the permanent staff in the company. Both KFC and McDonald’s offer their own sets of employee perks and benefits. By having strong retention programs and onboarding strategies, it allows them to have a stable base of hourly workers. The question still remains - which one is better than the other? Ultimately, it is about individual preferences and which benefit one prioritizes. So, we leave it up for you to decide - if you were an hourly worker, which fast food chain would you choose? For more news and updates on the latest trends, subscribe to our blog.

It allows them to manage the recruitment process more efficiently and effectively. In this guide, we’ll provide a comprehensive overview of what an ATS is and how it can be used to streamline the hiring process. We’ll also discuss some of the key features you should look for when choosing an ATS. So, if you’re looking to improve your recruitment process, read on! What is an applicant tracking system? An applicant tracking system is an application that helps businesses manage the recruitment process. It’s designed to streamline how companies collect, sort, and track job applications. An ATS can be used to track all aspects of the recruitment process, from initial job postings to final applicant selections. How do applicant tracking systems work? There is no singular ATS that all businesses use. Applicant tracking systems work in different ways depending on the specific software. However, most applicant tracking systems share some common features and functions. These common features include: Data storage Perhaps the most foundational function of an ATS is the storage of applicant information. ATS software is designed to collect and organize applicant data. This data can include everything from contact information, work history, resumes, and cover letters. Applicant tracking systems typically allow employers to search this data using keywords or other criteria. This makes it easier to find qualified applicants when needed. Screening Being able to screen potential applicants effectively is vital when handling large numbers of applications, which means it's important that your applicant tracking system has robust screening capabilities . These features should include: Smart-screening questions Smart-screening questions are mandatory questions within your application that enable you to automatically reject unqualified applicants. Eligibility parameters Eligibility parameters help you identify applicants who meet the minimum requirements for the position, such as \"years of experience\" or \"education level.\" Skill testing Some applicant tracking systems have built-in tests that allow you to assess an applicant’s skills and abilities. These can be helpful for positions that require specific technical skills. Resume-ranking functionality Another vital function that you can expect from your ATS is the ability to rank resumes. Applicants who have applied for a job through an ATS will have their resumes automatically stored in the system. This software will then use predetermined criteria to rank each resume. This criteria can be based on how well the resume stacks up to the job description and requirements. The ATS will also consider things like the applicant's work experience, education, and skills. By ranking resumes, the ATS can help you quickly identify the most qualified applicants for a job. This is a huge time saver as you no longer have to review each and every resume that comes in manually. Reporting Any decent ATS software should provide you with some basic reporting functionality . This includes things like the ability to track how many resumes have been received, how many candidates have been contacted, and how many interviews have been scheduled. This information can be extremely valuable, as it can help you gauge the effectiveness of your recruiting efforts. For example, if you're not receiving many qualified resumes, you may need to adjust your job postings. Or, if you're finding that most applicants are rejected after the first interview, you may want to reconsider your interviewing process. Automation Finally, you can expect your ATS to automate some of the more tedious and time-consuming aspects of recruiting. This can include everything from posting job openings on your website to sending automatic email responses to applicants. By automating these tasks, your ATS can save you a considerable amount of time and effort. This allows you to focus on more important things, like meeting with applicants and making hiring decisions. What are the benefits of using an ATS? Employers and recruiters have been utilizing ATS for years. The best applicant tracking systems have several key benefits: Time-saving Perhaps the main advantage of using an ATS is that it can save you a considerable amount of time and effort. By automating repetitive tasks, an ATS can free up your time so you can focus on more important things like meeting with applicants and making hiring decisions. Improved organization Another benefit of using an ATS is that it can help you better organize your recruitment process. An ATS can store all your applicant information in one centralized location, which makes it easy to keep track of things. Additionally, an ATS can automate things like job postings and email responses, which can help improve how you organize your hiring efforts. Higher quality hires Because an ATS can rank resumes and track applicant information, it can help you identify the best candidates for a job. This, in turn, can lead to higher-quality hires. Increased applicant engagement Finding great applicants isn't worth much if you can't get them to apply for your open positions. However, an ATS can help with this by automatically posting your job openings to multiple job boards and websites. This helps increase the visibility of your open positions and, as a result, can lead to increased applicant engagement. Keep up with the competition An applicant tracking system is almost mandatory if you want to keep up with the competition. This is because more and more employers are using an ATS to streamline their recruitment process. Failure to use an ATS will mean you'll likely be at a disadvantage when competing for top talent, and it can close you off from great hiring opportunities. Improved efficiency One of the main goals of using an applicant tracking system is to improve the efficiency of your recruitment process. An ATS can help you achieve this by automating repetitive tasks and storing applicant information in one centralized location. This makes it easy to find the information you need when you need it, which can save you a lot of time and effort. Reduced costs Finally, you can expect to see a reduction in costs when using an applicant tracking system. As you improve efficiency and cut out much of the unnecessary busy work, you free up time and money that can be spent on more important things like training your staff. What are the features of an ATS? When it comes to applicant tracking systems, there is a wide range of features you can expect , including: Resume screening A feature you can expect with just about any ATS is the ability to screen resumes. This will allow you to filter out resumes that don't match the criteria you need. This filter may be done based on the job description or other screening factors like smart-screening questions . Why this matters: When advertising a role, it's very possible to receive dozens, if not hundreds, of applications. Going through each application manually would be hugely time-consuming. Applicant tracking systems give you the ability to screen resumes quickly and easily. Removing applications that aren't a good match right away means you can focus your time on the most qualified applicants. Keywords A keyword feature allows you to parse through resumes and identify which ones contain the keywords you're looking for. These features also allow you to use negative keywords to avoid looking at resumes that include a keyword you aren't interested in. Why this matters: Many applicant tracking systems now use some form of artificial intelligence (AI) to help screen resumes. However, these systems are still only as good as the keywords you input. This means that it's still important for you to carefully consider the keywords you're using. You'll want to use both positive and negative keywords to make sure you're getting the most accurate results possible. Filters A filtering feature lets you narrow down the pool of applicants by specifying certain criteria. For example, you may want to only look at applicants who can work and live within a certain radius of the job location. Why this matters: The filtering feature is one of the most powerful features offered by applicant tracking systems. It's great for categorizing types of applications, as well as finding the very best match for a job opening. Automated emails One feature that applicant tracking systems offer is the ability to automate email communications. This means you can set up automatic responses after you receive a resume, when an applicant moves to the next stage of the process, and so on. Why this matters: Automated email communications can help keep your applicants updated on the status of their applications as well as the next steps they should expect. This can be a great way to improve communication and keep your applicants informed throughout the process. Advanced analytics Some applicant tracking systems also offer advanced analytics features . This can include things like being able to see what sources your best applicants are coming from or predicting how long it will take to fill a role. Why this matters: Advanced analytics can be a helpful way to get insights into your recruiting process. This information can be used to improve your process as well as make more informed decisions about your hiring. CRM software Many applicant tracking systems have CRM (customer relationship management) software built in. This allows you to engage your potential applicants directly via the system rather than needing to rely on external tools like email. Why this matters: CRM software can be a great way to keep track of your potential applicants and engage with them directly. This can help you build relationships, keep your applicants interested in the role, and ensure communication lines never fall through the cracks. The last thing you want is to miss out on a great applicant because you forgot to respond to an email. Applicant pool sourcing An applicant pool sourcing feature allows you to retain information and data from potential candidates even if they don't get offered the role for which they originally applied. This allows you to grow your applicant pool and contact individuals for future roles that may be a better match. Why this matters: Not every good applicant will get the job. But that doesn’t mean you can’t hire them later for a different role. Applicant sourcing features allow you to build a pool of potentially great candidates who may be perfect for an upcoming position. These tools are also built with compliance in mind since data storage is a sensitive issue. Integrations The best ATS should be able to integrate with your existing HR software. This allows you to have all your applicant data in one place and makes it easy to keep track of. Why this matters: Having a system that can integrate with your other HR software is important for keeping all of your applicant data in one place. This can make it easier to keep track of and ensure that you're not duplicating data entry. Onboarding Finally, many applicant tracking systems offer an onboarding feature. This means you can use the system to help new hires get acclimated to their new role and company. This can include things like collecting new hire paperwork, setting up training programs, or sending out welcome emails. Why this matters: Onboarding is an important part of the recruiting process and can help ensure new hires are successful in their roles. Having a system that can help with this can be a great way to improve your onboarding process. Drawbacks of using an ATS While ATS software is a fantastic tool to help recruiters and employers bring in talent, there are a few potential drawbacks to using applicant tracking systems. Cost The cost of the software, as well as the subscription fees, can add up quickly. Additionally, applicant tracking systems can require a significant time and resource investment to set up and maintain. Complexity Applicant tracking systems can be complex and require a certain level of technical expertise to set up and use. This can make it difficult for small businesses and startups to get started using applicant tracking systems. Inaccurate results Algorithms are not perfect. When your applicant tracking system uses a less reliable algorithm to select applicants, you may mistake a well-qualified candidate for a less qualified one. This can lead to good applicants slipping through the cracks and a potentially bad candidate experience . Lack of human touch Because ATS programs are automated, they lack the human touch that is so important in the hiring process. This can lead to a feeling of disconnection between applicants and employers. This could also lead applicants to feel disconnected from your business. Similarly, you may end up with an applicant who is good on paper but clashes with the ethos and culture of your company. ATSs are becoming more and more commonplace in the recruiting landscape. However, it's important to be aware of the potential drawbacks of using applicant tracking systems before deciding whether to use one or not. How accurate are applicant tracking systems? As it stands, ATSs are very accurate when you account for just how much data they work through. They can help narrow down an applicant pool to a manageable list of qualified candidates in a relatively short amount of time. However, there are a couple of caveats. Firstly, they struggle to differentiate between similar candidates. This is because ATSs are automated systems that rely on algorithms to sort and select candidates. These algorithms are not perfect and can sometimes make mistakes. This can lead to good applicants being overlooked or even rejected outright. Secondly, ATSs are not human and cannot replace the personal touch that is so important in recruiting. They can help narrow down an applicant pool and save time, but they should not be used as a replacement for human interaction. They cannot interview applicants, nor can they assess competence or character. Finally, the results you get are only as good as the data you input. This means that applicant tracking systems can only be as accurate as the information you give them. If there are errors in your data, the applicant tracking system will make errors in its assessment. For these reasons, it's important to use applicant tracking systems as one part of your recruiting process. They can be valuable tools, but they should not be the only tool you use. Applicant tracking systems should be used in conjunction with other methods, such as personal networking, referrals, and job boards. How to ensure success when implementing an ATS As it should now be clear, there are enormous benefits to using applicant tracking systems as long as you set yourself up for success. Recognize why you need an ATS What is the exact problem you need to solve? Success will come when the applicant tracking system complements your current recruitment strategy. Trying to fix what isn't broken will only lead to frustration. Get buy-in from all stakeholders An applicant tracking system can only be as successful as the people using it. This means that you'll need to get buy-in from everyone who will be using the system. This includes managers, recruiters, and even the IT team. Have a plan for data migration An applicant tracking system will only be as good as the data you put into it. This means you'll need to have a plan for migrating your data into the system. This can be a time-consuming process, but it's essential for success. Summary Incorporating an applicant tracking system can be the difference between a successful hiring process and a frustrating one. It can save you time and money while also improving the quality of your hires.

And, even as social distancing measures become more relaxed, customer data shows the preference for things like drive-thru and delivery is here to stay. So, if you're a restaurant owner looking to offer your customers more off-premise dining options, you're in luck. We’re going to help you take advantage of this increasingly popular trend by discussing: 7 of the most common off-premise dining options Tips on how to make them work for your business The pros and cons of off-premise vs. on-premise dining What is off-premise dining? Off-premise dining refers to any dining experience that happens outside of your restaurant. In other words, your customers purchase food from your restaurant but consume it elsewhere. Of course, this is nothing new. Off-premise dining has always been popular among restaurant-goers. But the COVID-19 pandemic has forced restaurant owners to put more effort into their off-premise dining services to adjust to the new normal. How to upgrade your restaurant’s off-premise dining options Let’s now take a look at seven of the most popular options for off-premise dining and discuss ways you can add or upgrade this service for your restaurant. Food delivery In recent years, there has been a surge in the food delivery market thanks to the emergence of third-party delivery services, like GrubHub and UberEats. The COVID-19 pandemic has also made this off-premise dining option more popular due to safety concerns involved with dining out. If you are currently using third-party delivery services, consider setting up your own in-house delivery system to have more control over the whole delivery process. By doing so, you can save money on delivery service fees that range from 10-30%. Takeout Throughout the pandemic, takeout has also increased in popularity among customers. According to The National Restaurant Association’s 2021 State of the Restaurant Industry Report , 53% of adults say purchasing takeout or delivery food is now essential to the way they live. To upgrade your customers' takeout experience, set up a curbside station that is visible to customers as they arrive at your restaurant. Consider also creating separate sections for in-person ordering and pick up so both can run simultaneously without disruption. Drive-thru You used to only find drive-thrus at fast-food restaurants. But this business model has been widely adopted by other fast-casual restaurants due to increased demand during the pandemic. One consumer survey found that, in August 2021, 52% of orders in quick-service restaurants were placed in drive-thrus. Increasing your service speed is crucial to improving your customers’ drive-thru experience. One way to accomplish this is to let customers pre-order food online through your restaurant’s app. You could also create a drive-thru only menu that only consists of food and drink items that your staff can prepare quickly. Ghost kitchens Ghost kitchens are restaurants that operate entirely out of a kitchen and only prepare food for delivery or takeout. The market size of ghost kitchens was estimated at more than $43.1 billion in 2019. And that number is expected to grow to $71.4 billion by 2027! You can experiment with the ghost kitchen business model by separating a part of your kitchen to only serve and prepare online orders. You can also adapt your current menu into a delivery-friendly version and set up a new brand on a third-party service to reach a different market. Drive-in restaurant A drive-in restaurant is a restaurant that has a parking area where customers can order and dine inside their vehicles. Some popular chains in the United States like Sonic and A&W are the pioneers of this type of off-dining experience. And Sonic managed to increase sales by $1 billion in 2020! To start a drive-in service, begin by creating a specialized menu of foods that are easy to consume in the car. On top of that, make it easy for customers to order through your online website, by phone or on your restaurant app. Mobile Kitchen Mobile kitchens come in different forms: food trucks, food trailers or food carts. The main benefits of mobile kitchens are flexibility and mobility. There’s also an opportunity to profit big from this business model. In 2020, the food truck market size was valued at more than $1.2 billion ! To run a mobile kitchen like a food truck, make sure you apply for required permits, such as a mobile food facility permit and a parking permit. These permits are, of course, on top of your restaurant license. Make sure to also do some research about where to best station your mobile kitchen and what type of foods customers prefer from this restaurant model. Meal kit subscription service Adding a meal subscription service to your restaurant’s offerings can give customers a new and exciting way to order from your restaurant. And, while it’s true this won’t appeal to all of your customers, the projected market size does show it’s appealing to enough of them. In 2022, the global meal kit service market size is expected to surpass $13 billion . To test demand for this service, experiment with a variety of subscription offerings. For example, you could offer full meal kits for your restaurant’s signature offerings, including basic ingredients and step-by-step instructions. Similarly, you could sell customers pre-made frozen meals of your most popular menu items. On-premise vs. off-premise dining pros and cons Your restaurant may offer customers the option to choose between on-premise and off-premise dining. But if you’re deciding whether to invest more time and resources into one of these dining options to adapt to the ongoing pandemic, it’s important to know the pros and cons of each. Pros of on-premise dining More menu options. At your restaurant, you can offer customers a wider variety of dishes. That’s because, when customers dine in, you don’t have to worry about things like meals getting cold while getting delivered or how well your food containers can contain certain ingredients. Upselling opportunities. It’s easier to upsell things like appetizers and drinks when you get to speak directly to your customers. And, as you know, upsells can significantly increase your profit margin on a single check. Customer experience. When you can have in-person interaction with customers, you’re also more likely to build customer loyalty that can turn first-time customers into repeat customers. Cons of on-premise dining Operating costs. Having an on-premise dining area means you have to pay for enough space to give customers a comfortable dining experience. This, of course, adds more to your restaurant’s overhead costs. Labor costs. Your restaurant needs staff like hosts, servers and cashiers for on-premise dining. This, too, adds to your overall operating expenses. Health concerns. Due to the ongoing pandemic, your customers still might not feel comfortable dining in at your restaurant. Pros of off-premise dining Low operational cost. Thanks to automation and outsourcing, off-premise dining options can be inexpensive to run. Higher profit. Due to lower operational costs, you can earn a higher return on investment than you would running a traditional brick-and-mortar restaurant. Better customer reach. Things like ghost kitchens can help expose your restaurant to new customers that might not have ever visited your restaurant but would like to try out your food. Cons of off-premise dining Menu limitation. Certain meals are best served fresh and not suitable for delivery, resulting in limited menu offerings for off-premise services. Lack of control. If you partner with third-party delivery services, you have little to no control over things like customer wait time and the overall quality of the delivery service. Difficult to build customer loyalty. Since your customers have very little direct interaction with your restaurant, it’s harder to stand out among competitors and retain long-term customers. Final thoughts More and more people are choosing to avoid eating in restaurants due to lingering health concerns related to COVID-19. And, as a restaurant owner, you’ll want to upgrade your restaurant’s off-premise dining options to keep up with the competition. We hope this article has given you some ideas to make it happen!

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter 02/17/22 How to become an HR pro while in QSR Ops Share this article QSR operations requires fractured thinking. One moment, you are handling ordering for the restaurant, and the next moment you are handling employee discipline. You have to familiarize yourself with a lot of concepts and wear many hats. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to become great at HR when your time is spent in many different business areas. Today, we will break down seven simple things you can do to learn HR skills (even when you're in operations!) 1. Implement human resources best practices One of the first things you can do to become an HR pro is implementing human resources best practices. HR is constantly changing, but a few ideas have stood out that make businesses better: Having annual reviews to keep employees up to date on their progress and the skills they need to succeed. Using rubrics to hire the best employees so that you can avoid potential bias at work. Conducting quarterly employee satisfaction surveys so you can keep track of employee burnout or dissatisfaction. Performing compensation and benefits reviews consistently, so you are keeping in line with the competition in your area. Reviewing and updating employee manuals regularly to ensure your employees have the latest copy of your rules. 2. Create standard operating procedures for HR If you’ve been in operations for a while, you probably have created checklists for almost every aspect of your store. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) help you manage the restaurant and delegate tasks when you can’t be present. Besides delegation, SOPs help you build confidence in your work in HR. Writing down all the steps you need to take for tasks like writing a job description or doing an annual review will save you a ton of time, especially if you don’t do a task often. It can be deflating to return to a task only to realize you forgot how to do something. Create a list of all the HR tasks you do, and start putting together documents of the steps you take the next time you have to do it. You’ll be surprised how much time you save by taking these simple steps. 3. Become a forward thinker Human resources requires forward-thinking. Employees in the QSR industry are leaving or moving on to new restaurants rapidly. To keep talented employees, you have to see the bigger picture and set up a restaurant that can retain employees and grow year after year . Take your time to work on your business and be proactive instead of reacting to things as they come to you. The best HR pros are thinking about what they can do to sustain and grow in 2022 and beyond. 4. Get an HR certification If you are not fully educated in human resources, you can study and become HR certified. There are many certifications you can get from SHRM and HRCI . You can take these tests even if you don’t have a college or post-graduate degree in HR. Taking these certifications is a time-consumptive process, but studying helps you understand more about HR processes. Your company’s headquarters or franchise owners might help you with the process of being certified since getting one would help them too. If you are interested in learning more about human resources, it’s crucial to have a conversation with your organization's leaders. Let them know that you want to take a more active role in your company’s HR decisions. From there, you can pick the best certification for your knowledge level and create a study schedule or take classes to help you pass the test. 5. Learn alongside other HR professionals Before getting certified, you can still connect and learn from other HR professionals. Taking what you learn and translating it into your own organization will help you bring fresh ideas to work. Here are a few ways to learn with other HR pros: Connect with other operations professionals at area businesses to learn more about how they deal with HR. Find a local chapter of SHRM to join and attend meetings. Use LinkedIn and other networks to find and chat with HR professionals in the field. Read blogs (like the Workstream blog) to learn more tips for the HR industry. 6. Track and use HR metrics If you want to build your HR skills, try tracking and using HR metrics . It’s essential to get a pulse on your restaurant's cost per hire or retention rates. The easiest way to do that is to understand what goes into these metrics so you can track where things are and make decisions based on data. Reporting these metrics to your managers and acting on the insights you get will help you be seen as an authority at work. By taking 30 minutes each week to keep track of your company, you can save the organization money and step up your status as an HR professional. 7. Hire an HR consultant Last, if your company needs help with HR, hire an HR consultant. Working with a consultant can give you all the information you need to know: Where your company is. How to make it better. How to maintain that status once the consultant leaves. HR consultants are not cheap, but spending a week with someone who understands HR and how to make your life easier is worth the money. Before you hire a consultant, think about the areas of your business you want to focus on. For example, you might want help with hiring, firing, retention, benefits or any number of items. Find a consultant who can help you address these issues and take ample notes while they are at your restaurant. With the help of one consultant, you can transform the way HR works at your restaurant. Take your time to become an HR pro Becoming better at human resources takes a lot of dedication. By using the seven strategies covered in this article, you should be able to go from operations to HR (or just beef up your HR process) without stressing out. Human resources is an essential function of running a business. The best QSR operations managers understand the value of implementing HR best practices and thinking ahead. Now, it’s time to make sure that everyone is on the same page about you stepping up and leading your team to a solid HR strategy.

Share this article The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a Federal tax credit that aims to encourage employers to hire people who have traditionally faced a lot of difficulties when looking for a job . This includes people who are on unemployment, food stamp recipients, veterans, and ex-felons—to name a few. Employers can claim up to $9,600 in tax credits for each hire who qualifies. In this webinar, Lydia Hall, Head of Growth at Workstream, answers the question \"What is WOTC?\" She'll take you on a deep dive into the process of identifying people who qualify as soon as they apply, how to claim the benefits, and how the tax law has changed in 2020. Read on for the full webinar transcript: Hello and welcome to Workstream's weekly webinar. This week we are focused on answering the question \"What is WOTC?\" You'll learn how you as an employer can claim up to $9,600 in credits for every new hire. That sounds like a lot right and one of the best things about this is you can apply it to any year that you owe taxes, this year or any year in the next 20 years. So let's dig in a little bit more about what is WOTC. So it's a Federal tax credit available to employers for hiring individuals from targeted groups who have consistently faced significant barriers to employment. And you know, when you think about what those groups are, some of it has to do with where they live, what other circumstances they've been dealing with, and areas where there are low employment rates . So we'll dig in a little bit more about this. If you try to file for WOTC tax credits and you just do the automatic WOTC form filing when you have a new hire, you'll see the average by industry you could be getting.  So without any additional work on your end in terms of trying to like find those people, if you're hiring hourly workers in the construction, food and beverage, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing or retail, this is the average amount that you will get for 100 hires that you make in tax credits just by having them fill out an 8850 form and pushing that information through to the IRS. There's a little bit more that they require on the back end, we'll get to that. Thankfully we also make it so you can just automate that part. So who qualifies for the WOTC? How to Qualify for the WOTC There are a few different groups, one of the biggest misconceptions about WOTC is that it's all about hiring ex-cons and this is actually the smallest group of people who people claim benefits for, or rather claim tax credits for. The number one are hiring people who receive food stamps . They're called SNAP Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Now eight to ten percent of Americans are on these food stamp benefits. You can hire somebody who's not on food stamp benefits but someone else in their family is receiving SNAP and you can get a max tax credit of $2,400 per year just because somebody qualifies under these rules. Similarly welfare is the other use the second biggest it's a long term TANF Temporary Assistance for Needy Families . So if there's somebody who's receiving welfare either who you hire or they have someone in their family who is on this benefit , you can similarly get the tax credits up to $9000 in tax credits you know for hiring a person who qualifies there. Designated Community Resident . Now this is the most vague and underutilized area but it covers the biggest population of the United States. So Empowerment Zones, if somebody lives in one of these zones and they're between the ages of 18 and 39 , they will qualify you as an employer to be able to claim tax credits and then if they l ive in a rural area that is somewhere that is far away from a lot of employment opportunities , they similarly will qualify you as an employer to claim tax credits for hiring them and you can see there are a lot of rural counties. Keeps going on and on and on and if you want the full list there is a WOTC guide on workstream.us under ebooks and you can see the full list there we have it updated for 2020. So a Designated Community Resident they really just need to live within those zones and be between the ages of 18 and 39. Going back the Supplemental Security Income , this is generally for people who are over the age of 65 or if they are blind or they are disabled so if you hire somebody who's over 65, chances are you could be getting another $2400 in tax credits . Unemployment Benefits . This is one of the best things to take advantage of right now, because we have a ridiculously high unemployment rate in the U.S. with everything going on in the world. If you hire somebody who has been on u nemployment benefits for 27 consecutive weeks so six months basically and they've received it , you as an employer by helping them get off of unemployment benefits and giving them a job can receive $2400 in tax credits . Veterans , if you hire a veteran there are lots of ways this is the biggest tax credit you get $9600 in tax credits , which is you know even more than hiring somebody who is on welfare or has somebody else in their family who is on welfare. Veteran you just need to make sure that they have been out for at least two months , that they fit one of the criteria listed below so they don't need to fit all four of those but it's somebody who is a veteran and either has somebody who received food stamps which again is eight to ten percent of the U.S. population, somebody who has a disability , somebody who has been unemployed for at least one month which again is very common right now or there's an aggregate period of unemployment at least six months during the prior year . Ex-felon . This is a group which people misconstrue as being what the WOTC is about, an ex-felon qualifies you for $2,400 in tax credits . It has to be within one year that they were released from prison or one year from when they were convicted so it's a very small window and very few people take advantage of this. I would suggest if you do add screening questions to see whether or not people who are applying to your job might qualify you for this tax credit, separate out the ex-felon question and the veteran question from the other like food stamps, welfare resident questions because generally when people see ex-felon they are like 20% less likely to fill out the form to see that they qualify because they think that this is something that's negative versus something that actually helps them get hired. Vocational Rehab Referral is a person with a mental or physical disability who's receiving services. There are organizations in your state that you can work with to help identify people who you could hire through this program and you'll get the tax credit and then Summer Youth, it's a summer youth. If you're hiring seasonal workers this is something, look into it. Anyway why don't more people file for WOTC? Why File for WOTC Honestly it's really underutilized because it sounds bad. I mean it sounds like you have to hire, you have to do prejudicial or some discriminatory hiring practices and it seems very complicated because it used to be very complicated. You also used to have a very short time period only 28 days from date of hire to file the paperwork, right now you actually have until July 15th because of the CARES Act. So you can file WOTC every single time you hire somebody, it's just have them fill out one form 8850 that they fill as part of their onboarding process and then what you claim is you're claiming 40% of their eligible qualified wages up to the limit like up to that $9,000 so what the government wants to make sure is have you actually paid this person in the case of $9,000 like have you paid this person over $20,000 so that when you're getting the $9,000 credit back it's less than what you have actually paid them. They don't want people taking advantage of this but if somebody you know you hire somebody and after just three weeks they quit, you can still claim 25% of what you paid that person for the WOTC tax credits. How to Apply for WOTC So the way that you apply if you want to do this manually, so if you want to do this just on your own without Workstream, without WOTC.com like any of that there are five steps. You fill out the form , there's one other form for individual characteristics so it's a pre-screen form and then you're like oh this person looks like they might qualify. You give them this additional form and if it's the $9,000 credit that you want to file for for you know some there's a separate one for that but there's also the long-term unemployment recipient for people to say yes I was unemployed for a period of 27 weeks so they have to fill out a form there. Again you can tell employees like this benefits them because well I'll get to it on the next slide but basically it's like you were giving them an advantage because of these tax credits so you are asking them to fill this out as part of their employment process. Anyway fill out the forms, receive a determination and then you claim your tax credits yeah you can get them file them any time in the next 20 years. The way that we make this easy is the most complicated part of WOTC filing is that you have to identify who qualifies and you also have to figure out is it somebody in their family who is on these benefits and thus they qualify you as an employer. So what you basically do is have another company do all that background check and work for you. The other thing that is complicated is you need to submit the payroll proof that you paid this person. So, Workstream integrates with WOTC.com , that way you can just connect whatever payroll system you're doing or you just upload your payroll report and WOTC.com does all this work for you. They've s aved companies seven million dollars. That's how many tax credits WOTC.com has pushed for and they're based in New York City. So okay as an employer it seems like on average you are able to save like $55,000 if you're in food and beverage and you hire 100 people . How could you increase that by 10x? Like how can you get to the point where every single person you employ you know it at least qualifies you for $2,400 because they were on unemployment. You are allowed to use screener questions before you even choose who to interview to see if the applicant is likely to qualify you for WOTC credits. This sounds discriminatory, it is not. In fact the way that the laws written is if an employer has a choice between hiring two identical applicants, one of whom is eligible for WOTC and one of whom is not, the employer might opt to hire the WOTC eligible applicant. When you get applicants in and you're reviewing their resumes or their application, that is when you can screen and say I want to move these people all to the next stage because they are likely qualified for WOTC, the entire purpose of the WOTC program was to incentivize you to do that so you are not being discriminatory you are doing what WOTC is meant to do , which is help these people who have a hard time getting hired find employment and that way instead of the government paying them benefits, you as an employer are incentivized for you to pay them and so that they are able to work and that's why TANF and other program that are structured as like welfare-to-work is how they're framed. Workstream and WOTC.com Integration How to screen for screen with Workstream and WOTC.com? So what we do is we actually identify people who are likely eligible and then we ask them to complete additional WOTC forms, you as a hiring manager can just see like okay this person's getting a text message linked to their phone and they're getting an email and it says \"Hey please complete this form as part of your onboarding process.\" If they don't complete the form they get a little reminder \"Hey we haven't seen you fill out this form, could you please make sure to fill it out before your first day or on your first day.\" and so we take care of all of this sort of like sending the forms out, making sure they're filled out and getting them filed with the IRS within the 28-day window . You can use screener questions to identify the people . One thing that we're seeing people do a lot of is they're actually building a hiring pool of people who they want to hire for in the future, so a lot of companies right now they're posting on free job boards, Workstream allows you to post on 10 free job boards and I have positions that are live that applicants are coming into and the applicants are asked questions such as you know \"Hey could you send over a 30-second intro video of yourself and why you're interested in this position?\" and the other question that gets asked all the time is you know \"Hey are you or anyone else in your family currently receiving welfare food stamps?\" you know make sure you call them by their name SNAP benefits. Unemployment benefits. That's a question and then the next one is \"Are you between the ages of 18 and 40?\" or \"Are you over the age of 65?\" those types of questions the way that they're framed if you use the exact language from form 8850, you can do that in a way that's non-discriminatory but make sure to stay within those limits, when it comes to the over 65 part just ask if they are on the SSI benefits, you don't need to ask that they are over the age of 65 for instance so while the other ones say you know like we're seeing whether or not you qualify for WOTC, do you fit these characteristics and this is a voluntary optional thing. The other think you can have people do is you know like complete questions collect this information and then have it as a pool of applicants you can choose from later on when you are hiring so you can choose okay I want to invite these 30 people who have applied in the past few months to come in and schedule a zoom interview with me and they'll get a text message inviting them and saying like \"Hey I wanted to follow up on your application, just wanted to know if you are still interested. Here's a link to my calendar to find time for zoom interview if you're still interested and here is an updated job description.\" So then in Workstream what you can do is you can see okay here are all of the people who were contacted you know from applying to the job, here's everyone who filled in the form who you know is you can see like the form included the video interview and additional information there then you can see who of those people did you push through to request a phone call, an in-person interview, maybe there's a second one, you offer the job accepted, onboarded, you can do all that in Workstream. We also just right now because of what's going on the world really want to make sure people know about the video and virtual training and onboarding , so in addition to SMS text you can also send over video training, mobile quizzes, you can do all of the paperwork just e-signature so there's less passing between people unless you know unnecessary interaction and when you are training people you can do the embedded SlideShare with quizzes so lots of other things you can do there. We had so now that's pretty much the end of the webinar. We had some pre-submitted questions that I'm going to go through right now but yeah I am happy to take any questions you have, you can submit them through the little Q&A part. Cool. So I am going to stop sharing my screen so that I can see the questions. Okay great. Q&A: coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security CARES Act So one of the pre-submitted questions we had is what about the coronavirus aid relief and Economic Security CARES Act. So if you claim WOTC tax credits on an employee, you can also still get the credits that you could claim through the CARES Act as long as it isn't in the same time period. So if you claim tax credits the WOTC you apply it sometime in the next 20 years that's fine just don't claim it in the same tax period and then as part of the CARES Act you also have an extension on when you need to file WOTC paperwork usually it's 20 days instead it's July 15th just like all of our taxes are due. Well now guys please feel free to post in the Q&A section or in the chat you can also just post directly to me as a panelist in the chat. Okay cool so another question I have is let me see. Q&A: Employees Participation Question is do employees need to participate? So participation is completely voluntary , you can let them know when you're asking these questions that it increases their chances of employment because and use the standard sentence from WOTC. This is something we have built into Workstream so it's like there's a standard template of responses to make sure that you're following the law by the book. Q&A: Popular Tax Credits Yeah another question just came through anonymous yeah okay so what are the most popular ones? The most popular tax credits I touched on this briefly before but they're the SNAP recipients so people who are on food stamps . They make up typically 70% of the people who ended up being qualified for WOTC credits. The next highest is Veterans and what's interesting is that the veterans group is the smallest group of people who in the United States should be qualified but 7% of the WOTC credits filed are for veterans. So this just goes to the misconception again that WOTC is really available for hiring like veterans and ex-felons which is not the case. Q&A: Availability of WOTC Credits Okay we had a question. WOTC credits are only available upon hire though no ongoing credits if you continue to employ the person in subsequent years. Okay so the way WOTC credits work is when you hire them you have to file immediately. The reason for that is they don't want you doing like oh I realized later and this had no impact on my hiring. They want the WOTC credits to like impact your hiring decisions but you have ongoing credits in the sense that you choose which year to apply the tax credits from that specific person. So if you get $2,400 in tax credits because you hired somebody who is on unemployment, you will be able to choose. I'm going to apply this in five years from now when I have taxes to pay so in that sense it's ongoing. The Long Term Temporary Assistance I know it's an oxymoron but the Long Term Temporary Assistance something N F like TANF the welfare program Those are applied over two years so instead of just getting that for hiring somebody for the first year, you get half the credits the first year and half the second but with the rest it's like you basically get them as soon as you have paid the person at least what is it like 2.5x what you're claiming because only 40% of their eligible wages are able to be claimed by you. So if you're claiming $2,400 and tax credits you are able to claim that once you've paid the person like six or seven thousand dollars because 40% of that is the $2,400 that you're claiming. I'm making this more complicated than it is. It's a little bit complicated which is why Workstream has the integration with WOTC.com and the tax professionals take care of all this to maximize your credits. Q&A: SNAP Qualification Time Frame Is there a minimum time someone has to be on SNAP to qualify? Sure so let me go back to that side. Okay So the to answer your question, the minimum someone needs to be on food stamps to qualify is for a period of six months up until you know the day that they joined your employment or they've received it for three months so sorry it's three months is the minimum if the person who you're hiring is the one who is receiving food stamps but if it was a family member such as their children which is usually the case, that child had to have received food stamps for a six-month period up until they were employed. So the minimum is three months within the last five month period. If it's the employee six months, if it's the family member but yeah let me know if you have any additional questions about that and again through Workstream in WOTC.com we take care of all of this so it's just by the book of okay this person filled out a form and they follow up with them and get the additional information and they make recommendations about how you can find more of these people so you can claim more tax credits. Cool. Well unless there are any other questions I think that wraps up today. I want to thank everyone who tuned in, you can contact me lydia@workstream.is if you have any additional questions and there's also a WOTC guide if you go to Workstream.us and you go to resources, ebooks. There's a very long very thorough guide that covers all the has all of the locations that you could be claiming somebody for the Designated Community Residents so it's also really helpful to see which counties nearby and which urban areas within for instance within Baltimore within New York City within LA you know to understand how where people need to live to be able to claim a $2400 there. So anyway thank you guys again for tuning in and then we have another webinar next Wednesday at 11 a.m. so please check it out and look forward to seeing you then. Thanks.

Even in a competitive market, employees know there are other options out there if their current job isn't working. A startling 30% of employees have left a job within 90 days of starting , and that number is often higher in the QSR space. If you are interested in boosting employee retention, you've got to set employees up for success as quickly as possible. In this article, we break down the steps you can take in the first 90 days to make work meaningful and maximize employee retention. But before we do that, a quick reminder of why employee retention matters: Losing employees is expensive! The average cost to hire and train one hourly employee can be upwards of $5K. Turnover negatively impacts customer satisfaction. We’ve all experience understaffed quick-service restaurants, and can probably recall some specific ways that the overall experience suffered as a result. Turnover is contagious. Lower employee retention means your remaining team might need to work harder or longer hours to pick up the slack. Alternately, losing seasoned workers has a negative effect on your ability to effectively train new hires. Now that we’ve established why employee retention is so important in the franchise and QSR space, let’s cover some specific things you can do to improve retention by focusing on the first 90 days: 1. Start with a clear job description One of the best ways to set employees up for success is starting with a crystal clear job description . Job descriptions set the tone for what you expect from an employee and help them understand how to be a great hire. Bad hires can cost your organization thousands of dollars . Lack of alignment between employees and companies is one of the biggest factors when it comes to lackluster employee retention. You want to set standards so everyone is on the same page. 2. Create a structured onboarding program Once an employee is selected, you need to provide them with a structured onboarding process. Instead of throwing employees into the deep end, companies should create a process that slowly integrates new employees into the company. Many organizations use a 90-day onboarding process that’s broken down into three segments: Day 1-30: The first thirty days are all about learning . In this phase, employees are being trained and closely monitored. Managers will likely watch these employees very closely and teach them all the tricks of the trade. Day 31-60: The next thirty days are all about contributing . During this phase, managers give employees more leeway to contribute to the company. Workers may still make mistakes, but they have much more autonomy and should know some parts of the job without help. Day 61-90: The last thirty days are all about mastery . By this section of the onboarding program, employees should show signs of mastery in their job. They should be able to lean on managers less and take care of most issues independently. 3. Collaborate on goal setting for the first 90 days It’s essential to help each new hire set SMART goals (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based) that they will work to achieve during the first 90 days of employment. Goals give employees something to look forward to when onboarding becomes tough. If they are consistently making progress on their goals, they are doing great, even if working is challenging. Managers and workers should collaborate to work on what those goals are. Goals might look slightly different depending on the person you are working with. For example, an employee holding their first job must cover different material than someone with previous experience in your industry. When you collaborate with the new hire, you can further structure your onboarding plan and create one that fits their needs and skill level. 4. Create progress checkpoints during the onboarding process 90 days flies by in the blink of an eye. If you are not careful, employees can watch that time pass without making any progress on their goals and skills. Employees will enjoy their job more if they see that they are making progress while being able to correct errors as they happen. Creating progress checkpoints lets employees and employers get a pulse on what's going well and what could be going better. Often these checkpoints happen at the end of every thirty-day period. Provide regular feedback to new hires throughout the onboarding experience Feedback is an essential part of the onboarding experience. Employees need to hear all the good (and bad) feedback you have for them. Don't wait for feedback to pile up. Find ways to share it early and often. Dumping negative feedback can make it challenging for employees to hear. No one wants to listen to a list of 50 things they are doing wrong. Instead, find teachable moments, in the moment, to correct negative behavior. Use recognition to reward employees for their onboarding success If you’ve got praise, share it. Recognize your staff for all the hard work they are doing to succeed in their new role. You can share this praise during team meetings, in one-on-one conversations, or using your company’s internal messaging system. These recommendations might seem straight forward, but they go a long way when it comes to boosting employee retention. 5. Offer training and development opportunities to new hires Training is an essential aspect of the onboarding process. According to Shift , 40% of workers who don't get the training they need will leave in the first year. Companies cannot expect employees to succeed if they aren't given the proper training. New team members need proper opportunities to learn the job without fear of retribution. Your new workers might make a costly mistake, but it's all about helping them learn and become better employees. Everyone has different learning styles that impact how they absorb information. While some workers may be able to listen to an instructor or watch a video to learn, others may have to work through an actual scenario to understand the information they are being presented. Training isn’t an eight-hour shift on a busy weeknight. It requires time, patience, and attention. 6. Don’t forget to create moments for ownership during the first 90 days Ownership is essential to the onboarding process. When employees can say, \"I accomplished this on my own!\" it makes for a positive experience. You may not be able to trust a new hire to close a store by themselves, but is there a part of the closing process that you can defer to them? Break big tasks into smaller chunks and help employees feel comfortable taking ownership of those experiences. Before you know it, you'll be able to give new workers more significant tasks because they'll have the confidence needed to take on those responsibilities. 7. Survey your new hires to see how you can improve the experience It can be challenging to know if you are getting the onboarding experience right. You should elicit feedback from new hires to see where you excel and where you can improve as a company. Keep these surveys short and ask questions that don't require personal information. Anonymous feedback can help new hires (who may feel vulnerable) open up about their experience. Take this feedback seriously. New hires are the only people who can tell you how effective your onboarding program is. Boost retention by creating a world-class onboarding experience The first 90 days at a new job can be tough. There are new faces to learn, vocabulary to memorize, and rules to remember. As overwhelming as it can be, starting a new job is also exciting. It can be a fresh start for workers wanting to change their lives. Employees are becoming more aware of a job's impact on their lives. They want to work for a company that values them and their contributions enough to set them up for success from the start. Throwin your team to the wolves doesn’t work. Investing in a structured training program will. 30-60-90 Day Onboarding Challenge Are you ready to create a world-class onboarding experience?

Look over each job description to ensure it’s easy to read and understand. Ask for feedback to ensure your job descriptions are clear and helpful. Select a qualified applicant Based on your standards, pick a qualified candidate to hire. Share the required paperwork Ideally, much of this paperwork can be completed digitally before the employee’s first day. Announce the new hire internally Once you know an employee is joining, introduce them to the company. Let your team know how to interact and connect with the new employee. Day 1-30: Learning Complete any remaining paperwork Within the first few days of your new hire’s start date, their onboarding paperwork should be completed. Ask managers to shout out employees who fill out their onboarding paperwork quickly and efficiently. Set 90 day onboarding goals Chat with your new hire to set SMART goals for their first 90 days. Consider how the phases of onboarding might require different levels of mastery. Immerse new hires in your company culture During the first month, employees should be getting to know your company and what you stand for. Teach employees about your company mission, vision, and values by playing a game of company-centered Jeopardy. Help new hires get to know their colleagues Team building is critical. Encourage your new hires to get to know who they’ll be working with. Ask managers to host team building sessions in all meetings with a new hire attending. Complete: 30 day check-In At the end of the first 30 days, ask each manager to sit down with their new hires. What’s working? What can be improved? What do they want to see in the next 30 days? Day 31-60: Contributing Small project By the end of the first 30 days, employees should be able to handle a small project or task on their own. Assign each new hire a special project they can complete that will improve the company. For example, a cashier could organize the condiment station at a restaurant. Create cross-functional bond Work doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Cashiers might need to work with cooks. Staff going into the field will need to work with employees at the main office. Assign a cross-functional project for new hires to work on. Focus on skill development By the second month, you should be able to see where your new team member may be lacking. Focus on those areas with development exercises that target their needs. Complete: 60 day training check-in The 60-day check-in is all about determining what has been accomplished and what’s left for employees to be seen as fully integrated into your culture. Create a plan to address gaps in development in the next thirty days. Day 61-90: Mastery Assign a mentor As employees move into the mastery stage, they need a partner outside of their manager to continue to grow. Pair the new hire with an experienced employee who can act as a mentor and provide guidance throughout their career development within the company. Complete: Project ownership New hires should take ownership of a project by the time they are in the last thirty days of onboarding. Assign the new hire a more substantial project or task that requires them to take ownership and demonstrate their ability to work independently. Provide support and guidance as needed. Senior leadership exposure Senior leaders play an important role in employee development. Make sure that workers are given face time with higher-level managers. Invite senior leaders to a team meeting to get to know new hires.
