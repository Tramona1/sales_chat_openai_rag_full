Unfortunately, this happens less often than you’d think. A Gallup study revealed that 51% of currently employed adults in the US are searching for new jobs or watching for new job opportunities. 47% of participants believe that “now” is a good time to find a quality job. Needless to say, plenty of people are actively looking to jump ship and join another company. At this rate, many organizations simply accept high turnover as the norm. In the world of convenience stores, turnover rates are particularly high : 121% in 2017, improving slightly in 2018 to 118%. While many seem perfectly happy to accept this as the status quo, it doesn’t really mean that there’s nothing you can do on your part to improve this statistic. To understand why employees would leave a company, HR consultancy Kepner-Tregoe conducted a survey with 1,290 respondents. They found that 64% of the respondents believed that the company's management wasn't initiating programs to reduce turnover, or make the company more attractive to those seeking work. This means that employers themselves have a lot of work to do in order to increase retention rates. Here’s what you need to do. Build Your EVP To attract and even retain the best hourly workers for your convenience stores, a business must first develop its own Employee Value Proposition (EVP) . EVP is essentially a fancy term which is defined by the total value an employer offers to their employees in return for their work. It is more than tangible benefits like compensation and employee benefits. Rather, it is a mix of both tangible and intangible rewards that have no inherent monetary value, but keep employees feeling recognized and motivated. This can include a company culture that encourages autonomy, meaningful projects to work on, as well as flexible working hours . With all that in mind, here are five ways you can work on your EVP to help make your company more appealing in the eyes of potential quality hourly employees: 1. Create an Encouraging Work Environment The daily workload is hard enough as it is, so don't make it more difficult for your hourly workers, many of whom are earning minimum wage. Making small changes in the way you communicate with them can go a long way. For example, instead of criticizing them for making small mistakes, turn it into an opportunity to talk about how they can improve. If an employee is underperforming, take the time to talk to them and understand the context of the situation before issuing a warning or memo. Instead of taking high quality work as the norm, thank your hourly employees for their hard work. Even without actively marketing your company as one with an encouraging work environment, word will naturally spread as more people talk about the little ways you communicate fairly with your employees. 2. Offer More Than Just Basic Compensation You don't have to break the bank just to offer competitive remuneration and benefits. Go the extra mile to show that you truly care for your hourly team in other ways. For example, Starbucks recently partnered with mental health platform Lyra Health to provide all its US employees and eligible partners with access to 20 free sessions with a mental health therapist . Meanwhile, the coffee giant also paid its employees for 30 days starting March 20 amidst the coronavirus outbreak . This is regardless of whether or not their employees show up for work. In doing so, the brand has really shown that it cares for its employees through its compensation programs. Another option that many employers consider standard is providing paid sick leave, which is already a huge help for your employees. Go ahead and be creative in how you can show your appreciation to your hourly workers. After all, you wouldn’t be a successful business owner if not for them. 3. Develop a Great Company Culture Company culture can be defined as shared beliefs and values established by leaders . These are then communicated throughout the entire team and further reinforced. A strong company culture is vital for success . To have a strong culture, one needs to be a values-based organization where the employees’ and company’s values are aligned. An example of a great organizational value is diversity, as it provides you with more perspectives from people from different backgrounds . 4. Provide Career Stability Another way to make your business attractive is to offer your business as a springboard to a career. Offer resources for growth and advancement such as an onsite library, opportunities to attend seminars, classes, and conferences, and even career counselor visitations every quarter. You should also be able to show them a clear career progression path should they stay with you and do well. In January 2020, the fast-food giant launched its Archways to Careers app which connects employees to professionals at InsideTrack, a McDonald's partner and coaching organization. The app also builds on the Archways to Opportunity program which helps workers learn English, get a high school diploma, and provides financial aid for college tuition fees. 5. Offer Flexibility Even if your business is dependent on having employees on site during specific hours, like a restaurant or retail store, you can still provide some flexibility in scheduling to allow them time off for family, school, and other activities. You will attract more candidates and keep the employees you have longer when you help them balance both work and life activities. This will show that you care about their personal lives. Promote Your Brand and Culture Everyone is on the internet these days. So don’t be shy and go tell the world what an awesome employer you are! Use social media to get the word out. Post job ads on Facebook, Instagram, or even LinkedIn. Don’t be afraid to write about how great your EVP is (once you’ve put in the work to improve it, that is) and let your ideal prospects find their way to you. You can also post on online job boards such as Indeed and Craigslist . There, you can also write a detailed job description which talks about your company culture too.

We recommend using Hourly Wage Index data as a starting point. Once you have established a baseline for certain positions, do further research into similar businesses in your area.

    "text": "HOURLY WAGE INDEX Let’s talk wages in Denver Back to home Back to  Colorado $13.65 What is the minimum wage in Denver? Denver is a large and growing city with a diverse economy. As a result, the minimum wage and average wage in Denver vary depending on the industry and occupation. The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour. However, many states and cities have set their own minimum wages that are higher than the federal minimum. I n Denver, the minimum wage is currently $13.65 per hour for all employees, regardless of age or tipped status. This is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage. In recent years, there has been a growing debate about the impact of the minimum wage on employment. Some argue that raising the minimum wage will lead to job losses, while others believe that it will help to boost the economy by putting more money in the pockets of low-wage workers. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would create 1.4 million jobs nationwide and boost the economy by $54 billion. However, a study by the Congressional Budget Office found that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would reduce employment by 500,000 jobs. The impact of the minimum wage on employment is a complex issue, and there is no clear consensus among economists. However, it is clear that the minimum wage has a significant impact on the lives of low-wage workers. By raising the minimum wage, we can help to ensure that all workers earn a living wage and have the opportunity to achieve economic security. The Impact of the Minimum Wage on Workers The minimum wage has a number of positive impacts on workers. It can help to raise their standard of living, reduce poverty, and boost the economy. Increased standard of living: The minimum wage can help to raise workers' standard of living by increasing their earnings. This can help workers to afford basic necessities such as housing, food, and clothing. Reduced poverty: The minimum wage can help to reduce poverty by lifting workers out of low-wage jobs. This can help to improve workers' health, well-being, and economic security. Boosted economy: The minimum wage can boost the economy by increasing consumer spending. When workers earn more money, they are able to spend more money on goods and services. This can lead to increased demand for goods and services, which can create jobs and boost economic growth. The Impact of the Minimum Wage on Businesses The minimum wage can also have some negative impacts on businesses. It can increase their labor costs, which can lead to higher prices for consumers. It can also make it more difficult for businesses to compete with businesses that are located in areas with lower minimum wages. Increased labor costs: The minimum wage can increase businesses' labor costs by requiring them to pay their workers more money. This can lead to higher prices for consumers, as businesses pass on their increased labor costs to their customers. Competition: The minimum wage can make it more difficult for businesses to compete with businesses that are located in areas with lower minimum wages. This is because businesses in areas with lower minimum wages are able to pay their workers less money, which can give them a competitive advantage. Conclusion The minimum wage is a complex issue with both positive and negative impacts. It is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of the minimum wage before making a decision about whether or not to raise it. In the case of Denver, the benefits of raising the minimum wage likely outweigh the drawbacks. The city has a strong economy and a high cost of living, so raising the minimum wage would help to ensure that all workers have a living wage. Additionally, the impact on businesses would likely be minimal, as most businesses in Denver are already paying their workers more than the minimum wage. Overall, raising the minimum wage in Denver would be a positive step for the city and its residents. It would help to raise the standard of living for low-wage workers, reduce poverty, and boost the economy. $32.35 What is the average wage in Denver? The average wage in Denver is also higher than the national average. In 2021, the average annual wage in Denver was $67,295, compared to the national average of $56,310. This means that most workers in Denver earn significantly more than the minimum wage. However, there are still many workers in Denver who struggle to make ends meet. The high cost of living in Denver can make it difficult for even those with good-paying jobs to afford housing, food, and other necessities. Frequently asked questions What is the difference between gross wages and net wages? It's important to remember that the Hourly Wage Index data above reflects gross wages, or the amount of money an employee earns before accounting for payroll deductions like taxes, benefits, or wage garnishments. Due to variability in tax rates across locations, slightly lower gross wages in a certain location might result in higher take home pay, or vice versa. What is a good hourly wage? This question is a difficult one to answer, as a \"good hourly wage\" is highly subjective according to experience, work responsibilities, cost of living, and other factors. We recommend using Hourly Wage Index data as a starting point. Once you have established a baseline for certain positions, do further research into similar businesses in your area. Lastly, consider surveying your employees. They're the best resource to help you know what is a good hourly wage, what competitive pay looks like in your location, and how competitive wages change in your industry over time.

Frequently asked questions What is the difference between gross wages and net wages? It's important to remember that the Hourly Wage Index data above reflects gross wages, or the amount of money an employee earns before accounting for payroll deductions like taxes, benefits, or wage garnishments. Due to variability in tax rates across locations, slightly lower gross wages in a certain location might result in higher take home pay, or vice versa. What is a good hourly wage? This question is a difficult one to answer, as a \"good hourly wage\" is highly subjective according to experience, work responsibilities, cost of living, and other factors.

    "text": "HOURLY WAGE INDEX Let’s talk wages in San Francisco Back to home Back to  California $18.07 What is the minimum wage in San Francisco? San Francisco is one of the most expensive cities in the United States, so it's no surprise that the minimum wage is higher than in many other places. As of July 1, 2023, the minimum wage in San Francisco is $18.07 per hour for all employees, regardless of age or tipped status. This is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. In recent years, there has been a growing debate about the impact of the minimum wage on employment. Some argue that raising the minimum wage will lead to job losses, while others believe that it will help to boost the economy by putting more money in the pockets of low-wage workers. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would create 1.4 million jobs nationwide and boost the economy by $54 billion. However, a study by the Congressional Budget Office found that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would reduce employment by 500,000 jobs. The impact of the minimum wage on employment is a complex issue, and there is no clear consensus among economists. However, it is clear that the minimum wage has a significant impact on the lives of low-wage workers. By raising the minimum wage, we can help to ensure that all workers earn a living wage and have the opportunity to achieve economic security. The Impact of the Minimum Wage on Workers The minimum wage has a number of positive impacts on workers. It can help to raise their standard of living, reduce poverty, and boost the economy. Increased standard of living: The minimum wage can help to raise workers' standard of living by increasing their earnings. This can help workers to afford basic necessities such as housing, food, and clothing. Reduced poverty: The minimum wage can help to reduce poverty by lifting workers out of low-wage jobs. This can help to improve workers' health, well-being, and economic security. Boosted economy: The minimum wage can boost the economy by increasing consumer spending. When workers earn more money, they are able to spend more money on goods and services. This can lead to increased demand for goods and services, which can create jobs and boost economic growth. The Impact of the Minimum Wage on Businesses The minimum wage can also have some negative impacts on businesses. It can increase their labor costs, which can lead to higher prices for consumers. It can also make it more difficult for businesses to compete with businesses that are located in areas with lower minimum wages. Increased labor costs: The minimum wage can increase businesses' labor costs by requiring them to pay their workers more money. This can lead to higher prices for consumers, as businesses pass on their increased labor costs to their customers. Competition: The minimum wage can make it more difficult for businesses to compete with businesses that are located in areas with lower minimum wages. This is because businesses in areas with lower minimum wages are able to pay their workers less money, which can give them a competitive advantage. Conclusion The minimum wage is a complex issue with both positive and negative impacts. It is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of the minimum wage before making a decision about whether or not to raise it. $55.64 What is the average wage in San Francisco? The average wage in San Francisco is also higher than the national average. In 2021, the average annual wage in San Francisco was $115,750, compared to the national average of $56,310. This means that most workers in San Francisco earn significantly more than the minimum wage. However, there are still many workers in San Francisco who struggle to make ends meet. The high cost of living in San Francisco can make it difficult for even those with good-paying jobs to afford housing, food, and other necessities.

    "text": "HOURLY WAGE INDEX Let’s talk wages in Atlanta Back to home Back to  Georgia $10.50 What is the minimum wage in Atlanta? Atlanta is a large and growing city with a diverse economy. As a result, the minimum wage and average wage in Atlanta vary depending on the industry and occupation. The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour. However, many states and cities have set their own minimum wages that are higher than the federal minimum. In Atlanta, the minimum wage is currently $10.50 per hour for all employees, regardless of age or tipped status. This is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage. In recent years, there has been a growing debate about the impact of the minimum wage on employment. Some argue that raising the minimum wage will lead to job losses, while others believe that it will help to boost the economy by putting more money in the pockets of low-wage workers. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would create 1.4 million jobs nationwide and boost the economy by $54 billion. However, a study by the Congressional Budget Office found that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would reduce employment by 500,000 jobs. The impact of the minimum wage on employment is a complex issue, and there is no clear consensus among economists. However, it is clear that the minimum wage has a significant impact on the lives of low-wage workers. By raising the minimum wage, we can help to ensure that all workers earn a living wage and have the opportunity to achieve economic security. The Impact of the Minimum Wage on Workers The minimum wage has a number of positive impacts on workers. It can help to raise their standard of living, reduce poverty, and boost the economy. Increased standard of living: The minimum wage can help to raise workers' standard of living by increasing their earnings. This can help workers to afford basic necessities such as housing, food, and clothing. Reduced poverty: The minimum wage can help to reduce poverty by lifting workers out of low-wage jobs. This can help to improve workers' health, well-being, and economic security. Boosted economy: The minimum wage can boost the economy by increasing consumer spending. When workers earn more money, they are able to spend more money on goods and services. This can lead to increased demand for goods and services, which can create jobs and boost economic growth. The Impact of the Minimum Wage on Businesses The minimum wage can also have some negative impacts on businesses. It can increase their labor costs, which can lead to higher prices for consumers. It can also make it more difficult for businesses to compete with businesses that are located in areas with lower minimum wages. Increased labor costs: The minimum wage can increase businesses' labor costs by requiring them to pay their workers more money. This can lead to higher prices for consumers, as businesses pass on their increased labor costs to their customers. Competition: The minimum wage can make it more difficult for businesses to compete with businesses that are located in areas with lower minimum wages. This is because businesses in areas with lower minimum wages are able to pay their workers less money, which can give them a competitive advantage. Conclusion The minimum wage is a complex issue with both positive and negative impacts. It is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of the minimum wage before making a decision about whether or not to raise it. In the case of Atlanta, the benefits of raising the minimum wage likely outweigh the drawbacks. The city has a strong economy and a high cost of living, so raising the minimum wage would help to ensure that all workers have a living wage. Additionally, the impact on businesses would likely be minimal, as most businesses in Atlanta are already paying their workers more than the minimum wage. Overall, raising the minimum wage in Atlanta would be a positive step for the city and its residents. It would help to raise the standard of living for low-wage workers, reduce poverty, and boost the economy. $30.28 What is the average wage in Atlanta? The average wage in Atlanta is also higher than the national average. In 2022, the average annual wage in Atlanta was $63,000, compared to the national average of $56,310. This means that most workers in Atlanta earn significantly more than the minimum wage. However, there are still many workers in Atlanta who struggle to make ends meet. The high cost of living in Atlanta can make it difficult for even those with good-paying jobs to afford housing, food, and other necessities.

Increased economic security: The minimum wage can help to increase economic security for low-wage workers by giving them a safety net in case of unexpected expenses. Negative Impacts Job losses: Some businesses may lay off workers in response to an increase in the minimum wage. This is because the higher wage will increase their costs, which may make it difficult for them to stay in business. Reduced hours: Some businesses may reduce the hours of their workers in response to an increase in the minimum wage.
