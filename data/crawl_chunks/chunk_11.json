As such, you would want to pay special attention to how these gung-ho team members perform the necessary tasks. We all want employees who are self-starters and take on responsibilities above and beyond what is expected of them, but if these employees put in more than 40 hours in a week, and are not paid at the overtime rate due to them, employers can get in a lot of trouble. And this includes both the company and individual managers. Even if the employee volunteers to work over 40 hours without the required additional time and a half pay, the employer becomes liable and can be sued in court. If found guilty, they can be out thousands of dollars in damages while destroying the reputation of the company. Unfortunately, the confusion and misunderstanding business executives have with these ever-changing rules has caused some businesses to suffer the consequences. Even the unintentional flouting of overtime rules has been very costly to the point of shutting some businesses down. To ensure compliance, here are some helpful tips to help you get a grip on the current overtime rules. Why the Overtime Rule? The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) dictates when an employee should receive his/her overtime pay. According to the FLSA, \"Unless specifically exempted, employees covered by the Act must receive overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek at a rate not less than time and one-half their regular rates of pay. There is no limit in the Act on the number of hours employees aged 16 and older may work in any workweek. The Act does not require overtime pay for work on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, or regular days of rest, as such.\" According to the FLSA, this law was created to remedy harmful labor conditions which can worsen the standard of living of employees. Not protecting them from such detrimental conditions can affect their health, efficiency and general well-being, which will, in turn, have a negative impact on the company. However, not every worker is affected by this law as the FLSA only applies to those who meet the criteria stated by the act. Currently, all employers need to comply with FLSA, which says that certain salaried employees—for example, managers and those with advanced knowledge \"in a field of science or learning\" such as medicine—are exempt from being able to earn overtime pay if they make: More than $455 per week; or Over $23,660 a year Determining Overtime Many business owners believe that the overtime rules only apply to hourly workers, but that is not so. Do not let this confuse you or bog you down too much. If you use an accountant or payroll service, they should be up to speed on these overtime rules. This is how the FLSA explains it: For the salary for a workweek exceeding 40 hours: A fixed salary for a regular workweek longer than 40 hours does not discharge FLSA statutory obligations. For example, an employee may be hired to work a 45-hour workweek for a weekly salary of $405. In this instance the regular rate is obtained by dividing the $405 straight-time salary by 45 hours, resulting in a regular rate of $9.00. The employee is then due additional overtime computed by multiplying the 5 overtime hours by one-half the regular rate of pay ($4.50 x 5 = $22.50). Another important thing to note is that the Department of Labor recently proposed a new rule on March 7, 2019, that came into effect in January 2020: Workers who do not earn at least $35,308 a year ($679 a week) would have to be paid overtime, even if they're classified as a manager or professional Non-discretionary bonuses and incentive payments (including commissions) paid on an annual or more frequent basis may be used to satisfy up to 10 percent of the standard salary level. The special rule for highly compensated employees would require workers to earn a total annual compensation of at least $147,414 ($679 of which must be paid weekly on a salary or fee basis). The Department of Labor intends to propose an update to the salary threshold every four years to ensure that these levels continue to provide reasonable cases of exemption. Updates would not be automatic and would continue to require notice-and-comment rule making. Understanding Overtime Rules Here are three things you can do to ensure you are complying with the overtime rules and staying up to date with any changes the US government may make: Stay in tune with overtime rules so that you can stay abreast with any overtime rule changes. As stated by SHRM, you need to anticipate that state or federal wage and hour authorities may audit your organization randomly. This can be pursuant to an enforcement emphasis, or as a result of a complaint from an employee or a competitor. If you remain vigilant, you will be more prepared to ensure your company is compliant with all the overtime rules. Create written policies that communicate to everyone, including employees, the steps being taken to comply with all FLSA overtime rules as well as any state rules that may apply. Including these in the onboarding documents after hiring them can be useful to ensure that they are well aware of the regulations the company has to adhere to. At Workstream, we help you send your onboarding documents automatically to your new hires as soon as they are hired. These documents are sent through text and alerts will also be automated to ensure that the paperwork is complete before they officially begin work. Through this, you save the hassle of chasing them for the signed documents necessary for their onboarding. Staying ahead of any changes to the overtime rules is also a good practice. You can do this by adding the FLSA and DOL website to your favorites on your computer and refer to them regularly. They will provide you with updates pertaining to the overtime rules that you need to know. Stay updated with the hiring trends in the industry by subscribing to our blog !

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 06/05/23 Steal these hiring automation tricks (and thank us later) Share this article What would it mean to your bottom line if you could bring new hourly workers into your business faster? Whether you’re hiring rapidly to meet seasonal demand or adding a few team members at a time, building automation into your hiring process can help you move faster and get the right people in the door (before they go somewhere else). Let’s uncover how automation can improve sourcing, the applicant experience, and the recruiting/hiring manager experience. Sourcing When you’re trying to find applicants for a role, it can feel like an uphill battle. You might find yourself lowering your standards to hire faster (because you don’t have time to find the best person for the job). But, if we take our time to source the right people, we’ll see increased retention and improvements to company culture improvements . Here are a few examples of how automation can help you source the best talent. Focus on better job descriptions A well-written job description is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal. But all too often, companies make simple mistakes that can deter good candidates from applying, like: Lack of salary transparency Gendered language Culture mismatch between the description and perception of the company A LinkedIn study revealed that 61% of applicants are looking for compensation in a job description. Optimizing your job descriptions to attract the right applicants doesn’t have to be time-consuming. There are many online tools and templates that help you build a thoughtful job description in seconds. Tools like ours use AI to generate job descriptions based on your inputs and best practices sourced from thousands of successful job descriptions across the web. Optimize posting times Once you have a strong job description, you need to post it to job search sites. When and where you post is almost as important as what you post. You don’t want your job to get lost in a sea of other listings. Companies like LinkedIn can analyze a ton of data about job postings, including what gets viewed and when people apply for roles. According to their data , 21% of views and 20% of job applications happen on Monday. However, only 7% of views and 8% of job applications occur on Sundays. With these insights, you can time when you publish your job postings and hopefully get more visibility. Applicant experience Next, it’s important to understand how automation can greatly help the applicant experience. Applicants deal with a ton of stress when searching for a job. According to FastCasual , hourly workers send out an average of eight job applications to get a single offer. On top of that, data from Appcast shows that 92% of people never finish a job application. As a hiring manager, this should be a big cause for pause. Thankfully, automation can make applying and hiring easier for everyone. Make applying easier One of the most frustrating experiences for an applicant is being asked to upload their resume and then being asked to write out their experience in another part of the application. In an ideal world, applications should cut out one part of this equation. Companies like LinkedIn and Indeed have simplified this process with “easy apply” features that copy over resumes or job histories. Simple automation like this will save your applicant time and reduce data entry errors. Another way to make applying to your open roles easier is to keep applications on file for a specific period. For example, you might have three available cashier roles in a year. Keeping everything on file for a year will give applicants an easy way to apply as you list new opportunities throughout the year. Many applicant tracking systems offer features like the ones above to help you make your application process easy for the end user. Check out our guide to help you find the right one for your business . Automate next steps and follow-ups Once an applicant submits an application, where does it go? Following up with applicants is important so they know where you are in the hiring process. Thankfully, many of these messages can be automated so hiring managers can spend more time on face-to-face communication with applicants. Here are some messages you can automate to keep applicants engaged without having to put in the manual work: Send an automated email when you receive an application to inform the applicant you received it. While you’re working through applications, send an automated text or email to let applicants know a bit more about your company, the culture, and what to expect next. Send automated rejection emails to anyone who isn’t a good fit. Text or email reminders to applicants about upcoming interviews so you can reduce candidate ghosting . Send automated reminders to complete new hire paperwork so applicants can complete onboarding before day 1 on the job. Many applicant tracking systems enable you to set up automated messages at key points throughout the hiring process. Hiring manager/recruiter experience Last, it’s crucial to understand how automation can make recruiters' and hiring managers' lives easier. Whether your company is hiring a ton of hourly workers or just backfilling a few positions, recruiting is challenging. Often recruiters get so caught up in the grind of admin tasks that they forget to make time to create personal connections with potential employees. That’s where automating tedious HR tasks can make a big difference. The key is to know where you should automate and where you still need to provide that personal touch . Here are our recommendations. Use smart screening technology to make the best of your time As jobs continue to receive hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of applications depending on your market, screening applicants has become even more important for hiring managers. As a recruiter, you know what you’re looking for in a potential candidate. Screening tools surface applicants that meet your qualifications, so you don’t waste time on those that don’t. Instead of sifting through all the applications that come in, smart screening tools let you customize your application based on the role, use logic to advance the right applicants to the interview stage automatically, and block repeat applicants that just don’t make sense for your organization. Invest in a calendar scheduling system Scheduling interviews is a time-consuming task. If you’re getting hundreds of applications for a single location, scheduling those interviews manually would be a full-time job in itself. Not to mention the back-and-forth that inevitably comes with the territory. Look for an applicant tracking system that enables candidates to schedule their own interviews. Solutions like Workstream allow applicants to schedule their interviews over text based on your hiring managers’ availability. The time savings here are major—applicants can schedule their interview in under a minute! Send weekly automated reports about your hiring progress Keeping up with data about your hiring progress can feel daunting. Applicant tracking systems take in an avalanche of data, but it’s not always relevant to your current needs. One of the best things about these systems is that they can often pre-build helpful reports and send the most critical data to you regularly. For example, you may want to track a hiring metric like hiring performance by source to see if your applicants from Indeed are doing better than the ones you source from a community-based organization. You could set up your applicant tracking software to send you a regular report about this progress straight to your inbox. Once you set it up once, you’ll get the best data without clicking around in analytics every time. Create a stellar hourly recruiting process with automation While there is a lot of debate about the pros and cons of automation, it has created some net positive results for recruiting. Automation doesn’t have to be scary or intrusive. From ChatGPT helping you write the first draft of an email to a calendar scheduler helping you automate appointment settings and reminders, automation can be a timesaver. Recruiting is a uniquely human experience. People join people. But, we can use automation to offload tedious tasks so we can focus on the star of recruiting: finding exceptional applicants.

These dedicated employees are the backbone of our economy, playing critical roles in industries like retail, hospitality, food and beverage, and manufacturing. Yet, when it comes to how they're hired, managed, and paid, employers aren't always equipped with the right technology to take care of their teams. 80% of the global workforce is comprised of hourly workers The challenge? Many businesses are still using the same standard solutions designed for office workers—tools that simply don't offer the flexibility, ease, and self-service options that an hourly workforce needs. Even more concerning is the fact that some businesses continue to rely on outdated paperwork and manual processes to manage their teams. What is an HR tech stack? To increase your operational efficiency, you need to build a collection of tools (or acquire an all-in-one solution) that helps you digitally manage HR tasks. An HR tech stack helps automate many of the tasks that were once performed manually by human resources teams—such as hiring, onboarding, shift scheduling, time clock management, payroll, and performance evaluation. When it comes to building the right HR tech stack for your business, it's all about prioritizing the features that will make the biggest impact. Start by considering how you currently handle everyday HR tasks, such as how people apply to your open roles or how you pay your hourly workers, and think about how new technology can enhance these processes. By investing in the right tools, you'll not only boost your productivity and save costs but also create a more empowering environment for your hourly workforce. Recruiting and hiring Among hourly workers with less than 12 months on the job, 52% are either actively or passively looking for a change . Making sure your recruiting and hiring process is quick, intuitive, and more accessible can better attract those job seekers. This is where an HR tech stack comes into play. 52% of hourly workers are looking for a job change The job search tactics of hourly workers can differ greatly from their white-collar counterparts. They’re less risk averse and willing to leave a job without having another one lined up. Working outside an office, they rely almost entirely on their phones as their main form of communication. With the right HR tech, your business can attract more applicants, perform background checks, streamline the orientation process, and get them all up to speed—ready to work from day one. When building your HR tech stack, include these tools to cover your hiring and recruiting needs: Applicant tracking systems (ATS) By offering unique ways to source applicants, an ATS is the backbone of your HR tech stack. It helps manage your overall recruiting and hiring process. Look for a platform like Workstream that can organize and screen job applications, allow applicants to schedule their own interviews, and send automated messages to applicants directly from the platform. Job posting platforms This type of HR tool helps simplify the process of posting your hourly positions to the job boards and sites you already use to recruit workers like Indeed, Monster, JobTarget, and ZipRecruiter. Background check services Whether part of an ATS or its own HR tool, this service allows you to check for criminal histories, driving records, and education/work histories of job seekers, coordinate drug screenings, and more. When integrated with your ATS, background check solutions like Checkr send background check requests automatically to applicants, moving them along in the hiring process if the results satisfy your specific requirements. Onboarding When you’re ready to turn an applicant into a new hire, onboarding and training tools are essential to providing a smooth experience from day one on. Modern onboarding tools will send offer letters to applicants via text, notify them when it’s time to complete their new hire paperwork, and make it easy to fill out forms and sign documents from their phones. Time and attendance Gone are the days of time clocks and handwritten schedules—today's hourly workplaces need modern solutions to keep up with the fast-paces demands. Time-tracking tools are no longer just a convenience; they're essential for creating order and ensuring smooth operations. For workers, a dependable time-tracking system offers peace of mind. They can easily confirm or request updates to their timesheet, ensuring their paychecks are accurate and that they're being fairly compensated for their time. It gives managers visibility into who's starting, ending, or covering shifts as planned, helping them keep the business appropriately staffed to meet demand, manage labor cost expectations, and run payroll accurately. For managers, reviewing, correcting, and approving timesheets can feel like a full-time job. It's time-consuming and can lead to errors that cost your business, especially when payroll mistakes or overtime issues arise. A reliable time-tracking system helps streamline this process, making it easier to spot and fix discrepancies before they become costly problems. Plus, it provides a clear and accurate record of breaks and overtime, helping you stay compliant with labor laws and avoid any legal headaches. Shift Scheduling No matter how good an organization or manager is at shift scheduling, it’s impossible to plan for all the unexpected situations or life events that get in the way. Employees get sick. Cars break down. Half your staff buys tickets to the same concert on the same night. When those little things prevent shifts from running smoothly, does your staff manager have to get involved to fill gaps in your schedule, or can hourly workers simply swap shifts among themselves? With the right tools in your HR tech stack, you can empower your hourly workers to swap shifts when it’s necessary, overcome scheduling conflicts, and help your business stay staffed without the stress. When setting up your HR tech stack, turn to app-based software for your shift scheduling needs: Time-tracking software Built with hourly work in mind, time-tracking software can automate all three components of time-tracking: time entry, approvals, and reporting. Instead of hourly workers manually clocking their time in and time out, it can be done electronically using software-based systems—providing convenience while also reducing inaccuracies. Besides timesheet approval and payroll processing, time tracking tools also help you better understand performance, labor cost budget, and compensation. Shift management tools Whether managing shifts at fixed locations or overseeing employees offsite, these types of software solutions enable everyone to stay current on shift details, schedule changes, and status updates. Hourly workers can swap shifts using an app, rather than having back-and-forth conversations via text messages or phone calls—all while managers still retain authority to approve or deny shift swaps. Scheduling tools For effective communication between workers at all levels at your workplace, it's critical to create and post schedules as far in advance as possible. Which is why any tech stack would benefit from the ability to inform employees about their shifts, let them confirm their availability, request time off, and let the managers adjust shifts accordingly. Payroll and benefits administration When it comes to your HR tech stack, payroll might just be the most important piece, especially if you're managing an hourly workforce. The complexities of hourly payroll—like fluctuating hours, different roles, various locations, and overtime—mean it's crucial to have a system designed to handle these challenges. Errors in payroll can be incredible costly, not just financially, but in terms of compliance and employee trust. For many hourly workers, payday is anything but predictable. They rarely get paid the same amount each time, thanks to the different hours they work, if they work different positions in the same pay period, how many locations they work at, and whether they've clocked in any overtime. This variability is the norm in hourly work, but it adds a layer of complexity to payroll that can't be ignored. Compliance is another critical factor. Making a mistake in how you handle lunch breaks, overtime, or tipping doesn't just lead to unhappy employees—it can lead to costly legal issues. Labor laws are strict, and staying on top of them is non-negotiable. Every aspect of payroll must align with these laws to avoid penalties and ensure your business is on the right side of the law. Correcting all this information every payroll run is not only time-consuming but also puts you at risk for errors, especially if you're copying and pasting data from one tool to another. That's why the most beneficial payroll solution for an hourly business is an all-in-one platform. A system that includes time tracking, shift scheduling, employee records, and more, all seamlessly integrated with payroll, helps you stay compliant, accurate, and efficient—every single payday. When selecting your HR tech stack, consider these tools for your payroll and benefits needs: Payroll software Too many hourly businesses either manage payroll by hand or use software designed to serve white collar workers with too many features they don't need and not enough of the ones they do. Look for software built for hourly that automatically flags errors, keeps your compliant, offers fast, expert support, and integrates seamlessly with your HR and time-tracking systems. Benefits enrollment and management platforms This HR technology can help a business maintain employee benefits enrollment, communication, and distribution for its hourly workforce. This is also where employees review, update, and utilize benefits or access forms and documents on a mobile device. Performance management Employee evaluations and performance management play important roles in achieving ongoing success in any workplace. But if you oversee an hourly workforce, you more than likely need a tool that is accessible on-the-go without the cluttered paper files or burdensome spreadsheets. Of course, workplace performance isn’t limited or measured by employee evaluations alone. It’s also about helping your people set goals and encouraging friendly competition to reach targets. Performance evaluation software These solutions incorporate brief questions to prompt action while keeping subjectivity or speculation to a minimum. They can provide managers with a foundation for coaching conversations, helping them better lead and grow their teams. The data you collect from this software can help inform your compensation, promotion, and succession planning decisions. And can even keep the lines of communication open via chat. Goal setting and tracking tools This HR technology is often used to inspire productivity, accelerate performance, and increase employee engagement through a combination of gamification, motivational psychology, and activity-based behaviors. Managers can set up personalized goals with metrics or implement leaderboards using progress bars and rankings to motivate teams. Employee experience In the aftermath of the Great Resignation, more businesses now recognize the value of retaining their best employees by prioritizing their professional needs, personal well being, flexible benefit options, and performance feedback. Those who don’t take care of their people risk losing them. Many among the hourly workforce feel unappreciated by their current employers. One recent survey revealed that 37% of frontline employees were considering leaving their jobs. Emotional issues like burnout were cited among the top factors negatively affecting employee experience. 37% of hourly workers are considering leaving their jobs When creating your HR tech stack, try these tools to address your employee experience needs: Communication tools Chat tools facilitate real-time communication, enabling quick responses to urgent needs and ensuring workers are informed and engaged no matter where they are. A mobile-first solution enhances real-time collaboration and ensures that important messages are delivered promptly, fostering a more efficient and cohesive work environment. Engagement survey tools Using a survey tool to collect feedback from hourly workers offers significant benefits for businesses. It allows you to continuously monitor employee satisfaction through various types of surveys, such as pulse, exit, and new hire surveys . This helps employers gather valuable insights into worker morale and engagement, ultimately reducing turnover and fostering a more positive work environment. Recognition platforms When a workforce feels both appreciated and valued, they tend to enjoy higher levels of job satisfaction. Businesses that encourage employee recognition experience reduced turnover rates and greater productivity. Recognition platforms allow workers and managers alike to recognize each other via eCards, award nominations, and other forms of positive reinforcement and company-wide acknowledgement—with any mobile device. This can include the celebration of employee birthdays as well as career anniversaries. 360 feedback systems These HR tools enable you to measure and track employee performance in key skills all through a mobile device. Managers can identify (and understand) skill gaps over time to improve team dynamics, better allocate training budgets, and adjust future hiring plans. These solutions give workers access to an open channel of communication to provide direct feedback to managers or further up the chain of command as needed. Compliance and reporting According to a study conducted at the height of the global pandemic, 65% of hourly workers say they hadn’t been provided with any additional technology to complete their jobs. An even greater number, 91%, said they wanted better training— which included safety and compliance. 65% of hourly workers don't have the tech they need to do their jobs 91% want better technology Failing to comply with company policies, procedures, and regulations could result in hefty fines for employees, owners, and businesses. But with a hourly workforce, ensuring that every employee is in compliance with the rules and requirements that govern your industry can prove challenging. Measuring, then analyzing, the productivity of your hourly workers can be just as difficult. It first starts with figuring out which specific things need to be measured. Different businesses can have different definitions of productivity. Should your KPI be the number of jobs completed in a given day, week, or month? Is response time in the field your metric? Is it customer satisfaction? Without the right tools, uncovering efficiencies to improve productivity in a timely manner can be a tedious process. Especially if your employees work independently or without direct oversight. There’s also a matter of separating actual work time from travel or administrative tasks. Some of your KPIs can be measured independently. Other KPIs require self reporting or customer input. When selecting your HR tech stack, try these tools for your compliance and reporting needs: Compliance management software This type of HR technology stores all your compliance-related information in one central location, accessible to your employees on their mobile devices—keeping them informed on current company policies and procedures. Real-time notifications about activity status (such as incomplete or delayed tasks) remind and encourage users to get in compliance. Look for solutions that integrate training directly in the tools that your workers already use. Reporting and analytics tools This software incorporates streamlined workflows and modern technologies to schedule, track, monitor, and analyze the performance of shift workers on their mobile devices as they conduct work activities—giving you a clear, real-time view of day-to-day operations. This can take the form of customized mobile timesheets, work-related app- or site-usage monitoring, GPS tracking, or daily check-in prompts, often compiled into a visual timeline. Learning management system Traditional training platforms for the workplace are designed for office-bound or centrally located employees. The needs of the hourly workforce are obviously different. On the road or on the job, hourly workers are always on the move. Pulling them off the frontline to train in a classroom or behind a desk is costly and impractical. Yet, your workers crave more education (as evidenced in the previous section by their desire for career advancement). Or need corporate or compliance-based training. With hourly workers, employers and HR managers must find ways to offer training that can be completed anywhere —with all the information they need—without slowing them down at work. When setting up your HR tech stack, use app-based tools for your learning management needs: Digital training tools/programs Look for tools that break up training in short, to-the-point units instead of hour-plus presentations. When critical or time-sensitive information becomes available, some software solutions can send notifications via text to every employee’s mobile device for added efficiency, rather than waiting until everyone is in the same room to get up-to-date about courses. How you build your tech stack matters 52% of hourly workers claim they would leave their jobs over tech tools. They expect and deserve the same quality experience with HR technology as their white-collar counterparts. 52% of hourly workers would leave their jobs over tech tools Putting together a solid HR tech stack for an hourly workforce takes time, effort, and research. But it doesn’t have to happen all at once. Whether it’s the lack of mobile-friendly payroll options for your employees, the need for flexible and accessible shift scheduling, or a gap in compliance training, identify and focus on which HR tools fit your biggest priorities. Know that once the implementation is complete, it will be rewarding and well worth the effort for many reasons. Your HR tech stack can help improve the worker experience, increase overall job satisfaction, and decrease turnover rates—making it that much easier to manage your business.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 08/29/19 How Automation is Transforming Companies Share this article When talking about robotic process automation, or RPA, we usually associate it with images of robots (think - I, Robot) and how they will take over our world in the future. Well, fret not, RPAs are not designed to control our world but instead, use AI to make it a lot better by automating routine tasks that used to consume an employee’s time. With RPAs, there are many concerns about how these ‘robots’ will replace a lot of jobs, leaving potentially a lot of people unemployed. But according to a recent Harvard Business Review article , \"The right question isn't which jobs are going to be replaced, but rather, what work will be redefined, and how?\". Such automations provide individuals with opportunities to upskill and focus on tasks that require more human interactions. Currently, many industries are turning to RPAs to streamline their operations or merely improve their business processes. This includes the automotive and HR industry and even essential services providers like the fire department . For example, companies like Tesla are constantly developing their concept of an automated car where one no longer needs to drive to get to their destination. At the same time, almost 40% of companies are using AI in the HR department alone. And the numbers across various industries are increasing! With such developments, how are RPAs transforming organizations for the better? And most importantly, will employees such as hourly workers be out of jobs after their routined tasks get automated? Let’s find out. Automation in the Hourly Workspace Aside from the industries mentioned above, RPAs are used in the restaurant, retail and logistics sectors as well. These are also lines of business that hire hourly workers due to the nature of their operations. Undoubtedly, the use of robots has made operations much more efficient. From an automated inventory management system to cooking robots, RPAs have helped in the streamlining of business processes. This also means that employees are able to provide better customer service . In the case of the restaurant industry, this can range from offering extra napkins to customers or just asking them how their food is to provide them a better restaurant experience. The world has come very far in terms of technological advancements and the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated the use of technology in industries. Case in point - there was a 5.2% increase in robot unit orders by restaurants in North America in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the year before. Due to the outbreak, many have turned to cooking robots to prepare kitchens that can minimize the spread of viruses. Brain Corp, an autonomous mobile robots provider, also saw an increase of 300% in robotic deployments in 2020, most of them in retail stores. These robots are mostly used to scan shelves for items that are out-of-stock and to pick up orders for customers. It is important to note that it is not only jobs in-store that can benefit from RPAs. Even hiring processes such as the screening of candidates . scheduling of interviews and onboarding of employees could be automated. Workstream provides just that with the use of AI to ensure that companies are able to streamline the hiring process of their hourly workers. These automated processes have proven to reduce their time-to-hire by about 70%. One thing's for sure, the use of robots across various industries is unlikely to dwindle due to the advantages they bring. Automation Enhances Jobs, Not Eliminate Them Putting it simply, RPA involves the production of automation with the use of software. It automates routine administrative tasks that entail high volume and low complexity . According to Forrester, automation will replace 12 million jobs in the US by 2025. The forecast found that the jobs most likely to be disrupted by automation will be roles in the warehouse, administration, and customer service, including cashiers. Why is this so? Because these jobs are highly repetitive and involve processes that are easily duplicated by a machine. But as with other types of technology that replace human hands-on jobs like auto assembly and the sorting of Amazon packages, RPAs will create other kinds of work while streamlining redundant processes. Of course, someone will have to monitor the robots. Automation specialists will also be needed as well as data scientists, content curators, and more. As in the case of Workstream, hiring managers are able to focus on the performance of their businesses since they can leave most of the hiring to the automations set up by Wokstream’s hiring specialists. Moreover, the jobs replaced by RPAs in the hourly workspace are usually those that have a high turnover rate due to the mundane nature of the tasks. By automating them, employees will be given a chance to hone their skills for high-value jobs. In the retail sector, for example, their time could be used to interact with customers to tell them more about a certain product rather than to look high and low for items in the store. Not only will this improve the company’s brand image and personality, but also boost sales for the outlet. Essentially, robots can replace repetitive tasks. However, it is hard to create an authentic human touch through them. Embracing the Future Automation is still in the pilot stage for many industries and particularly so for hourly worker positions. Fear is typically the result of the unknown. And, rightfully so, some will question, \"Will RPA take my job away? Is management out to replace me with a Jetsons character?\". But history has shown that RPAs have improved efficiency while maintaining employment for hourly workers. And as evidence suggests, completely replacing humans with robots will unlikely achieve better results due to the lack of human touch. RPAs are definitely here to stay to provide competitive advantages for daring business leaders who are willing to take the leap to automation. So if you ask us whether robots and automation will replace hourly workers, our answer remains - they only enhance them, not eliminate them.

This could not be further from the truth. The reality is the onboarding process has only just begun and companies that fail to onboard new hires effectively will leave themselves at risk of losing great talent and be left with a serious turnover problem. A great way to mitigate against a chaotic and ineffective onboarding process is by building clear, repeatable onboarding templates that you can use repeatedly. Here are 5 templates you can use to perfect your onboarding experience . What to include in your onboarding templates? There are several key things that should be included in any new employee onboarding template to ensure that the new employee has a positive first impression and a successful experience day one . These include: Introduction to the team members : The new employee should be introduced to their team and the broader company. This could include a welcome message from the CEO or a tour of the office. Review of company policies and procedures: The new employee should be provided with information about the company's policies and procedures, including things like dress code , work hours, and expectations for performance. Onboarding paperwork: The new employee should be provided with any necessary paperwork to complete during the onboarding process . This could include forms for benefits, tax withholding, and other important information. Training on company systems and processes: The new employee should receive training on the company's systems and processes throughout the first week and maybe even the first month . This should include things like how to use the company's software and how to access important information. Performance evaluation: The new employee should be evaluated on their performance during the onboarding process . This could include feedback from their manager and colleagues, as well as a review of their progress and goals. Gantt chart onboarding templates This template is a visual representation of the tasks and timeline for onboarding a new employee . It allows the team to see the entire process and track progress. An example of what the template could look like: Gantt chart (for an IT technician) Introduce new IT technician to team 1/1/2022 1/1/2022 1 day Set up computer and equipment 1/2/2022 1/2/2022 1 day Review company policies 1/3/2022 1/4/2022 2 days Complete onboarding paperwork 1/5/2022 1/5/2022 1 day Training on company systems 1/6/2022 1/10/2022 5 days The Gantt chart is a useful tool for organizing and tracking the onboarding process . It allows the team to see the tasks that need to be completed and the timeline for completing them. This ensures that the new employee is getting all the necessary information and support to be successful in their new role . This kind of template also allows the team to identify potential bottlenecks or issues with the onboarding process . For example, if the training on company systems is scheduled for the end of the onboarding process , the team may want to adjust the timeline to allow more time for this important task. Checklist onboarding templates This onboarding checklist template is a list of tasks that need to be completed during the onboarding process . It ensures that nothing is missed and allows the new employee to track their own progress. An example of what the template could look like: Checklist (for a customer service rep) Introduce new customer service rep to team Set up computer and equipment Review company policies and procedures Complete onboarding paperwork Training on customer service techniques and systems A checklist is a simple but effective way to manage the onboarding process . It allows the team to identify all the tasks that need to be completed and ensure that nothing is missed. This is especially important for complex onboarding processes with many different tasks and stakeholders . The checklist also gives the new employee a better sense of tracking progress. Each task completed can be checked off and archived so there are no loose ends hanging around. Milestones onboarding templates This template outlines key milestones during the onboarding process . It allows the team to focus on the most important aspects of onboarding and ensure that the new employee is progressing on schedule. An example of what the template could look like: Milestones (for a marketing executive) Day 1: Introduce new marketing executive to team (if virtual, a welcome email works great) Day 3: Review company policies and procedures Day 5: Complete onboarding paperwork Week 2: Training on marketing techniques and systems Month 1: Performance evaluation Milestones are important markers in the onboarding process . They provide a clear and concise way to check-in on progress and ensure that the new employee is meeting the necessary goals and expectations. This is especially important for long onboarding processes with many different tasks and stakeholders . Orientation schedule onboarding templates This template is a detailed schedule for the first few days of the onboarding process . It helps the new employee understand what to expect and plan their time accordingly for their new job . An example of what the template could look like: Orientation schedule (for an HR employee) Day 1: 9:00 AM: Welcome and introduction to team 10:00 AM: Tour of office 11:00 AM: Review of company policies 12:00 PM: Lunch with team 1:00 PM: Set up computer and equipment 2:00 PM: Review of onboarding paperwork Day 2: 9:00 AM: Training on HR policies and procedures 10:00 AM: Meet with manager to discuss goals and expectations 11:00 AM: Review of company benefits 12:00 PM: Lunch with team 1:00 PM: Training on HR policies and procedures (continued) An orientation schedule provides a clear and organized structure for the onboarding process . It allows the new employee to know what to expect on each day of their orientation, which can help reduce anxiety and stress. It also helps the team to plan and coordinate the various tasks and activities involved in the onboarding process . The orientation schedule is highly regimented which can be useful for entry level starters who aren’t yet comfortable with the expectations of your business environment. The clear guidance can be seen as hand holding for more senior starters so it probably wouldn’t be the best fit for them. New employee packet onboarding templates This new hire onboarding template is a packet of information that is given to the new employee on their first day . It contains all the necessary information and documents they will need during the onboarding process . An example of what the template could look like: New employee packet (for a marketing executive) Welcome letter from the CEO Company policies and procedures Employee handbook Onboarding paperwork Company benefits information Training schedule List of contacts for HR, marketing, and other departments Map of the office and parking instructions Company culture guide A new employee packet is a valuable tool for providing the new employee with all the necessary information and documents they will need during their onboarding process . It allows the team to provide the new employee with a comprehensive overview of the company and their new role . The new employee packet should be carefully designed and organized. It should include all the necessary information and documents, but it should also be easy to understand and navigate. While it provides plenty of information, it’s not overly structured and allows the new starter to tackle their orientation at their own pace. This can be useful when the job role is flexible or not fully defined. Summary Employee onboarding templates are so important in ensuring that the onboarding process is consistent and the workflow is efficient. Having a clear process means you aren’t leaving anything up to chance and these 5 templates are hopefully a good starting point for you to build your ideal template. Ultimately, any onboarding plan templates will need to be tweaked and adjusted to match your systems, so it’s important to measure what works best for your business.

Share this article As the way we work continues to evolve, so too does the way we need to manage our workforce. Human Capital Management (HCM) refers to the process of workforce management. HCM software has been used to help businesses get the most out of their workforce. This post will answer the question of what human capital management is while also discussing the benefits HCM can have for your business. What is HCM? Human Capital Management (HCM) is a term that refers to the process of managing an organization's workforce. This includes activities such as recruiting new employees, onboarding them, training them, and managing their performance. To manage an organization's human capital effectively, businesses can implement a Human Capital Management software solution. What are the elements of Human Capital Management? There are many Human Capital Management jobs out there due to how many elements there are within Human Capital Management. Several of these elements include: Recruiting The process of sourcing and hiring new employees is one of the key elements of Human Capital Management. This involves using a variety of methods to source potential candidates, such as posting job listings, leveraging recruiting agencies, or promoting roles on social media platforms. Onboarding Once a new employee has been hired, it’s important to onboard them properly. This includes providing them with information about their role and the company, helping them get up to speed with company policies and procedures, and collecting onboarding documents. Training For employees to be effective in their roles, it’s important to provide them with the necessary training. This can include on-the-job training, online courses, or even attending workshops or conferences. Managing performance It’s essential to regularly review an employee's performance and provide feedback so they can continue to improve their work output. This may involve setting goals and targets, providing coaching and mentoring, or issuing warnings or sanctions if needed. Benefits A key part of retaining employees is offering competitive benefits and retirement packages. This may include things like healthcare insurance, pension plans, paid vacation days, or tuition reimbursement programs. Payroll Managing pay is a similar but distinct element to benefits. This includes issuing payments on time, calculating taxes and deductions, and keeping track of employee hours worked. Employee relations Maintaining positive employee relations is essential for keeping morale high and preventing turnover. This can be achieved through a variety of methods, such as regular communication, social events, or providing support during difficult times. Compliance It’s important to ensure that all employees are compliant with company policies and procedures, as well as any applicable laws and regulations. This may involve conducting audits or investigations, issuing warnings or sanctions, or providing training on compliance-related topics. Time and attendance Tracking employee time and attendance is important for a few reasons, such as managing payroll or identifying areas where employees may be slacking off. This can be done through manual methods, such as timecards or sign-in sheets, or by using an automated time and attendance system. What is the difference between Human Capital Management and Human Resource Management? While many make the mistake of using these two terms as synonyms, the reality is that there are distinctions between the two. Human Resource Management, or HRM, is a term that refers to the process of managing an organization's employees. This includes activities such as recruitment, selection, training, and performance management. Human Capital Management, on the other hand, refers to the process of managing an organization's workforce over the entire employee lifecycle. This includes activities such as recruiting new employees, onboarding them, training them, and managing their performance. Why is HCM important? HCM provides an all-encompassing approach that can benefit your business in several ways. Firstly, it helps businesses to attract and retain the best people. By implementing an HCM solution, businesses can identify and hire the most talented individuals who fit with their organizational culture. Secondly, HCM can help businesses improve employee productivity. By providing employees with the necessary training and tools, businesses can ensure they are able to perform to their full potential. Finally, HCM can help businesses to reduce costs associated with employee turnover. As a strategy, HCM brings all these ideas together in a highly integrated manner. A human capital management strategy will keep things organized and efficient and ultimate save time and money. What is HCM software? The workplace has never been as dynamic or fast-paced as it is today, and organizations are under increasing pressure to do more with less. Human Capital Management software helps businesses manage their workforce more effectively and efficiently. HCM software solutions are designed to automate and streamline the process of managing an organization's human capital. This includes activities such as recruiting, onboarding, training, and performance management. By automating these processes, businesses can save time and resources that can be better spent on other areas of the business. Recruiting The recruiting process is the beginning of the employee lifecycle, and it’s critical that businesses get it right. HCM software can automate the process of recruiting by helping businesses identify and hire the most qualified individuals who fit their organizational culture. HCM software can also automate the process of applicant tracking. This includes tracking applicants through the entire recruitment process from the initial application to the offer stage. This helps businesses to keep track of all applicants and make better decisions about who to hire. Onboarding Onboarding is the process of welcoming new employees into an organization and providing them with the necessary training and tools to be productive. HCM software can automate the onboarding process by creating custom onboarding plans for each employee. This includes collecting documents like I-9s, assigning tasks, and sending welcome packets. By automating these tasks, businesses can ensure that new employees are properly onboarded and ready to start working as soon as possible. Training Businesses need to provide employees with the necessary training to be productive. HCM software can automate the training process by creating custom training plans for each employee. This includes sending reminder emails, tracking employee progress, and generating reports on employee performance. By automating these tasks, businesses can ensure that employees are properly trained and able to work productively from day one. Performance management Performance management is a key component of Human Capital Management. HCM software can automate the performance management process by creating custom performance reviews for each employee. This includes setting goals, tracking progress, and generating reports on employee performance. By automating these tasks, businesses can ensure employees are meeting their performance goals and are able to improve their performance over time. Benefits of HCM solutions The best human capital management software has a plethora of benefits. Here are just some of the benefits your business could reap by implementing HCM software: Make data-driven solutions You no longer need to rely on gut instinct when making decisions about your workforce. HCM software provides you with the data and analytics you need to make informed decisions about your employees. This data can be used to improve the performance of your workforce and make better decisions about things like training and development. Reduce time and resources spent on HR By automating the process of managing your workforce, HCM software can save you a significant amount of time and resources, allowing you to focus on other areas of your business. Improved employee engagement When employees are properly managed and developed, they’re more engaged with their work. This leads to improved performance and productivity. Reduce employee turnover When employees are properly managed and developed, they are less likely to leave the organization. This helps to reduce the costs associated with employee turnover. Increase profitability By eliminating waste and improving the performance of your workforce, HCM software can help you increase your profitability. Improved customer satisfaction Happy employees lead to improved customer satisfaction. When your employees are properly managed and developed, they are more likely to be satisfied with their work and provide better service to your customers. Challenges of HCM While there are many benefits to implementing an HCM solution, there are also some challenges that businesses need to be aware of. Data security HCM solutions store a lot of sensitive employee data including personal information, financial information, and health records. Businesses must choose an HCM solution that is built on a secure platform and has strong data security measures in place. Data accuracy HCM solutions need to be able to accurately track employee data. This includes things like job titles, salary history, performance reviews, and training records. If the data in an HCM solution is inaccurate, it can lead to problems with decision-making, compliance, and employee morale. User adoption HCM solutions can be complex, and it can be difficult for employees to use all the features. Businesses must choose an HCM solution that’s easy to use and has a robust training and support infrastructure in place. Human Capital Management in the cloud There has been a wholesale shift towards cloud-based software and HCM solutions are no exception. Cloud-based HCM solutions offer a number of benefits when compared to traditional on-premise solutions. Some of the main benefits of cloud-based HCM solutions include: Reduced costs Cloud-based HCM solutions are typically more cost-effective than traditional on-premise solutions. This is because businesses don’t need to invest in the hardware and software required to run the solution. Increased flexibility Cloud-based HCM solutions offer businesses increased flexibility as they can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. This is particularly beneficial for businesses with employees who work remotely or in different locations. Scalability Cloud-based HCM solutions are highly scalable and can be easily adjusted to meet the changing needs of businesses. This contrasts with traditional on-premise solutions which can be difficult and expensive to scale. Improved security Cloud-based HCM solutions offer businesses improved security as they are typically hosted by experienced providers who have invested heavily in security infrastructure. The history of HCM In the 1950s, the concept of Human Capital Management first began to emerge. As the nature of work began to evolve, so too did the way we thought about employees. Thanks to advancements in computing and automation, employees were no longer viewed as cogs in a machine or steps in an assembly line. These advancements gave way to the rise of a new class of worker: the knowledge worker. Unlike their predecessors, these employees would provide a whole new level of value to a business as they were able to create, innovate, and think critically. It was this change in the workforce that led to the development of Human Capital Management to manage and motivate these new employees. In its simplest form, HCM can be defined as a process that helps businesses to get the most out of their employees. Fast forward to today and there are many different careers that come out of Human Capital Management. Whether it's in Human Capital Management consulting or in HCM strategy, there are many opportunities to have a long career in this field. The future of HCM Human Capital Management has evolved a great deal since its 20th-century roots. As the workplace changes, so too do the need to evolve the way this new workforce is managed. Here are some of the ways we can expect HCM to evolve in the future: Mobile To truly engage modern workers, HR needs to take a mobile-first approach. This means that HCM solutions need to be accessible on the go via mobile devices. Predictive analytics The use of data and analytics will become increasingly important in the world of HCM. By using predictive analytics, businesses will be able to identify issues and trends before they become problems. This will allow HR leaders to take a proactive approach to employee management and avoid potential crises. Artificial intelligence The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is also likely to increase in the world of HCM. AI can be used for a variety of tasks such as identifying training and development needs, predicting employee turnover, and automating HR processes. But AI will also be important on a more rudimentary level. Things like chatbots will become ever more popular to service a much faster-paced work environment. In a world where we're always 'on,' it's important to have solutions that can keep up. Social Finally, businesses need to recognize that the digital world largely exists on social platforms. Embracing this change can allow for better engagement between workers and the company while also allowing easier lines of communication between employees too. Summary Human Capital Management is all about getting the most out of your employees. Businesses that implement a clear HCM strategy can expect to see several benefits such as improved employee engagement, increased productivity, and reduced turnover. Just remember that, like the workforce itself, HCM always needs to evolve to ensure that it's relevant and effective.

So it comes to no surprise that most people turn to the internet when it is time to find a job. Up to 86% of candidates with a smartphone use it as the foundational tool for a job search. These days, new positions are made easily available on job boards like Craigslist and Indeed.com . Are you making a move to implement a new online recruiting campaign, or intending to improve the strategies that are already in place? If you are, you can save time and money by using the techniques that are working in the current industry. Here are a few tips to help you get started: Tip #1: Cater to Tech-Savvy Job Searchers Even entry-level hourly workers have smartphones and an internet connection. People look online for employment information and to research employers. You need to make sure that you are publishing the right information online so that more candidates will be inclined to visit your website. Recent studies show that candidates tend to favor businesses with good wages and benefits, as well as opportunities for advancement. When someone starts in an entry-level position, they want the chance to move up to management in the future. So, your description needs to entice the qualified.Include dates with details about benefits and advancement opportunities in the future. Job titles need to be attention-grabbing, and the descriptions should be engaging. Include keywords that will increase the chances of your job post appearing in search results. At the same time, don't skip details that are necessary for the candidate to know, such as required skills, wage range, job duties, benefits, and more. Tip #2: Build a Database and Leverage Your List Creating an online list of potential candidates can be a powerful way to speed up the process of hiring in the future. For example, you might post a job opening and hire two people out of 150 applications that were received. Even though you turned away 148 people, it doesn't mean that they won't be the right fit when the position opens up again. Invite qualified candidates to join a notification list so that they can stay updated about new job opportunities when they are available. By doing so, you have a warm market that can be used in the future when turnover happens. Tip #3: Create a Digital Brand and Voice It is essential to ensure that you are consistent with branding and voicing on every piece of content that is published for your recruiting efforts. Creating a digital brand is a way to make your company memorable for potential applicants. At the same time, you can use the content to communicate the company culture and values that can be expected. For example, if you are looking to develop a flexible and fun work environment, then your job descriptions shouldn't be dry and boring. Instead, infuse the online messages with a little bit of personality that highlights the attitude you are hoping to cultivate in the office. Doing this will also let candidates know a bit more about your company culture before they are hired into your organization. Thus, they will be able to start working with the right attitude that contributes to your team. Tip #4: Empower Employees to Refer Their Friends Tap into your network of employees to bring in qualified candidates for job openings. Share details with your current workforce when jobs are available. Always include information about referral links and where prospective candidates need to go should they want to apply. Creating a positive company culture increases employee satisfaction, which then increases the likelihood that your current employees will provide the organization with good referrals. Employees often write about their experience on social media or review sites, like Glassdoor, and these reviews can affect how the new hires see your company. When it comes to recruiting, you need to be sure that you are supporting your current staff well in order to attract quality candidates for your job openings. Tip #5: Automate Your Hiring Processes It is tedious work to create a job description and post it across multiple job boards. There's no reason why you should be stuck handling this mundane and tedious work when there are ways to automate the process. At Workstream, we offer a system that gives you an all-in-one dashboard , making it easier for you to manage your hiring.

The virus now affects hundreds of thousands of people on virtually every continent. With countries, states, and cities going into lockdown, markets and business are taking a major hit, causing concern particularly for small and medium-sized (SMB) owners everywhere. “Small businesses are vital economic engines in every community and state, and they have helped make our economy the strongest in the world.” - Jovita Carranza, SBA Administrator In the United States alone, there are around 30 million small businesses , all of which are in danger of experiencing setbacks brought on by the coronavirus pandemic . To help those in this sector, hours after WHO’s announcement, President Donald Trump declared that SMBs be provided an additional $50 billion in loans federally guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza shares, “ Our Agency will work directly with state Governors to provide targeted, low-interest disaster recovery loans to small businesses that have been severely impacted by the situation.” Once an impacted state or territory puts forward a request to the SBA and is approved, the agency will issue an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) declaration. SMBs and private, non-profit organizations in the region under this declaration will be able to avail of loans of up to $2 million, which can be used to help pay off accounts payable, payroll, sick leave for afflicted employees, alternative supply chain expenses, and other operating costs. To be eligible for a loan, you must first be unable to secure funding elsewhere. The business must also be “ unable to meet its obligations and to pay its ordinary and necessary operating expenses .” The interest rate for EIDL loans are fixed at 3.75% for SMBs and 2.75% for non-profits. Terms of payment can be extended to up to 30 years on a case-to-case basis, after the SBA reviews the borrower’s ability to pay. For more details, SMB owners may contact the SBA disaster assistance customer service center via these methods: Call 1-800-659-2955 (TTY: 1-800-877-8339) E-mail disastercustomerservice@sba.gov “This is not a financial crisis.This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world.” - President Donald Trump Best  Alternative Loan Options If your business is not eligible for the EIDL loan, or if your state or county has yet been approved for this funding, rest assured that there are other options available to you. Here’s a round-up of other loan options and how they work: BlueVine is good for borrowers with FICO scores as low as 530. Who’s eligible: Businesses that have been operational for 6 months, with a minimum annual revenue of $100,000. Loan range : From $5,000 up to $5,000,000.

According to the latest jobs report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the restaurant industry benefited from gaining over half a million jobs , of the 1.8 million total jobs recovered in July. It's a welcome sign-of-life for the industry, despite job growth being slower overall compare to previous months due to rolled-back openings in many cities and states. But the future of the recovery rests on a few frustratingly unclear items. One, what financial support will Congress give to businesses and employees ? While President Trump signed executive orders to potentially provide extra unemployment, there has been no movement on the proposed Heroes Act or the RESTAURANTS Act (The Real Economic Support That Acknowledges Unique Restaurant Assistance Needed to Survive; a fantastic backronym). Considering the PPP saved 2.3 million jobs , businesses are looking for another economic boost to stay in business and retain employees. The RESTAURANTS Act that calls for $120 billion in grants could be crucial to the survival of many independent locations. Two, when will businesses have access to adequate COVID-19 testing ? No country has a cure for the virus, yet many have reopened due to quick and plentiful testing. The US is unfortunately lagging far behind . Imagine, having a 30 minute wait for a table and using that time to take a COVID-19 test and getting back the results. It would be a game changer for restaurants and other businesses trying to fully reopen. And three, when will the pandemic end ? No guesses here. July gave the restaurant industry some positive signs of recovery. Let's hope August is even better. A restaurant by any other name... Innovation and adaptation have always been the keys to the longevity of bars and restaurants, and now owners are getting creative with even the very definition of what a \"restaurant\" is. In Texas, for example, Gov. Greg Abbott aimed to shut down bars by targeting any location where alcohol sales exceeded 51% of total revenue. Unfortunately, this inadvertently forced many places to shut down even though, as steak houses or coffee shops that sell wine, they weren't actually bars. It's almost as if the food services industry is as nuanced and varied as they come. Hence, many got creative . One owner \"updated his sales numbers to include live music ticket sales from concerts,\" which brought his alcohol revenue down to 39% of total revenue . Others bar owners are scrambling to get their Food and Beverage Certificates to reclassify themselves as restaurants in order to stay open, even using future sales projections as evidence. While these sorts of changes can be impossible for some stores, it shows that savvy bar and restaurant owners are pivoting to survive, and even thrive, during the pandemic. It's inspiring to witness, and could spark a massive revolution in how the industry operates in the future. Is it a bar? Is it a restaurant? Does it really matter as long as it's open? Are delivery apps worth it? Many say no. If you're an owner that has been muttering obscenities at Postmates or UberEats under your breath, you're not alone. The LAist has a good article on the frustratingly high commissions that restaurants are paying to be included in these delivery apps. How high? Some command as much as 30% commission fees. Are these apps adding chives to the meals or something?? It can often be a catch-22 with these apps: don't join and risk the app-loving public never finding your establishment, or use them and potentially have slim or even non-existent margins on deliveries. Many would even lose money on every delivery. Many cities have started capping delivery app fees to 15%, which can help make it more feasible, but that still may not be low enough for some. And there is anecdotal evidence that these apps are charging more than 15% where they can get away with it. Do these apps cause more harm than good to independent restaurants? Let us know if you feel that way. In Other News... Pandemic-proofing your hiring process. Everyday, we hear stories of business owners and hiring managers having to pivot away from how they used to hire for their companies due to the ongoing pandemic. Methodologies have changed including how they screen candidates and how they conduct interviews, all the way to the onboarding process of new hires. It seems like the best practices of hiring during COVID-19 may be the best practices of hiring for the foreseeable future. Because of this, it's important to pandemic-proof your hiring process . Because, in a very tangible way, it's future-proofing your hiring process as well . Keep it virtual If the closing, re-opening, and re-closing of businesses have shown us anything, it's that no one can say when the rules of social distancing will truly be relaxed. Despite the potential vaccines on the horizon, studies show that they would have to be nearly 80% effective before we can start shaking hands without worry again. To put that in perspective, the flu vaccine ranges from 20% to 60% effective in any given season. This is why companies need to fully embrace virtual interviews during their hiring process and invest in the software and hardware to facilitate this interaction. Like it or not (and many do indeed like it!), this is the way hiring interviews will have to be conducted. Having the ability to easily set up virtual meetings, with seamless integration of clear and lag-free audio & visual communication, and keeping track of the video footage will all be essential to the new way of hiring. Screen faster, screen better Unemployment will continue to be high in the US through the rest of this year, and probably into 2021. During times of recession and high unemployment, it can be incredibly difficult to manually sort through the amount of job applications that come in for any given posting. While having a slew of qualified candidates may seem like an ideal scenario, it can be a nightmare for hiring managers who have a constant need to fill positions, such as in the food service industry . Again, the fire hose of job applicants won't calm down any time soon. It's more important than ever before to have an automated and intelligent screening process to immediately weeds out the bad candidates. Don't have a truck driving license when one is required? Can't work nights? Can't lift 50lbs? These types of criteria should be auto-filtered in order to save you the headache of sifting through them manually. Hire too slow and the best candidates will get snatched up before you even get to them. While the applicant pool will be large for the foreseeable future, that doesn't mean true talent is unlimited. Prepare for rapid turnover A reality of the pandemic is that workers will get sick and will need to be quickly replaced as they recover and quarantine themselves. This means businesses should expect to have to hire extremely quickly , and also hire temporary workers . This is especially important for retail positions that can't be helped but come into contact with many customers. Because of this, we anticipate that very efficient hiring flows will become standardized across most businesses. Sourcing, screening, assessing, interviewing, and onboarding will all have to be streamlined for maximum speed in order to cope with high turnover due to illness. The more all this can be automated, the less business will suffer from lower productivity. Finding and training temp employees can be integrated into this process, with video lessons and automated paperwork. Having the flow already in place can help businesses keep running throughout the rest of the pandemic without a hitch. Need help hiring the right people? Workstream can help.

While owning a restaurant still requires a lot of time, effort, and resources, there are innovative and modern tools that can help restaurant owners improve the way they do business. From food menus and food management to hiring employees and managing reservation platforms, digital records, and online ordering , modern and advanced technologies will help you stay competitive or even beat your competition if you put a little mind to it. Since you're only as good as you really want to be, using these small but extremely useful tech tools will draw more guests to your restaurant as well as higher quality employees. In this modern age of full digitalization, it's almost impossible to avoid technology, especially if you're trying to run a business. In fact, technology-based tools are exactly what gives you leverage and helps you stay relevant when competing with big companies . It's your way to do more with less and make the best out of what you have at your disposal. Therefore, it goes without saying that it's recommended to use any tool you can to stay ahead of your competition. Use an Automated Hiring Platform You can't run a restaurant without hiring some people to work for you and manage the necessary duties on a daily basis. Your restaurant is as successful as your employees are skilled. Instead of wasting your time going through countless resumes and doing meaningless interviews, you can rely on an automated hiring platform like Workstream to do it for you. Using a trusted hiring platform, you can find the right people for the job, maintain communication with numerous candidates across multiple communication channels, and track your performance whenever it's necessary. Get the most effective hiring software that will help you hire hourly workers much faster. With this useful tool, you can process job applications much faster and reach the best candidates in a timely manner. Reservation Technology People used to go to restaurants to make their reservations. Then, they used their phones, emails and so on. Just like any other technology evolves and advances, so does reservation technology. People like the notion that they can reserve a table for two or the whole family with a few clicks of a button. When you add the fact that almost everyone uses smartphones today, it isn't hard to figure out what you have to do. A digital reservation tool like Resy will help you make the most out of your restaurant without a single person walking in or giving you a call. Your guests can use this tool to browse open reservation times. Easy to customize and update, you can personalize and optimize the time people spend in your restaurant to provide them with the best guest experience that will exceed their expectations. The best thing about this technology is that you can promote it online, on your website, and even educate your guests using simple chat-bots to make their reservation efforts more efficient. As more and more people start using your electronic reservations, you'll enjoy the benefits of this technology through increased returns. Digital Record Managing books and keeping track of all records can really be a tough job but it's necessary as a lot depends on it. Therefore, it's safe to assume that this is where a restaurant owner can also count on modern technology to make things easier and more manageable. Your competition certainly uses digitized record keeping so, if you want to gain some leverage but also enhance and upgrade the way you're conducting your restaurant business, this useful tech tool might be the answer to all your record keeping troubles. First of all, once you go digital, you will always have a back-up so no risk of losing track of your records. Then, these are easier to store and search while they're also a much more efficient way of controlling all information regarding your business. It'll help you improve your productivity and increase the overall efficiency of your business. Online Ordering In the world of restaurant businesses, the latest trend is online ordering aside from using smartphones and tablets to do reservations. If you're looking for the most effective tools that will change your game for the better and make you highly competitive, an online ordering tool is exactly what you need. Such a tool won't only make you more efficient but it can directly boost your revenue significantly as guests simply love restaurants who offer them a personalized customer service and a special guest experience. The best thing about online ordering is that it creates a whole new revenue system for your restaurant and it increases the amount of work you have. Delivery and online take-outs are excellent ways to get some additional revenue that will help you improve the score of your restaurant. Since online ordering tools are highly customizable, you can optimize, personalize and customize them any way you see fit. That way, you improve communication with your guests and customers and provide a more personalized customer service. With the help of modern technology, you'll be able to fully organize your restaurant in order to improve efficiency and productivity as well as your service. While the competition may be fierce today, these useful tools will help you remain competent.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter 03/15/22 The local strategy for your global brand franchise Share this article Alex Rinna always says she was born into Popeye’s. She grew up knowing fast food, because her dad worked on both the corporate and franchise side of the chicken chain. She’s now a franchisee of 16 locations in the Southeast with Rinna Restaurant Group, but she wasn’t born into that kind of leadership—she learned it by working at Popeye’s from the ground up, and has expanded it by keeping her focus local. “When I first joined the company, my goal was for people to look at us as a local restaurant and not a big brand restaurant,” Alex says. “I think it's very hard to distinguish between the two.” Besides opening several new Popeye’s locations, Alex is also on the company’s International Franchise Association Marketing Committee, where she helps build successful marketing calendars to create new competitive assets. Yet some of her biggest advice to franchisees is to lean into the local community rather than relying solely on corporate strategies. For all that most QSR corporations do to support and structure franchises, they don’t typically tell you how to get involved in your local community. Doing so is the franchisee’s own choice. “It’s a very smart business choice,” Alex says. “But it’s the franchisee doing it themselves, so it’s very authentic. It’s not because we have a checklist. It’s because we truly just want to give back, show our appreciation and gain new customers . We want to be a great part of the community.” In fact, Alex calls those three bolded terms her pillars for building a franchise strategy as a local business sporting a global brand. In this interview, she highlights those three interconnected approaches and digs into how franchisees can budget wisely and maximize their impact—whether they’re an established presence or just getting started. The three pillars for local franchisees Giving back : “My parents have always taught me to give back,” Alex says. “We’re blessed to even have the option to provide food for organizations, charities and businesses if they’re in need.” Just the act of sharing meals can make a significant impact on a community—and Alex sees that it builds lasting relationships, too. “They’ll always come back,” she says. “And it’s not like they ever take advantage of us. I see these people in our stores constantly.” Showing appreciation : Alex points out that a lot of businesses miss out on opportunities to show appreciation to the community. Feeding teachers on Teacher Appreciation Week? Offering food to local law enforcement? Giving free meal coupons to kids who make good grades? These bits here and there will put a smile on someone’s face and show them that you truly care. Reaching new customers : At the end of the day, your business is just that—a business. So Alex recognizes that the best way to remain an active member of the community is to keep bringing in new customers. And there are always new customers, even when you fly a big-name flag. “The amount of people who have still never tried Popeye’s is insane,” she says. “When you add in third-party delivery apps, you reach a whole new audience. When we added in the famous chicken sandwich, we reached a whole group that had never tried bone-in chicken. And then, local store marketing reaches out to your local audience who has never walked in.” Of course, the ways Alex recommends for reaching new local customers are largely the first two pillars: giving back and showing appreciation inevitably reach new customers. When she provides a local football team a free pregame meal, for instance, the odds are that not all 200 players have eaten at her restaurant before. “I get to provide them a meal, show them that Popeye’s is rooting for them and hopefully gain some loyal customers in the end,” she says. Maximize your effect We all work under the constraints of budgets and time, and it’s impossible to take hold of every single opportunity to give back, show appreciation and reach new customers. You have to pick and choose from those pillars based on what is most beneficial for your business. Which is hard! Alex admits she has a hard time saying no when someone calls to ask about a donation of food. She has a much easier time saying no to advertising—because she feels that her pillars are a much more satisfactory (and effective) means of building her business in the community. “With ads, there’s no guarantee that someone will even see it—or that it will bring them into Popeye’s,” Alex says. “I would rather create an experience, give someone a warm, fresh meal. And maybe they’ll become a new fan.” So work smart, Alex says—and spin your marketing gears in ways that you can save money while maximizing your impact. Personalize the bang for your buck. Let’s say you have $1,000 to spend. You could become a gold sponsor for the high school basketball team and get a shiny banner in the auditorium. Or—you could show appreciation by feeding the team, the coaches and their families a pregame meal (or several) for the same cost. “In return, they’ll still shout you out as a sponsor,” Alex says. “I’ve gotten free ads in football programs. I’ve gotten free banners, our name on T-shirts. Just giving them a thousand dollars, versus giving them a whole meal—which gets you more in return?” Pick up recurring opportunities. A one-time donation is a great gesture of goodwill. But becoming a regular supporter keeps you giving back—as well as easing the stress and workload by standardizing your efforts. “Year after year, it’s not a lot of work because you know this month, you’re working with the school, and every summer you’re helping out the church camp,” Alex says. “You can really space it out, and it gets pretty easy once you get the ball rolling.” Focus on the return rather than the cost. When Alex first started as a director of marketing, she had a clear marketing budget. So one strategy she leaned into was gifting coupons for free kids meals to local elementary schools, which they passed on to students who made the honor roll. It cost her nothing more upfront than the cost of printing coupons—with a baked-in return on each freebie redeemed. “Yeah, you’re giving away a free kids meal,” she says, “but the odds of the kids coming to redeem that coupon and not having their entire family with them is very slim. You just gained a bunch of orders—and hopefully more loyal customers.” “You just have to be smart in where you’re spending the money,” Alex reiterates. “Create ways that get you benefits without wasting all your marketing dollars.” Get started—wherever you stand One of the beauties of Alex’s think-local strategy is that any franchisee can implement it, at any time, whether they’re looking to open their first restaurant or they already run a hundred. The core of her approach is to get food in the hands (and mouths) of the community. The beauty of it is, who’s going to turn down free food? “I never get told no,” Alex says. “If I reach out to an organization and ask if there’s any way we can help them out by donating food, they never turn around and say they don’t want our help. It’s not like a sales call, when you’re scared they’re going to say no. It’s a pretty easy path to gain those relationships and keep building them.” Free meals are indeed an easy sale—but here are some of Alex’s other bites of wisdom for getting things going: Begin within your means. You may not have the budget to embrace all three of Alex’s pillars fully. But you can pick and choose opportunities within each one. If feeding the football team or the marching band is too ambitious, what about the smaller basketball and volleyball teams instead? Or, offering them just sandwiches instead of full meals? Giving back and showing appreciation don’t have to happen on grand scales to be meaningful to the recipients. “I promise you, people are so appreciative of any donation, small or large,” Alex says. “We have given just biscuits before and it’s the best thing ever.” Be proactive in making your connections. Rather than waiting for organizations to ask you for donations and support, seek them out. You can imagine how much more meaningful an unsolicited donation is. It also shows consideration if you contact an organization to coordinate your offer when it works well for them—organizing a team lunch, for instance, rather than simply showing up one day with food. Start before you start— by which we mean, begin your efforts even before you open the doors. Alex goes full force on a grand opening. In the two months before opening, she reaches out to local newspapers, radio stations, law enforcement organizations, chambers of commerce, school principals, and invites them all to the friends-and-family soft opening. “The relationships just grow and grow,” she says. “And you never have to back peddle after you’ve been open for a year. We do it right off the bat to show we’re so excited to be in this area and join this community.” Final thoughts: Bridge the gap to the community The crux of Alex’s local outreach strategy is that she is not actively trying to sell her restaurants to the community. Her connections are genuine, her support heartfelt. Participating in the community is not simply a marketing strategy: it’s a goal in and of itself. “Number one is bridging that gap between the restaurants and the community,” she says. She points out that franchisees like her are not alone in this effort. Her general managers usually come from the areas that the locations are in. They have at least as many contacts as she does, and they tend to feel passionate about supporting their communities. “Our managers have relatives that work at the fire station, or their nieces and nephews and kids are on Little League teams,” she says. “We’re there to step in, help them out, and it means a lot to them, and to our business, and to our community.” Which is another way to say: bridging gaps starts with saying hi and offering your help. Anyone can do it. Simple as that. “It’s a lot of work, but if someone is out there who has never really dipped their toe in the local store marketing pool, they definitely can,” Alex says. “It’s very doable, and it’s never too late to start getting out there.” TAGS Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

Considering that the former has not been revised for over a decade despite increasing costs of living, hourly employees are understandably unhappy. With more workers going on strike to demand a higher minimum wage, you’re likely not surprised to see more companies offering higher pay to attract employees. On top of that, the pandemic went and caused a labor shortage across industries, giving workers the upper hand when it comes to their wages. With these changing circumstances, you need to make sure your hourly rates and benefits are on par. To help you, we compiled a list of companies that hire hourly workers and details about how they compensate their employees so you can get ideas on how to stay competitive. Honorable mention: Best Buy and their gift of time policy . 1. Costco In a competitive retail landscape dominated by giants like Walmart and specialized stores like Best Buy , Costco has carved out a unique niche for itself. This isn't just because of its wholesale model that offers a variety of goods at discounted prices. Costco has also set itself apart by focusing on employee well-being, particularly when it comes to hourly wages and benefits. You may have heard the rumors: \" Costco pays $21 an hour!\" While that number might not be the standard for all roles within the company, it's not entirely off the mark either. According to a recent press release , the typical pay rate at Costco Wholesale Company hovers around an impressive average of $18.36 an hour. This pay rate varies by role, with an hourly range that spans from $13.67 to as high as $28.96. What sets Costco even further apart are the roles that command the highest-paying wages within the company. Licensed Opticians, for instance, earn an enviable average hourly rate of $23.55. These rates put Costco ahead of similar membership-based retailers, such as Sam's Club , and even high-paying sectors like banking, represented by institutions like Bank of America and Wells Fargo . 2. Whole Foods Whole Foods, which became a part of its parent company Amazon in 2017, has consistently been recognized for offering excellent working conditions for its hourly workers . Since its founding in 1988, the company has frequently found its place on Fortune Magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For—underscoring its reputation as one of the companies that pay high hourly wages and offer numerous employee benefits. So, what perks does Whole Foods provide for its workforce? Full-time and part-time employees are eligible for a comprehensive healthcare plan, often comparable to benefits offered by companies like Aetna and CVS Health . Additionally, employees are enrolled in a 401(k) pension plan and receive a 20% discount on any in-store purchases. The company also offers a casual dress code at work, giving it an edge in the job search for many Americans . After a wage increase in 2018, Whole Foods set its minimum pay at $15/hour , making it one of the higher-paying entry-level jobs in the retail sector. 3. Walmart Walmart , the world's largest company in terms of revenue, has been making strides to enhance the working conditions for its hourly employees . This initiative took a notable turn when the company introduced a one-time $1,000 bonus for its U.S. workforce. Walmart has also revised its parental and maternity leave policies to provide more supportive conditions for employees planning to expand their families. What are the benefits Walmart employees enjoy ? The company offers a standard 401(k) pension plan and provides a 10% discount on store purchases, along with a special Christmas discount for employees. As part of its commitment to offer higher wages , Walmart increased its minimum hourly wage in September 2022 to $12/hour . However, in select stores located in areas with a higher cost of living , such as New York and Washington , the starting pay can climb to as much as $17/hour , making Walmart competitive among companies that pay high hourly wages . 4. McDonald's Unlike giants like Whole Foods and Walmart , McDonald's has historically struggled to keep all of its hourly workers satisfied . Amid the labor crunch that has hit the fast-food sector particularly hard, the company took corrective action by raising its hourly wages by around 10% . Currently, a McDonald's employee can expect to earn an hourly wage of over $13, with some locations offering between $11 and $17. It's worth noting that these adjustments are primarily for company-owned outlets, though franchised locations are under scrutiny to follow suit. The fast-food chain has publicly stated its goal to elevate the average hourly rate to $15 by 2024. Both full-time and part-time U.S. employees gain access to a 401(k) pension scheme, similar to benefits at Walmart and Whole Foods. The company also extends healthcare benefits, covering areas like dental and vision, making it comparable to organizations like Walgreens and Under Armour . McDonald's also has employee recognition programs designed to boost morale, crediting individual efforts and rewarding valuable contributions to the company's success. 5. Starbucks The famous coffeehouse is known for the comprehensive benefits it gives to its employees. Exclusively termed “ Your Special Blend ,” Starbucks ’ benefits include a 401(k) retirement plan and the opportunity to be a part of its equity reward program, Bean Stock. One particular benefit that stands out to us is the Starbucks College Achievement Plan, an educational benefit that helps Starbucks employees get a college education, even if it’s unrelated to their work at the company. Starbucks ’ employees currently earn an average of $14/hour . However, the coffeehouse brand will be increasing their hourly wage by next summer to bring the average up to $17/hour, with a new pay floor of $15/hour. This raise comes amidst its chronic understaffing issue caused by multiple factors such as COVID-19 and individuals finding jobs with higher pay. Now, Starbucks is offering jobs with hourly wages that are competitive in the market, positioning itself as an attractive employer not just for its benefits but also for its wages. 6. Chipotle Mexican Grill Chipotle , the Mexican-styled fast-casual restaurant, has gained much popularity thanks to their focus on providing fresh ingredients and fast service to their customers. Chipotle takes as much care of their employees as they do their customers. And, to hit their hiring goal of 20,000 new employees, the company introduced bonuses for crew members who referred their friends or family to the company. Chipotle also recently increased their hourly wages to attract more workers. Current starting wages for hourly crew members range from $11/hour to $18/hour, with an average of $15/hour. Chipotle employees enjoy several benefits, including a free meal for every daily shift, medical benefits, and a stock purchase plan for those who’ve been with the company for more than a year. The company also offers employees a 401(k) retirement savings plan after their first year. 7. Chick-fil-A Chick-fil-A was named one of the fastest-growing QSR brands in the country. And most of this could probably be attributed to its efficient drive-thru kiosks which were all the rage when the pandemic lockdown began. Even with the long queues, customers don’t mind waiting at all thanks to their exceptional customer service . And how about their hourly rates ? As Chick-fil-A’s restaurants are mostly franchises, the wages vary according to the states they’re in. But one thing’s for sure. Most owners intend to increase their hourly rates . One Chick-fil-A franchisee in Sacramento, California recently increased his employees’ wages to $17/hour to $18/hour in order to give them a “living wage.” Another owner from Greenville pays a starting wage of $13/hour along with a revised benefits package that includes paid time off for those who work 35 hours or more in a week. Again, the company also contributes to a 401(k) plan and health insurance for those who’ve clocked in 30 hours or more a week. 8. Target Target is the second biggest retail brand in the US, right behind Walmart . They offer employees a 401(k) pension plan and three weeks of vacation time each year—and, over time, that increases up to seven weeks a year. The company also recently increased its minimum wage to $15/hour, up from $12/hour in 2018. In addition, they also gave a $200 bonus to frontline workers in light of the pandemic . So, What Company Pays the Highest Minimum Wage? After examining the landscape of hourly wages , it appears that Costco leads the pack, followed closely by Chick-fil-A and Whole Foods. Costco sets a powerful example with their typical pay rate averaging around $18.36 an hour. Chick-fil-A franchisees, particularly in regions like California , are also inching upwards, offering rates of up to $18 an hour. Whole Foods has been consistent with a minimum wage of $15/hour, but what sets it apart is the comprehensive healthcare plan it offers, akin to what one might expect from corporate giants like JPMorgan Chase . It's important to note that geography plays a role in these wages. For instance, in states like Florida and Ohio , the minimum wage tends to be higher due to state laws or cost of living . Also, some companies like Disney and Apple , although not featured in this list, offer competitive wages and benefits to their hourly employees . IKEA is another company that, while not making our list, has been recognized for offering high wages and benefits to their workforce. Moreover, with the rise of work-from-home opportunities, some companies are rethinking their compensation packages, allowing for more flexible arrangements that might include other kinds of benefits beyond just the hourly wage . In a world where the fight for jobs with hourly wages that are livable is becoming increasingly critical, it’s heartening to see companies stepping up to the plate. Final Thoughts While the federal minimum wage is still at $7.25/hour, hiring at that rate is going to be tough. With the current hourly worker labor shortage, job seekers have many options—and call the shots. To make yourself competitive, consider the rates that these companies are offering and try to match (or exceed) to get future employees to notice you—and stay with you for years to come.

Finding and retaining good employees for your restaurant is hard. Far too often, by the time a hiring manager responds to an applicant’s initial inquiry, the applicant has already accepted a job at another local restaurant. When a GM is able to secure an interview, the risk of no-shows remains high. In fact, the rate of no-shows is increasing at an alarming rate and taking up valuable time on the GM’s calendar—time that could have been spent optimizing the restaurant’s operation. Complicating matters even more, the current labor shortage is creating a scenario where great employees are now working overtime to cover shifts, which leads to burnout and ultimately more turnover. The hiring crisis has shattered hiring norms that have long been held. We can’t keep doing things the way we’ve always done them because things are not how they’ve always been. Expectations no longer match reality. If you’re holding on to outdated hiring beliefs and practices, it’s time to find your new path forward. 1. Employees Leave Because They Can’t Handle the Pressure The QSR industry has been experiencing high turnover rates for years. The work is hard: peak periods can be chaotic, disgruntled customers can be overwhelming, being on your feet all day is physically exhausting. It’s easy to write off an exiting employee as someone who couldn’t handle the pressure. Many restaurants manage through this turnover by keeping a constant hiring motion in place. Finding another employee would be relatively easy. (Another outdated belief.) In the current labor climate with massive staffing shortages, conditions are getting harder. Long-time employees are being asked to work more overtime than ever. The increased workload and schedule disruptions are leading them directly to burnout—and feeling underappreciated. Today, to adapt and really address the core issue, more and more restaurants are offering retention bonuses and stipends. Why? To show employees they recognize their hard work by putting their money where their mouth is. For example, Greene Turtle CEO Geovannie Concepcion created a stipend program where short-staffed managers get compensated for extra work when employees don’t show up or the crew is short. The sports bar and grill chain also offers retention bonuses for each employee tier in an effort to retain top talent. Employees can handle the pressure, and they also want to be seen, heard, and appreciated. 2. Posting Your Job Opening on Every Job Board is Critical Well, this isn’t a bad or outdated practice. After all, you want to reach as many potential candidates as possible. What’s outdated here is how you do it. Today, too many hiring managers are still copying and pasting their job posts onto multiple job boards manually. Then they have to check all of these job boards continuously and respond separately on each board. But, the days of working in each job board are over—and the days of getting more time back on your schedule are here. QSRs at the top of their hiring game have moved on to a centralized job posting platform. With a single click, a job posting is listed across thousands (yes, thousands!) of job boards, including Monster, Google, and Facebook. From this same platform, hiring managers can also see how the applicant is moving through the hiring process. 3. Texting Employees is Unprofessional Many QSR owners and GMs are still relying on traditional communication methods (like phone calls) to screen applicants and schedule interviews. Many probably do this because it feels more formal, more professional. The problem with it is that today’s workforce—the younger generation—prefers texting or social media, even when it comes to connecting with a potential future employer. In fact, CNBC recently reported that the social media app TikTok is now a top place for restaurants to find Generation-Z workers. If you’re looking to be more competitive in hiring the younger generations of workers , you need to adopt more modern communication methods. 4. Hiring Happens Behind a Desk We’ve talked about the outdated practice of posting job openings and calling employees, both of which are often done during “office hours.” Let’s face it. GMs today, especially the ones who are stepping up to cover open shifts, aren’t getting their “office work” done in the timeframe they’d like. They’re leading the team, they’re serving customers, they’re keeping the lights on, and the business in the green. What they need is a way to staff up their teams faster. By using automation technologies, hiring managers across the U.S. are able to automatically screen applicants, schedule interviews, send reminder messages, reschedule if needed—all without lifting a finger. It’s great! 5. Employees Only Care About Hourly Wage In this highly competitive labor market, many QSR owners are still relying on wages and traditional benefits to entice new employees to join their teams. Benefits such as paid time off, health insurance, and free meals at the restaurant used to be enough to entice workers, but this is no longer the case. Employees want more. As QSR owners and GMs, you need to get creative with perks beyond paid time off and health insurance. The bar has been raised. For example, Starbucks offers their employees up to $10,000 for adoption assistance. They also provide tuition assistance for their employees to get a bachelor’s degree online from Arizona State University. Any unique benefits and perks you can offer candidates beyond paid time off and health insurance will go a long way towards attracting the most loyal talent. Your New Path Forward Traditional hiring and retention practices are now quickly becoming obsolete, but you’re ready to make changes to meet employees where they are. Technology will no doubt play a major role in the future of hiring and so will how we treat our employees. Both are within your control, and how you go about addressing both will set you apart from the competition—and set you up for success.

And in this Q&A, we learn more about encouraging individuality from IHOP Franchise Owner, Joseph Knight . Joseph has served the past few years as Managing Director of Operations for their various locations, and today shares with us his insights on the importance of inclusivity, empathy, and a nurturing company culture. Nicole (N): What is the biggest challenge you’ve encountered in your career? Joseph (J): The biggest challenge I have ever faced was to learn how to adapt and embrace failure. Within the restaurant industry, there are so many variables, some consistent and many unexpected.  To implement restaurant processes that improve overall restaurant performance can be quite challenging and rewarding at times. N: How would you describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? J: Our company culture gives everyone an opportunity to show us what they have.  We are very committed to challenging, supporting, training, building, and promoting from within.  We care about all of our guests, and we hold ourselves to high standards to ensure each guest leaves with the best customer experience. We have an awesomely diverse team that can find respect and value in their contributions here and we CELEBRATE it.  One of the actions most constantly displayed is a sense of love among the team members. It’s an environment where everyone truly cares about each other.  For example, a team member was working part-time with us and full-time with another company. He had a noticeable non-contagious skin condition that he was highly self-conscious about.  He quit his other full-time position with the other company because he felt isolated due to this condition.  He ended up coming to work with us full time because he felt part of the team, and his team treated him like they cared and did not make him feel like he needed to be quarantined. The superpower of our team is that we truly embrace our diverse and equal team dynamic. Not only do we demand it, but we also wouldn’t have it any other way.  When you work at any one of our locations, you are promised zero tolerance for workplace discrimination.  Many of our employees have expressed a sense of acceptance and freedom.  We foster a judgment-free zone where we take pride in giving individuals opportunities, bust through the stigmas, and become gainfully employed and prevent recidivism. N: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? J: The job market today has been extremely challenging . The talent pool has shrunk drastically.  Job offers are being made and applicants are not responding. Numerous hours go into recruiting, hiring, and training.   The turnover rate in the restaurant industry can be considerably high. N: How would you describe your leadership style? J: I am someone who believes in helping all staff members reach their full potential and their goals.  Oftentimes, the restaurant industry serves as a stepping stone for people in their lives. Most of our applicants that apply to be servers, table attendants, or cooks have no intention of staying in that position for too long. Our leadership style is to build leaders who then build leaders that go on to lead either within our organization, or their tenure with us serves as a catalyst for someone to master their position, which later results in a transferable skill in other industries. For example, being a server teaches you to have the empathy to understand what someone in front of you may be going through. Learning to have empathy for someone even when you don’t know them personally gives you a level of emotional intelligence and I think that is what a good leader needs.  Empathy/understanding of what your team is going through and share the feeling even when you aren’t going through it yourself. N: Who inspires you and why? J: My business partner and friend, Adenah Bayoh.  She is a successful entrepreneur and holds an extensive real estate development portfolio.  Every day, she sets an example of what I someday hope to become as a businessman and a leader. I feel very fortunate to be able to have a strong example of a leader in my life besides my parents. N: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience as an hourly worker. J: I was employed by IHOP when I was a teenager, as a server.  After taking a short break I returned back to work for IHOP while in college.  I am blessed to have parents who taught me to dream big.  My father was the one who noticed I enjoyed working for a restaurant and brought up the idea of owning an IHOP in the future.  At the time I didn’t have an understanding of business but because I showed a genuine interest in how things worked, I was coached on different aspects of the restaurant.  During this time I rapidly moved up the ladder with various roles of responsibility, and in 2013 I became the Managing Director of Operations for our locations.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/21/23 Your next best hire might come from a community organization Share this article Finding great workers in the current climate can be challenging. The competition can easily sweep up applicants, and hiring managers struggle to keep up with all the resumes flooding their open positions. With the current state of the job market, there's got to be a more human approach to hiring that allows companies to get to know applicants without spending hours in front of a computer. Enter community-based organizations. If you're intrigued by this unique way of hiring , let's dive into what community organizations are and how to use them to build a strong recruiting partnership. What is a community organization? As communities grow, specific issues become very apparent to local leaders. Community-based organizations fill those needs and make the world around them a better, safer, and healthier place. These organizations tackle issues like homelessness, hunger, youth involvement, life skills, and much more. Community organizations can look drastically different. Many of these organizations are small, local groups serving a specific area of the country. There are also some community-based organizations that have national name recognition but also have local offices or chapters. Your city will likely have several local community organizations you can tap into for recruiting help. Finding out which of these nonprofits are available in your area can be challenging, but it's not impossible. Connect with other business leaders in your city to see if they know of any organizations. Alternatively, you can meet some leaders at events like your local Chamber Of Commerce meeting. You can also look for press on these organizations in the local newspaper or do a quick internet search of community-based organizations in your zip code. Here are some examples of nationally recognized and local community organizations that companies can partner with: YMCA Girl Scouts Boy Scouts City Harvest Cara Collective 5 tips for creating a recruiting partnership with community-based organizations Now that we’ve established what a community-based organization is and how to find one, let’s move into some helpful strategies that will make working with these groups successful. 1. Remember that community-based organizations are not Indeed Since its inception, Indeed has made a significant impact on the job market. It has a massive database of applicants, allowing for a great experience for hiring managers. Community-based organizations serve a completely different purpose and give companies a different competitive advantage. Community organizations help you dive deeper and get to know applicants you might have passed over with traditional hiring sources. Indeed provides companies with a ton of qualified candidates , which hiring managers then have to sort through to find the ones who are the best fit for their business. Community groups take a different approach. Your liaison will likely have an intense knowledge of the community they serve. They can find applicants that fit your needs based on your job description and their deep knowledge of the candidates they have. Then they can help you see those qualities by coaching each applicant they work with. The scale of this approach will not mirror how posting on Indeed nets a ton of applicants. Instead, you'll get a few handpicked applicants that stand out and help you fill positions without a ton of extra work. 2. Have a clear sense of what you’re looking for Do you know the kind of applicant you’re looking for? Unlike a job board, you can get precise when partnering with a community organization. Sit down with your community organization partner to describe exactly what you’re looking for and the kind of person that would be successful in the role. Here are some questions to consider when you’re thinking about the applicant you want to hire: What qualities are teachable versus something that a candidate absolutely must possess ? What personalities work well in your organization and the role you’re hiring for? How long do you want this applicant to work with your company ? Are there any adjacent positions an applicant may have held in the past that give them a leg up when applying for the current role? 3. Don’t be afraid to test out different community organizations to find your match Working with one community group is not a contract. It’s important to test the waters before working on a deeper partnership. Try to test a few different placements with a few organizations to get a feel for how they handle the process. Community groups can be a trustworthy partner for your recruiting needs. They’re fully tapped into the market and understand what's happening in your local area. Groups should feel comfortable stepping up and guiding you to place jobs more successfully. Consider common hiring metrics when tracking if an organization works for you. For example: Time to interview/Time to hire : How long does it take to get applicants to interview and hire once you send a job opening? Quality of hire : Once you have a few employees from a community org, what is the quality of that hire? You can measure tenure, look at absenteeism and callouts, and talk with that person’s manager to see how the hire is doing. Cost per hire : Partnering with a community org costs money. How much are you spending to acquire each person you hire with each community org you are testing? It's important to track this information and compare the different groups you’re working with to each other and your traditional hiring sources. Once you crunch the numbers, you'll likely know precisely who to target for a deeper recruiting partnership. 4. Once you find an organization, dig deeper to create a partnership Are you ready to go beyond one-off job placements? Try creating a deeper recruiting partnership where you work closely with 1-2 community organizations. When you set up a recruiting partnership, the organization you work with will be able to devote more time, attention, and resources to filling your open positions. Before deciding on a partner organization, consider the communities that have provided the best results for your team. Who has sent you quality hires that get through the process quickly while having a decent cost per hire? Beyond the hiring metrics, which organization is the best to work with? Which team would you actually want to work with on a deeper level? Creating a partnership is about more than results. You'll spend a lot of time with the team you decide to go with. 5. Use community organization resources to support your employees in the long run Community organizations want the hires they place with you to be successful. On top of placing great applicants, many organizations have excellent resources their hires can continue to use even after getting a job. If you notice that a new employee you got from a community organization is struggling, try contacting the organization to see if any resources are available. For example, if you notice that a community organization employee doesn't have reliable transportation to work, see if they can get a complimentary transit pass or if the organization provides a transportation service. Before you give up on an employee or let them go, it's crucial to determine what support systems exist to make that new hire more successful. Community organizations are a great tool in your hiring arsenal Hiring is often daunting. There are many strategies you can use to source great workers . Tapping into your local community is a great way to give back while also filling open roles. If you want to use this strategy to find your next hire, setting expectations is important. Hiring through a recruiting partnership like this will net different results than using Indeed or LinkedIn, but the quality of hire can be just as good, if not better. Finding the right communities to tap into takes time, but you'll find an organization that can meet your needs before you know it. Start small, and you'll be getting stellar results in no time.

Yet, finding new, qualified candidates isn’t always easy: More than 3 in 4 hiring managers say attracting high-quality job candidates is their greatest challenge. Employers can lose up to 89% of their candidates if their screening process is too long. Companies that create a strong candidate experience can increase the quality of their candidates by 70%. Hiring and retaining top talent is all about making it easier for your team and your candidates. Luckily, there are resources available that can help you work smarter, not harder, as you build your dream team. How can I post a job without paying? Wondering where to post jobs for free? In 2023, you don’t have to pay to play in the job recruiting arena. But as you’ll find out in this guide, there are limitations to this. Most free job posting sites offer free and paid account options. Free usage ranges in both features and access, with some platforms offering as little as one free posting. Yet, features like hiring metrics, application tracking, and unlimited job postings can only be accessed through premium memberships or sponsored job ads. Still, there are several free job posting sites and job posting templates that can jumpstart your search without requiring a steep investment. 11 Free Job Posting Sites As an employer, you always strive to find the best talent for your organization. However, searching for talented individuals can be quite difficult and time-consuming, especially if you don't know where to begin. Fortunately, there are several job posting sites and job posting examples available that can assist you in this endeavor. But with so many job posting sites to choose from, how do you know which one to use? The best job posting sites and aggregators for you depend on your organization’s unique needs. To make your job as an employer easier, we've compiled a list of the pros and cons of some of the best free job posting sites as of April 2023: 1. Indeed With over 300 million unique monthly visitors, 245 million resumes uploaded, and 790 million total ratings and reviews, Indeed comes out on top as the #1 job site. As an employer, you can post jobs on Indeed for free, with no hidden costs. But as one of the most popular free job posting sites, it’s no stranger to tough competition. Pros: Its high volume of users increases your reach and candidate pool. Indeed offers free hiring tools for employers, such as job skill assessments and tests. Ideal for large-scale hiring initiatives. It works for full-time, part-time, and contract positions. Cons: High volume of users = High volume of competition. Some job types aren’t eligible for free unlimited postings. Finding quality candidates on Indeed without sponsoring your job post can be difficult. It’s not recommended for attracting high-level candidates. 2. Handshake Looking for new grads? Handshake is one of the unique free job posting sites that doubles as a networking platform. It allows employers to interact with students and new graduates. You can connect and post job listings for free. Handshake advocates for supporting diverse candidates, with over 12 million active students and alumni on the platform. Pros: Easily set up virtual interviews with candidates. It’s great for filling entry-level and remote open jobs. You can join virtual networking events to find new candidates. Cons: Not beneficial for mid or senior-level positions. You’ll need a premium membership to source quality candidates, check into events, access analytics, and more. 3. Google for Jobs 73% of job candidates start their search on Google. This makes Google for Jobs a prime opportunity for employers and recruiters. Google for Jobs is different from most free job posting sites in that it’s a service rather than its own platform. It gathers data from other job posting sites to feature the roles that best align with the candidate’s needs. It’s completely free to use and doesn’t allow for sponsored job listings. Pros: It can increase your visibility in job search engines. Thanks to its specific, helpful job filters, it can allow you to attract more qualified candidates. Cons: Google for Jobs doesn’t allow you to view a candidate’s profile or access a resume database like other sites. You have to use third-party sites to access the service. You’ll need to understand Google Analytics and structured data to fully access its benefits. 4. LinkedIn With over 900 million members, LinkedIn is a powerhouse for finding quality candidates and connections. Unlike other free job posting sites, LinkedIn job posting can get your open positions in front of new candidates and establish your company as a thought leader in the process. Yet, you can only post one free job listing at a time on LinkedIn. You’ll likely need to sponsor your job listings to enjoy its features. Pros: The platform’s popularity and success can increase your candidate pool. It’s great for sourcing low, mid, and high-level candidates. It offers affordable pay-per-click sponsoring options to increase visibility. Cons: You’re limited to posting one free job posting at a time. There’s a high level of competition, making it difficult to succeed without sponsoring your job openings. 5. Jora Jora is one of the best free job posting sites that caters to an international audience in over 30 countries. It’s comparable to Indeed’s interface but offers a much smaller candidate base. Employers can post up to 10 free job listings each month on Jora. Pros: It can connect employers and candidates throughout the world. It offers a U.S. career portal to allow employers to only focus on hiring local candidates. Cons: It has less traffic and a smaller user base compared to other platforms. No resume database for employers. There aren’t many features for recruiters or employers to enhance their search. 6. Wellfound You likely know Wellfound by its former name, “AngelList Talent.” As one of the top free job posting sites available, Wellfound specifically helps tech companies and startups attract new talent. Wellfound offers free unlimited and paid plans for employers. So far, they’ve matched 6,000,000 positions and offer access to over 8 million tech-driven candidates. Pros: Wellfound offers advanced search filters, helping you find the right talent. Employers can access free applicant tracking and messaging tools to connect with applicants. Great for remote job opportunities and application processes. Cons: It’s limited to recruiting for startups and tech companies. It offers fewer automated features compared to its competitors. 7. Ladders It’s one thing to find candidates — but it’s another to find the right candidates. This is especially true for companies and recruiters looking to fill high-level positions. Ladders allows employers to connect with professionals looking for positions paying $100k or higher. As a whole, it offers free and paid job listing options. Pros: It’s great for attracting experienced candidates. It advocates for salary transparency. Employers can receive notifications when there’s an applicant who fits their hiring needs. Cons: Features and access are limited for free members, such as candidate contact information. The platform has a high number of negative reviews. The premium plan is more expensive compared to competitors. The free job boards are only accessible for high-paying positions. 8. Learn4Good On the opposite side of the job search spectrum, we have Learn4Good: One of the free job posting sites that focuses on creating opportunities for students. As an employer, you can create a free account that gives you 20 listing credits to use over 6 months. You can pay to upgrade your account and receive more credits. Pros: Learn4Good is great for recruiting students to fill entry-level positions and internships. No credit card is needed to sign up. Cons: The platform’s credit system can be difficult to understand. Your number of credits limits the number of job listings you can post. 9. Jobcase Jobcase has over 120 million registered candidates and 20 million unique visitors each month. It’s great for making quick connections and offers a community-like feel for candidates. Employers and recruiters can join Jobcase for free, but they'll need to pay to access its complete benefits. Pros: Its specific job search algorithm only shows candidates the positions they’re qualified for. Cons: Users have expressed difficulty when trying to delete filled positions. The algorithm can be too exclusive; your listing might not be shown to as many applicants if your qualifications are too specific. 10. Hubstaff Talent A recent survey found that nearly 1 in 3 remote employees would quit their jobs if they had to go back to the office — and almost 1 in 4 would take a 10% pay cut if they could work from home permanently. Hubstaff Talent is a great resource for connecting potential candidates with employers for remote positions. As an employer, you can post unlimited free job postings and access helpful recruiting features. Pros: It’s great for attracting remote-savvy candidates. It offers free unlimited job postings. Employers can easily contact and track applicants. Cons: It offers a smaller candidate pool compared to its competitors. It’s only helpful for filling remote jobs. 11. PostJobFree The name speaks for itself: PostJobFree allows employers to post 10 free job listings each day. The platform offers premium memberships, which unlock benefits such as access to applicant contact information and resume views. Pros: You can post free job listings across job boards. They offer a comparably affordable premium plan, making it great for small businesses. It’s a long-standing online platform, in operation since 2007. Cons: Job postings are not unlimited. There’s no available applicant tracking system. The site’s user experience isn’t as seamless and trustworthy as its competitors. FAQs About Free Job Posting Sites Can you post a job on ZipRecruiter for free? No — ZipRecruiter doesn’t offer any free plans as of April 2023. However, they do offer a 4-day free trial. You can post an ad and work with any candidates you receive during this timeframe, free of charge. Pricing plans start at $299 per month. This membership comes with customizable tools and templates to boost your talent search. However, ZipRecruiter has relatively fewer resumes in its database than other platforms. Is there a site where people post looking for jobs? Great question! Most career sites are designed to put employers in charge of the hiring process, ensuring they find the best talent available. However, social-driven job posting platforms, like LinkedIn and Handshake, allow candidates to create their own content, reach out, and build their presence. You may find candidates seeking positions by searching the #opentowork, #jobsearch, #hireme, #jobseeker, and #jobsearching hashtags on LinkedIn and other social media platforms. Find some creative job postings examples here. Is it free to post jobs on LinkedIn? Yes, but it’s limited. You can post one free job at a time on LinkedIn. Free job listings expire within 21 days of your post date. All free job listings will appear in LinkedIn’s search results, allowing you to receive, filter, and manage your applicants. With the right job title and job description, you can find success in finding the best candidates. However, free LinkedIn job posts can quickly become less visible in candidates’ search results. When you’ve hit a certain number of applicants, your free listing will be removed from the search results. However, promoted LinkedIn job postings reach an average of 3x more candidates than free postings. They are featured at the top of search results, stay active until you close them, and receive unlimited job applications. Another alternative to LinkedIn job posting is Craigslist job posting .

Perhaps you're looking into a temp-to-hire agency, which may help in reducing the time and cost of hiring. Discover the meaning of temp-to-hire agencies, their pros and cons, and whether this is the best solution for your organization. What is temp-to-hire? Temp-to-hire means a job opportunity that is initially temporary but is used to help the employer determine if the temporary worker can eventually be a long-term fit with the company. This is in contrast to a temporary job with a predetermined start and end date or a direct hire which is a permanent position. Temp-to-hire agencies help in the initial recruiting process, from advertising for the position on job boards to conducting interviews, accepting applicants, and running background checks. With agency assistance, the hiring manager can spend more time on other strategic initiatives rather than devoting most of their time to fulfilling hiring needs. Which industries rely on temp-to-hire? 16 million temporary employees are hired every year across different industries. 64% work these positions to fill gaps between jobs. Temp-to-hire employees can be found in nearly all occupations but are mainly found in multinational corporations (MNCs), especially in the retail and food and beverage (F&B) industries. Retailers tend to look into temp-to-hire workers due to fluctuating seasonal demands. During peak periods, retail businesses often experience a greater strain on their workforce due to an influx of customers. In times like these, businesses might feel pressured to bring on more help. Unlike true temporary workers, temp-to-hire employees offer businesses the opportunity to build up their workforce beyond just the busy season, which can set them up to withstand the inevitable turnover in these industries. Similarly, the F&B industry gravitates towards temp-to-hire employees due to seasonal peaks or last-minute absences. These employees help to keep their businesses running smoothly even with a manpower crunch or increased demands. Other industries include construction, hospitality (due to fluctuating staffing needs), and even medical (clinics, nursing homes, and assisted living facilities). The pros of temp-to-hire agencies Many organizations have introduced temp-to-hire to their hiring strategy and have seen great success. If you're still evaluating if you should adopt this strategy too, here are some factors you can consider. Speed and efficiency Having an agency onboard optimizes the hiring process because your hiring team can offload a lot of the sourcing and screening. You can focus on hiring quality candidates by interviewing those shortlisted by the agency. This also allows you more time for day-to-day operational work and other critical tasks. Reduced risk Temp-to-hire agencies assume the legal responsibilities of being an employer, from taxes to health insurance coverage and even payroll. They can also help you to avoid unnecessary paperwork. Imagine spending time to enroll these employees for health insurance and other programs and having to terminate the employee or have them quit a few weeks in. With temp-to-hire employees, you can include them in your systems only when you're confident of the hire. Your hiring team can then focus on only managing the permanent employees. Increased flexibility When an employee is temp-to-hire, you have the luxury of taking time to determine if they're the right fit for the role and company. It acts as a trial period. If it works out, they can be converted to a permanent role. But if it doesn't, the relationship can be easily terminated without the hassle of sorting out employee paperwork, payroll, and benefits. Ensuring that they're a good fit reduces hiring costs and also increases retention. Furthermore, the first 90 days of employment are crucial for every new hire, as it allows them to learn, meet their coworkers, and become familiar with your organization . Ensuring that your employee is a good fit with the team during their first 90 days will be effective in reducing turnovers. Increased motivation With the knowledge that they could be converted to a permanent employee, these temp-to-hire employees may be more motivated to prove their capabilities. This could be in the form of contributing more to the team, speaking out, and raising new ideas to earn themselves a permanent place. Boost employee morale Experiencing an especially hectic season? Having additional temp-to-hire employees to lighten the load will be greatly appreciated by the team and will reduce employee burnout. This will create a less-stressed and more confident environment. If temp-to-hire employees prove that they can contribute effectively to the team, they can be offered a chance for conversion. Furthermore, these employees will also have the chance to build relationships with the permanent employees they’re working with. This saves time in retraining and building new connections as opposed to re-hiring a completely new person for the job should you be using temporary employees. The cons of temp-to-hire employees Temp-to-hire isn't the right strategy for everyone. Rather than continuously testing out employees to varying degrees of success, some businesses employ an always-on hiring strategy instead, meaning when they always hire qualified applicants whether or not they have a position open. This helps combat turnover concerns and enables you to build up your bench of high-quality workers. Some other concerns to consider with temp-to-hire agencies are: Higher costs Should you find a worker you love, there may be a buyout fee involved when hiring through an agency, and this can be as high as 20 to 25% of the worker’s salary. Additionally, the base salary for a temp-to-hire worker may also be higher since they’re not able to enjoy the full benefits of being a permanent staff member. Less loyalty There is a possibility that temp-to-hire employees are less loyal to the company. Since the job is not guaranteed, nor is it always aligned with their passions, these employees might not be as invested as their permanent peers. They may not see the point in building relationships with coworkers or going above and beyond basic responsibilities. Lack of teamwork Full-time staff may hesitate to train a temp-to-hire worker knowing they could be gone soon. Temp-to-hire workers might not be able to fully bond with their teammates, as they could be brought on to help with a seasonal project and are thus only working closely with a small portion of the team. Legal risks Like every other employee, managing temp-to-hire employees comes with legal risks. With laws on worker statuses and eligibility, contracts have to be well drafted. Some legal risks include having illegal workers who may not be eligible to work in your country, or others with poor work records who may pose a risk of danger to your organization (be it due to theft or unsafe work). In the event of an audit, you need to ensure the agency remits the necessary paperwork to the appropriate government agencies. This is particularly important when it comes to health and safety, where temp-to-hire agencies must follow all labor regulations to prevent them from implicating your organization's reputation if found otherwise. Temp-to-hire workers should also still be treated with respect and without discrimination to prevent lawsuits. You should always investigate an agency’s treatment of employees before signing on to work with them. Reputation issues When you manage hiring internally, you control all steps of the recruitment process. However, by depending on the staffing agency, you're relying on their professionalism and recruiting methods. Should an applicant have an unpleasant recruitment experience with the agency, it may reflect poorly on the reputation of your business. Culture gap The agency is unlikely to have a full understanding of your company's culture. This means that shortlisted applicants may possess the right skills and experiences, but may not be the right fit for the rest of your team in other aspects. The good news is that this can be resolved easily, by implementing an internal screening process in addition to the agency's recruitment procedure. Limited applicant pool With perceived lower job security and reduced employment benefits (paid vacation time, health insurance, etc.), applicants are less incentivized to apply for temp-to-hire openings. As a result, your agency may be working with a more limited candidate pool, which may affect the quality of your candidates. Should you go ahead with a temp-to-hire agency? With the rise of temp-to-hire strategies across many industries, this may be a tempting solution to your hiring woes. Evaluate the pros and cons, as well as the current structure of your company's recruitment process, to determine if it's a right fit for your organization's hiring strategy.

Here’s how it works: Workstream now integrates with WOTC.com , the leading platform to manage all aspects of the WOTC process. WOTC.com makes it simple to submit the appropriate applications and forms, track qualified WOTC candidates, and process the reports and final forms needed to process and receive the tax credit. With our integration, employers can now set up a smart screening step during the hiring process to automatically pre-select WOTC candidates when they apply. All you need to do is to set up a quiz stage specific to WOTC as the first stage in the worker application, where they will pre-qualify themselves by answering WOTC-related questions. These questions can also include other filters such as years of experience, active credentials, and availability, making it easy to find the applicants you’re looking for. Workstream automatically scores the quiz and will progress applicants to the next stage in the hiring process if they qualify. If not, then your hiring manager can manually review them and decide whether to move them forward or not. Finally, once an applicant is marked as “hired” in the system by the hiring manager, Workstream will automatically trigger the workflow of sending the offer letter and help you complete the necessary forms for the WOTC process, both for you and your new employee. With the WOTC.com integration, this process will help managers be certain that they will receive the tax credit as soon as possible. Workstream is the simplest and most foolproof way to find, screen, hire, and onboard WOTC qualifying workers, and now our integration with WOTC.com makes the WOTC process simple. What is WOTC? The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a federal tax credit available to employers who hire from certain pools of targeted groups. It’s an incentive to hire workers who may often be passed over during the hiring process. These groups include : Veterans Ex-Felons Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Recipients Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Recipients And more While businesses should be looking to hire from these groups anyway, it’s a good move for the government to provide a monetary reason to do so as well. These employers can receive a WOTC tax credit amount that varies depending on the hired individual’s classification, ranging from $1200 to $9600 per worker. There are some catches to the WOTC that employers should be aware of, none of which are very high bars that should scare anyone off: The credit is equal to a percentage of the employee’s wages. In general, as long as the individual works 400+ hours, the employer will receive the full credit available at the individual’s classification. Former employees cannot be rehired to quality for the tax credit. The credit can be claimed for a total of 2 years. Employers who haven’t taken the full credit due to tax liability limitations can carry back the credit 1 year, or forward 20 years. For more information on WOTC, please head to the pages on the Department of Labor website and the IRS website .

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 09/02/19 3 Reasons to Use Texting to Recruit Hourly Workers Share this article It has become pretty apparent that using texting as the main form of communication between employers and applicants is the optimal, but not everyone on the hiring side of the spectrum has taken initiative to utilize texting for their hiring process. So I wanted to break down the advantages and reasons of advancing from email to text during recruitment. We have really come a long way. Evolving from Morse code to payphones to landlines, to now having personal mobile devices, all for improving communication. Throughout the development of technology, one constant trend is the fact that everyone has become more and more reliant on their cellphones. This might have something to do with all the new features and capabilities equipped with phones today, or it could be because our cellphones are the gateways to the rest of the world. Regardless of the journey, one undeniable fact is that since the phone and internet became a single device… cellphones can now be considered an item of clothing, because people do not leave their homes without it. Therefore, it is evident that using texting to recruit outweighs traditional communications methods. First, texting can be considered the most direct way of communicating. One major evidence being that push notifications are on by default for texts. Unlike other notifications from Facebook, Instagram, and emails, that require physically setting notifications, when you receive a text message, you will be notified. Making it the most effective way of getting in contact with someone. Communicating via text can also achieve filtering out the applicants that are serious from those who are not. Even the most responsible ones sometimes don't get a chance to check their emails, but if you are reached by text, those who have prioritized getting the job, will make a point to respond promptly. Unlike the rest of the noise that come with being connected to the world, employment opportunities are of relative importance to anyone that has intentions of being a contributing member of society. Making it a matter of importance deserving of being able to directly contact the individuals seeking those opportunities. Second, people do not like to take phone calls or check email often. Sending a text is not as direct of an approach than a phone call, and not as passive as an email. It's the perfect in between way to stay in contact with someone. Phone calls may feel invasive, unless there is a mutual understanding of the urgency of the matter, while emails and snail mail are easily overlooked. Texting allows that layer of personal space by giving the recipient room to respond when they find a free time, without undermining the importance of the message. Most people, millennials especially, prefer this method of communication for anything of relative importance, making directly messaging an individual the best way to get them through the hiring process. Third, texting is the most personal, making it the easiest way to communicate. Texting is especially effective and efficient is simply because getting someone's cell phone number can be considered a relatively personal piece of information. In comparison to all other forms of contact information to give out, giving your cell number to someone can be considered your most personal piece of information. Because it's basically giving them to way to reach you at any point in time. If you are looking at from an employer perspective, the time and effort put forth in trying to see if the applicant is a good fit for the team, is essential to building great teams and the progression of that company. Employers deserve to utilize the most evidently effective way of interacting with opportunity seekers. Texting and having that bridge of direct communication with individuals for professional reasons is one of the main underlying purposes of advancing technology. For all these reasons, communicating via text with applicants should be the new standard for all recruitment tools. Not to abuse this power and invading personal space, but when it comes to matters relating to employment opportunities, it is now a common belief that texting should be the preferred method of recruitment communication, for all the above reasons. Workstream is a software built to hire hourly workers using texting and automation, making the recruiting process as easy and efficient as possible.

I thought so too myself. I started out working as a Product Manager for WeChat in New York, and thought that if I wanted to start a company, I needed to be the technical Co-Founder and to partner up with a local person who can do business development or sales. At that time, I believed that this was my only path as an immigrant entrepreneur with an accent and no understanding of local lingo or culture. Fast forward to a class I took at Stanford Business School , called Startup Garage, I was instructed by Professor Zenios to speak to 100 customers and learn more about their pain points and challenges. This was the very class where start-ups including DoorDash, SoFi and more were started. So I did exactly just that. I spoke to several hundred local businesses which was a segment that I was passionate about and grew up in. These included restaurants, cafes, hotels, and retail companies. I was surprised to find myself enjoying the process of connecting with businesses, building trust and learning from them. I found out that I was in love with engaging with people and finding out how I could help them. I continued talking to more customers and learned to answer open ended questions just as Professor Zenios taught me to. I also listened to their responses and avoided making rash conclusions about their pain points. But above all, I paid attention to their actions and observed how they responded in different situations. A customer may not know whether they have a pain point or a gap, but by watching their behavior and listening with intent and empathy, you can learn a lot. I proceeded to start Workstream and secured Coupa Cafe as our first customer right in the heart of Stanford University. I recalled clearly sending my first cold-email to Camelia, the owner of Coupa Cafe asking for a meeting. Within a couple of hours, she replied saying she was open to meet and connect. I quickly responded in the next minute and asked for an in-person meeting the following day. I met Camelia and I was truly intrigued and impressed by the amazing business she had built. Coupa Cafe is known to be the most popular place among Silicon Valley superstars, and yet here she was, taking time out to meet me . We shared about our backgrounds and I had the opportunity to learn about the challenges she faced running the business which translates to an opportunity for me. In the last 15 minutes we had, I pulled out my laptop and showed her our product demo. She was clearly impressed, but said she will get back to me. A couple of days later, Camelia wrote me back saying “Desmond, I like to get started on Workstream!” Bam! I closed the first deal in Workstream history - an indescribable adrenaline rush rushed through my veins and I was overjoyed. That was the moment when I knew I was in love. I was in love not with the typical process that other folks would call “sales”, which by a quick Google search refers to “the exchange of a good or product for money ”. In my mind, it was a connection - an exchange of ideas, an opportunity for me to create impact. I was able to share my ideas, and have the opportunity to help to impact changes not only for Camelia, but also for over three hundred employees that worked for Camelia. I was able to transform the hiring and on-boarding process for a local business and its stakeholders. Sales became my opportunity to meet people, get to know them, figure out how we could connect, and how I could potentially help them. Over the next year, I went on to speak to over 2,000 businesses such as Jamba Juice, Sightglass Coffee, Sports Basement, and Westin . I enjoyed every conversation I had. Every interaction gave me the opportunity to connect with business owners, managers and leaders. I grew up with both my parents working as hourly workers who went on to run small businesses. Meeting these local businesses made me feel like I was given the opportunity to help people just like my parents who are more than 8,434 miles away from San Francisco back in Singapore. In the following year, I was able to grow my team and bring on more folks into the sales and business development team. This leads to the second reason why I enjoy sales – having the opportunity to foster teamwork, camaraderie and to help others grow. I enjoyed sparring with Angel over sales tactics that she learned from Yelp. I enjoyed helping our intern Brandon to get up to speed with the latest email templates. I enjoyed working with Austin as he joined me to conduct his first ever interview for a potential candidate. I was overjoyed when Jaron, one of our first customers and former owner of Utah Maids, joined our team where he shared his personal experiences of being a business owner. Seeing him do so reminded me of how much I enjoyed discussing sales processes I learned from past experiences with Drew and Adam. I am humbled and thankful that through sales, I had the opportunity to work with my team, help them grow, and work towards a common vision and goal. In that sense, sales to me is much more than exchanging a product or service for money. The money is secondary, but the opportunity to connect with people, build trust, and help them grow is the real reason why I found myself leaning in on sales despite my inclination as an immigrant founder to not do sales. Through sales, I discovered my passion to connect with people and create impact.

Most of us do. Oftentimes, it’s a little scary; young workers are learning a lot about relationships and responsibilities. It’s a right of passage that sets the tone for future jobs. If you’re a franchise or QSR owner, chances are you employ a lot of first-time workers, which brings both its benefits and challenges. These Gen-Z workers might be a little cheaper to hire, but they also require more guidance. So how do you ensure the experience is great for all involved? Here’s how to create a work environment for first-time employees that helps them do their best—and reaps your business the benefits. 1. Create a straightforward onboarding process Onboarding can be a complicated process. Employees are often thrown into a mountain of paperwork that takes hours to complete. Paperwork for minors usually has another layer of complexity because their parents often have to be involved. Some documents, like Form I-9 , are time-sensitive. While seasoned workers may be used to the fast pace of onboarding, first-time employees may still be getting all the proper documents in order. Creating a straightforward onboarding process starts before day one. After you extend a job offer, sit down with the new employee to go over what the onboarding process will look like. Create a checklist of what documents the employee will need and what forms they will fill out. Or use an HR management tool that handles the process for you. Solutions like Workstream can even send onboarding documents to new hires via text , making it easy for them to check off each task and sign documents before their start date. 2. Be present and communicate with new employees Starting a new job can be overwhelming. There is so much to learn and do. Some Gen-Z workers might be nervous to ask questions or ask for help, causing more problems down the line. Open communication can transform the employee experience . Managers of young employees should be patient and present, anticipating questions that may arise and proactively checking in to allow their team members to speak up without feeling like they’re behind everyone else. 3. Create a mentorship program Managers are only one of the assets new hires can use. A mentorship program can help Gen Z workers feel comfortable at their first job . Pair new team members with more seasoned employees who are patient and enthusiastic about the job to create a positive and helpful relationship. Here are some strategies to make mentorship programs work in an hourly environment: Ensure that the mentor and mentee share at least 1-2 shifts per week Encourage mentor/mentees to take breaks together to learn more about each other and connect Pay mentors/mentees for 3-5 hours per month to connect outside work Check in with both parties to ensure they get something valuable from the program 4. Offer flexible scheduling options Many first-time workers are in high school or college, so unless you hire them for seasonal summer work, you’ll need to work around their school schedules. High school students often have the same schedule from August to May, with some time off for winter, spring, and summer breaks. College students have wildly different schedules from day to day and semester to semester. If you know scheduling will be tricky before hiring them, you can set the right expectations upfront. When you hire a first-time worker, ask for their school schedules and any time they'll need off upfront. Before each semester lets out, ask for an updated schedule so you can be on the same page. Schools often post their general schedules so you know when students might be out and when to ask for schedule updates. 5. Provide a clear career path Starting your first job is exciting, but the intrigue can wear off after a while. Creating a clear path forward can give workers something to get excited about. What options does the first-time worker have if they stick with your business? Do you have a lead or manager program? Can they work in other departments? Could their tenure lead to a scholarship? When creating a career path, it's essential to consider what matters to your employees. McDonald's Archways To Opportunity program is an excellent example of this. Working at McDonald's can offer employees a chance to get a free high school diploma, improve their English skills, or even go to college tuition-free. 6. Host team-building activities First-time employees don't have a ton of experience working with other people. They likely haven't worked closely with another person outside of a school project. When you employ these young workers, you’ll probably spend a lot of time training them on basic employability skills like communication, teamwork, decision-making, and problem-solving. One way to train your team is by hosting team-building activities. No, we aren’t talking about trust falls here. Team-building can start small. For example, take a few minutes during a team meeting to ask an icebreaker question and get employees to answer it. 7. Celebrate milestones and achievements as they happen Can you imagine how amazing it would be to make it to the 90-day mark in your first job? What about working at the same place for an entire year? How about making your first big sale? These milestones are a chance to celebrate your first-time employees and show them the impact of having a job. Keep these celebrations simple but impactful. Saying thanks/congratulations, writing a thank you note, or giving employees a small gift card as a token of appreciation can work wonders. You don't need a big budget to make employees feel appreciated . Create an excellent environment for first-time employees by meeting them where they are Employing a first-time worker requires a certain amount of sacrifice for companies. While you can typically pay a lower wage, you’ll need to do a significant amount of training to get the most out of these team members. If you have patience and meet these team members where they are, you’ll create a successful team, even if your employees are inexperienced. Most importantly, you’re setting a standard for how these workers will approach their careers for the rest of their lives. This is a lot of responsibility, but it only takes a bit of support to create an environment your team can thrive in.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 06/26/20 How to increase employee engagement through texting Share this article As renowned business magnate Sir Richard Branson once said, \"Clients do not come first. Employees come first. If you take care of your employees, they will take care of the clients. \" One of the best ways of ensuring your employees are well taken care of is to keep them constantly engaged. Engaged employees are often more productive and loyal and have greater job satisfaction. In today's ever-changing work environment, the use of technology is on the rise. HR leaders are leveraging new technologies to communicate with their hourly employees. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , hourly workers make up nearly 60% of all workers in the US. These hourly employees tend to consist mostly of Millennials who are constantly on their mobile devices. Therefore, using text messages to communicate with employees is a great engagement strategy. Reducing employee turnover with engagement The Society for Human Resources Management ( SHRM ) cited a study by PeopleMatter, a workforce management platform, that surveyed 974 service industry professionals. The study revealed that two-thirds of respondents stated they needed a larger pool of applicants and 60% are not satisfied with the current quality of applicants. As a result, turnover for those surveyed was extremely high—costing roughly $4,969 per employee. Pay service DailyPay found that the cost of turnover for warehouse workers can be up to 25% of an employee's salary. According to Salary.com, the average salary for warehouse workers is approximately $28,000, meaning employers spend about $7,000 to replace every warehouse worker that leaves. It seems to be a universal fact that the turnover rates of hourly employees will always remain high. To reduce this high turnover rate , HR leaders should come up with employee engagement strategies since engaged employees are committed to their work and goals and tend to be aligned with the business' mission and vision. Moreover, employee engagement increases customer satisfaction because people who are passionate about their work and truly in tune with their job description are often the best people to interact with your customers. The rules of engagement In a study conducted by Bain and Company , responses from 200,000 surveyed employees in 40 companies across 60 countries uncovered three fascinating trends: Engagement scores decline as employee tenure increases. In other words, employees who know the most about the company and have the most experience are usually the least engaged. The employee engagement scores decline at the lowest levels of the organization, meaning the front lines, or for most companies, the hourly employees. Engagement levels are lowest in sales and service functions. Again, these are usually hourly employees, and unfortunately, where most interactions with the customers occur. To address challenges, HR leaders can apply five main practices to effectively engage their employees. Focus on the individual. While it's important to strive for teamwork, leaders have to first dedicate time to mentor their employees on an individual level and tailor the mentorship to bring out individual employee's strengths. Apply the Pareto Principle. The Pareto Principle is a theory maintaining that 80% of the output from a given situation or system is determined by 20% of the input. Putting this back into context, in order to improve employee engagement by 80%, HR leaders have to focus on ensuring at least 20% of their hourly employees are engaged. Make time for special days. This includes birthdays and work anniversaries. Give recognition frequently. Recognize your employees' hard work and dedication. Make it easy for employees to provide feedback. Listen to your employees' concerns, comments, suggestions, and feedback. Let them know that everything they say has weight and as employees, your value their feedback. The tools of engagement According to a Pew Research Center analysis of US Census Bureau data, 35% of the US workforce is made up of Millennials. This is noteworthy, especially since Millennials are generally more tech-savvy. Tapping into the latest technology is a great way to communicate with your employees. One of the easiest ways to do this is to use text messages to communicate with employees. In fact, another Pew Research Center report found that text messaging is the most widely used smartphone feature. With everyone on text messaging , what are you waiting for? Unlike salaried employees, your hourly employees often do not have access to email or Slack, depending on what form of communication your business uses. This could cause your hourly employees to feel disengaged and distant from the core team. Using text messages to communicate with employees allows them to stay engaged and in contact with the rest of the company. Texting at work can make it easier to schedule shifts. Often, hourly workers can face sudden personal schedule changes, and they need a way to communicate about them quickly. By providing text messaging as a form of communication, your hourly employees will be able to manage their schedules easily on the go with their mobile devices. Workstream tip: Your text messages should be genuine and encouraging. Begin with texting at work When should you begin to use text to communicate with your employees? We recommend employers start using text communication right from the very start, even before an employee's first day on the job. You can use text messages to onboard your new hourly employees, send them reminders to fill out paperwork, or even schedule interviews during the hiring phase. This helps employees understand the basic communication practice at your company before they join the team. Once texting is established as the standard mode of communication, you can use it as one of the ways to increase employee engagement that we discussed earlier. For instance: Focus on the individual. Leadership expert and author of Developing the Leader Within You , John C. Maxwell, states that six of the most important words an employee can hear is, \"What you do makes a difference.\" When an employee doesn't believe that what they're doing has a positive impact on the success of the company, they lose interest and become disengaged in their work. Make the effort to text your employees and let them know how important they are to the organization. Using text messages as one of the ways to increase employee engagement can be extremely powerful. For most Millennial hourly workers, smart phone can be seen as their world. Receiving an encouraging text from their employer has an immediate impact especially when they least expect employers to show their appreciation while they are physically not at work. Apply the Pareto Principle. Text communication with your hourly employees can bring about two huge benefits. It is important to note that when you apply the Pareto Principle, it doesn't mean you only try to engage 20% of your employees and neglect the rest of the 80%. It simply means that you need to pay EXTRA attention and focus to 20%. When you pay much more attention to this group of 20% through your encouraging text messages, they start growing to become strong and loyal to your company. They may start feeling engaged and that their work has been noticed and appreciated by the management team. When done well, this group of 20% would then be able to motivate the rest of the 80% of their co-workers and help the whole workforce grow together and strive for greater productivity. Make time for special days. Keep a calendar of special days such as birthdays and work anniversaries of your employees. Take note of the small details of their lives like the name of their first child etc. Remember to address your employee by their name along in a text that either congratulates or wishes Happy Birthday with a personalized note. Everyone wants to be remembered on these special days. By sending a text message to your employees on these dates, they will feel valued and touched that their employers bothers to remember the smallest details of their lives. Give recognition frequently. There are many ways to show appreciation to your employees. Avoid waiting for the next time they come for their shift work to tell them how much of a great job they did the previous week. Instead, send a text message directly to them, showing them that you appreciate their work and you value them so much that you decide to send a text just in the middle of the day. You can also opt for company-wide text messages to give kudos to your valued employees. Let's say you learnt that an employees went above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction. You can send a company-wide text to thank them for their hard work so they feel recognized, and also allows for other employees to learn from him or her. This helps to set the tone that every employee will get recognized for their hard work by the entire team, and hence engaging them in an inclusive community. Make it easy for employees to give feedback. When you open up the use of a two-way communication tool like text messaging rather than a simple survey form for employees to give feedback, you will feel an increase in employee engagement. Make it known via the employee handbook that any feedback is accepted via text. Let your employees know that they are empowered to send creative ideas, suggestions, critique of a policy, customer service comments and generally any feedback to you directly. However, that's not all. You have to ensure that these feedback provided are acted upon. The ideas, suggestions and comments should be addressed in a timely manner and a personal return text should be sent so that employees feel that their opinions matter. For some, texting may not come naturally. In fact, some may even consider this to be impersonal and too casual. Yet, it is important to acknowledge who your employees are and be the one that engages them on a platform that they are most familiar and comfortable with. Text messaging has been their number one form of communication. The tools that can be used for creating a more engaged workforce will continue to evolve as technology continues to advance.

Share this article The number of job openings in the U.S. reached a record high of 9.3 million in April , yet unemployment is also bordering at an estimated 5.9%. As businesses head towards a new normal with more Covid-19 vaccinations rolled out, and new measures in place, the labor market is expected to fluctuate and change yet again. The pandemic has also created a significant impact in frontline jobs which involve close proximity and physical contact, with many organizations scrambling to find digital alternatives to reduce contact. With drastically changing demands and economic situations, what exactly is the future of the labor market? Let’s delve into the current trends, and how Covid-19 has impacted the labor market. By understanding how these trends work, you may be able to take preemptive measures and navigate these uncharted seas. Number of Job Searchers will Increase The $300 unemployment boosts are coming to an end , and most will occur before the expiration date of September 6. As more workers are looking to replace these benefits with a new stream of income, many will be searching for jobs. Some of these workers are likely to start their job hunting during this season, to prevent a last-minute scramble for jobs only when their unemployment benefits come to an end. Preference for Remote Work With new work from home arrangements in most organizations, many employees are getting used to working longer hours, yet also becoming more productive with their time. This trend is likely primarily reflected in higher wage jobs, with 60% of high earning workers being able to do their jobs effectively from home compared to 34% of low-earning workers. However, work from home arrangements are not set to take over job routines completely, as plenty of jobs will still require workers to be physically present. This is especially so in the QSR sector, where customer service is crucial and of the priority, an experience that cannot be replicated online. Organizations will need to be flexible, while planning for and offering hybrid remote work opportunities after the pandemic to cater for this new preference. Additionally, many processes have also shifted online, including recruitment - with contactless hiring through virtual interviews and even video resumes. Rise of Digitalization Many companies are going digital and adopting technology with online menus and self-checkout options, while simultaneously outsourcing their work to robots and artificial intelligence applications. These implementations are likely to displace workers (especially low wage workers) on a much larger scale. The largest impact will be in food services, retail and hospitality . Workers will be expected to upskill, and training will be necessary to ensure that their skills are not made irrelevant with technological advancement. QSRs will also have to look into how to adapt and pivot their businesses digitally , to remain competitive, especially because these implementations help meet changing demands as a result of Covid-19. Eventual Increase in Job Openings Covid-19 vaccinations, alongside pandemic aid from government, has facilitated the reopening of the economy. U.S. job openings have risen to a two-year high in February, and we can expect these figures to continue increasing as the world returns to a new normal. This hiring boom is led by the hospitality and food services industries, with an increase of 220,000 jobs. Competition within the labor market is high, due to the high unemployment rate. This means that organizations may have the upper hand in choosing candidates, while candidates will possibly have less bargaining power than they used to. However, the opposite is true too, due to the hiring sprees going on in the QSR industry as they prepare for reopening. Organizations will likely have to compete with one another to attract the candidates they desire. Fierce Competition for New Hires Given the increased demand for new hires in the QSR sector, many QSRs are raising wages and increasing incentives to appeal to applicants. This may be attributed to labor shortage, especially since less people are willing to work in the frontlines in a pandemic situation. There is also a gravitation towards jobs which allow more flexibility, and working from home, which are perceived to be safer. With changing expectations, there is a desire for higher pay and better working conditions, as workers have to take on additional expenses such as child or elder care given the current situation. McDonald’s has been raising its wages, and plans to reach an average of $15 an hour by 2024, while Chipotle is also dishing out referral bonuses of up to $750 for apprentices or general managers. QSRs have been passing down these additional costs in the form of menu price increases to customers. It is therefore crucial to understand what employees want , to be able to meet these changing expectations and successfully attract desired applicants. The Need to Hire More Creatively To stand out from competitors, it is essential to look into creative and unique hiring processes. We’ve previously summarized some tips on creative job postings , such as through hiring parties, recruitment webinars and fresh recruitment videos, which you may consider for your QSR. Leverage the benefits of the various social media platforms, to maximize the applicant pool, especially since different platforms attract different demographics. To effectively reach out to Gen Zs, explore Tik Tok for job postings; whereas Millennials and Generation X can be found primarily through platforms such as Twitter . Finally, consider the use of hiring tools while experimenting with digitalization. Features such as mobile training , video resumes and virtual interviews will be more relevant as organizations begin a gradual transition online. Automated recruitment processes including smart screening and integrated calendars will also be effective in saving time and making the hiring process more convenient for both the applicants and hiring managers. To Sum Up There is a need to constantly monitor the labor market as demands and expectations are always evolving, and organizations will have to stay above the trends in order to remain competitive. Although the future of the labor market is unpredictable, understand and apply what these workers are looking for when they’re applying for a job and you’ll be able to successfully win them over.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 10/22/21 Restaurant budgeting: How to offset rising business costs Share this article You already knew running a restaurant was a financial risk. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, around 17% of restaurants close during their first year . So, if you want your business to stay afloat, or better yet, turn a profit, you’ve got to adapt. With restaurant budgeting tactics, restaurant owners can offset rising business costs and have a lucrative, long-lasting business. Here’s a quick preview of what we’ll cover: Simplify your menu Streamline your hiring process Prioritize retaining your staff Reduce food waste Invest in self-ordering kiosks Add more flexibility to your budget But before we get into all of that, let’s start with a question that’s probably on your mind… Which business costs are increasing for restaurant owners? No matter what type of restaurant you’re running, there are a few rising business costs you need to know about, especially when considering restaurant budgeting. Let’s take a look at each. Restaurant labor costs. Fast food and restaurant workers are demanding higher pay nationwide. Many are pushing to increase the minimum wage to at least $15/hour. Whether you agree or disagree with this push for higher wages isn’t so important—at least not in this current conversation. What is important is that you realize that hiring new, qualified employees will likely become more competitive and expensive from now on. Shipping and logistics costs. The labor shortage isn’t just affecting your restaurant business. It’s affecting the shipping companies that are essential to your food supply chain. With increased safety regulations, there are fewer truck drivers on the road and fewer people interested in the profession altogether. As a result, the price for goods delivered to you has increased. Chai Pani Restaurant Group COO Stack revealed that their business costs have increased 3-4% due to higher delivery costs. Wholesale food costs . According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, wholesale food prices have increased by 1% every month since the beginning of 2021. And that cost burden has been put on restaurant owners as raw ingredients are now more expensive . The owner of Jeju Noodle Bar in New York City had to take chicken wings off their menu to avoid upsetting customers with insane prices. Safety and sanitation costs. Your restaurant budget now needs to account for new Covid safety regulations . As you probably know, the price of cleaning and sanitary items, such as gloves, masks, disinfectants, and hand sanitizer, is now a significant addition to your business expenses. The owner of Matador Tacos and Tapas reports spending about $800/month on disinfecting services . 6 restaurant budgeting tips to offset rising business costs You can’t really control any of the rising business costs we just shared. But you know what is in your control? The power to adapt and adjust restaurant budgets by doing things like... #1 Simplify your menu Does your menu really need all of your current offerings? Probably not. So, get critical and strategic by removing items that your customers aren’t really buying. Why do this? Because it will help you reduce your wholesale food costs, allowing you to purchase in bulk the items you need for your remaining menu offerings. But before committing to one final simplified menu, you may want to try out different versions of the shortened menu to see how it affects your monthly earnings and customer satisfaction. IHOP shortened its menu from 12 pages to 2 pages by keeping popular items that are easy to prepare. This change has made it easier for IHOP franchises to train new workers and reduce waste from unused ingredients. #2 Streamline your hiring process You know how hard it can be to find and hire quality candidates. You probably also know that it isn’t just difficult. It’s also time-consuming and costly—especially during the current labor shortage . Our recommendation? Evaluate and improve your hiring process. For example, you can do things like: Eliminate redundancy in your application form (e.g. asking candidates to submit a resume and also manually fill in information about their work experience) Remove questions that are unnecessary for the job at hand or can be found in the applicant’s resume—these questions can deter top applicants Invest in HR technology that makes it easy for you to evaluate and easily follow up with the applicants who have the most potential for success For example, take a look at this Chick-fil-A franchisee’s success in improving their hiring process . By adopting Workstream’s all-in-one hiring solution, they managed to get four times as many qualified applicants as before and reduce their interview no-show rates by 50%. #3 Prioritize retaining your staff Do you know your staff turnover rate? If not, you should. Because staff turnover is a hidden labor cost for any type of business. By retaining quality staff members, you don’t have to spend time, money, and resources on hiring. According to a Gallup survey , replacing an employee can cost one-half to two times that employee's salary. So, what are some things you can do to reduce turnover and boost retention ? Invest in your employees. For example, you might offer additional training to help them grow professionally in ways that are directly and indirectly related to their role. The Boston-based restaurant Tuscan Brands offers hands-on culinary school training to all of their employees. Do all of their employees need this training to do their job? Nope! But it gives them the opportunity to learn more about the restaurant’s offerings while gaining skills they can use to advance their career. #4 Reduce food waste This isn’t just a tip to be more eco-friendly. With wholesale food costs up, it’s time to get serious about reducing food waste. According to a recent report from Champions 12.3 , for every $1 invested in programs to reduce food waste, restaurant budgets save an average of $7 in operating costs. What steps can you take to implement a successful food waste reduction program ? Start by auditing the amount of food your restaurant wastes per month. During your audit, categorize the waste to get an idea of where the majority comes from (e.g. spoiled inventory, kitchen scraps). Then look for ways to either repurpose the waste, adopt tools to better manage your inventory, or stop buying or buy less of the frequently wasted products. #5 Invest in self-ordering kiosks With changes in consumer behavior, self-ordering kiosks deserve your attention. Yes, purchasing this technology requires a financial investment. But it’s worth fitting into your restaurant budgets. Why? Because the return on investment, now and in the near future, could be huge. Here are two examples of restaurants that have benefited from this strategy: McDonald’s increased their sales by 5-6% in one year after introducing self-service kiosks Chili’s introduced the self-order service Ziosk and had a 20% increase in appetizer sales What makes the self-ordering kiosks particularly useful? For one, they can help reduce labor costs. They also help to enhance customer experience by reducing order errors. Lastly, the contactless nature of self-ordering kiosks aligns with customer expectations for safety . #6 Add more flexibility to your budget Flexibility is key to every aspect of your business, including your restaurant budget. By having a flexible budget, you can more easily pivot your focus on spending or saving if needed. As we mentioned earlier, expenses for things such as takeaway containers and sanitary items have increased the average operating costs for a restaurant. On top of that, you probably need to invest more in digital marketing to attract customers who now spend more time online. How can you start adding more flexibility to your restaurant budget? Aim to create multiple budgets that account for different scenarios and ongoing uncertainty. For example, you can create three different budgets that you can consider conservative, moderate, and aggressive. To make this process more efficient, consider investing in restaurant accounting software . Final thoughts The average operating costs of a restaurant have increased. This is in large part due to higher costs for labor, logistics and shipping, wholesale food orders, and safety regulations. These things are largely out of your control. But that doesn’t mean your restaurant’s financial future is doomed! By being strategic, you can get innovative in your restaurant operations and approach to restaurant budgeting.

Unfortunately, your HR challenges likely don’t end there. With an employee turnover rate of 130% across the entire restaurant industry, employee retention has become just as big of a problem for QSRs as hiring. Many restaurants in the United States lose more than one full workforce every year. To say that these numbers are staggering would be an understatement. As a QSR owner or GM, it can quickly become demoralizing to work so hard to hire a team only to see them slip away so quickly. So, what can you do about it? The Answer: Engage Your Employees More and more QSRs are realizing they have to do a much better job of engaging their workers if they want to break the vicious turnover cycle currently plaguing the restaurant industry. It’s estimated that disengaged employees cost U.S. companies as much as $550 billion per year. This means that for those QSRs who are able to continuously refill their rosters throughout the year, the cost of doing so is very high. The message for QSRs is clear: If you want to reduce your labor expenses and increase your retention rate, you must actively invest time and resources into boosting your employee engagement. The challenge for many QSRs is how exactly to best engage employees. 4 Ways to Increase Employee Engagement 1. Use Surveys to Listen Many QSR GMs believe that they’re in touch with their team members’ thoughts and feelings. However, these same GMs are often surprised when an employee leaves the company—proof of the disconnect that exists. An excellent way to lay a strong foundation for employee engagement is to regularly survey your team members. Surveys provide an objective view for you to understand the true state of your team’s feelings about work responsibilities, environment, culture, etc. It’s important to require all team members to complete a survey while also giving them the option to remain anonymous. It’s equally important to conduct these surveys at regular intervals, such as quarterly, so you can track and measure improvement over time. 2. Recognize and Reward the Team All of the pressures facing QSR owners and GMs today are causing unintentional neglect of some of the most important keys to their team’s success. One of which is employee recognition . A variety of stressors—including economic pressures from the pandemic and an extremely tight labor market—have caused some QSRs to let employee recognition fall by the wayside. When restaurant leadership is (with good reason) hyper-focused on keeping the doors open, it can be hard for them to rise above the pressure and remember the importance of recognizing their employees. No matter how much pressure you are under and how limited your time is, it’s imperative that you make employee recognition a priority, especially if you want to decrease turnover. The more time that passes without recognizing an employee, the higher the chances of that employee leaving. One to keep this at the forefront of your employee engagement strategy is to designate one or more of your managers as the Recognition Leader for the team. The appointed manager will be accountable for regularly recognizing employees for their contributions. Recognition alone, however, is not enough. It’s also important to back the recognition with a tangible reward to really signal gratitude toward your employees.  For example, if an employee goes a certain number of days without an absence, you could reward them with a gift card to a store they enjoy. By putting a recognition system in place backed by accountability and coupled with a goals-based rewards program, you will give a huge boost to your employee engagement and substantially decrease your turnover rate . 3. Conduct Stay Interviews Exit interviews have become commonplace across many industries in the U.S. They can be valuable because they shed light on why an employee is leaving the team. Insights gleaned from exit interviews help managers know what changes they can make to improve conditions for existing and future employees. There is no doubt that exit interviews will continue to be a valuable tool used by QSRs to increase future employee engagement. What’s less often considered is the stay interview. A stay interview is an interview conducted with a current employee who has not shown any indication that they plan on leaving the team. Stay interviews can be thought of as personalized employee surveys with much higher quality feedback. A stay interview takes place face-to-face, one-on-one. The purpose of the interview is to gauge that specific employee’s satisfaction level with the restaurant and their feelings about their future path with the organization. Perhaps the biggest benefit of a stay interview is the mutual trust that is built between manager and employee. In a successful stay interview, the employee feels heard and the manager walks away with a much better understanding of the challenges that employees face on a daily basis. 4. Invest in Employee Development and Well-Being Some QSRs have been resistant to investing in employee development and well-being programs. Many fear the perceived impact these programs may have on their bottom line. However, many owners are now realizing that this view towards the bottom line can be shortsighted in light of the long-term negative financial impact of high turnover rates. In other words, an investment in employee development and well-being programs leads to a long-term positive effect on the bottom line by reducing costs incurred by high turnover rates. The reality is employees know if they’re just a number or if they’re a team member who is valued as a person. Many QSR employees have a long-term plan in mind for their careers, and they may view their current role as a stepping stone to the larger goal. It’s important for managers to engage in a discussion with employees about their career goals. These managers need to be equipped to offer solid career development programs that they can easily offer their employees in order to demonstrate that they really do care about that employee’s career. QSRs are now starting to couple well-being programs with their career development programs. These programs address work-life balance priorities and initiatives. They also provide resources for employees to pursue physical and mental health and well-being. Options such as gym membership subsidies, nutrition programs, and psychology resources are just a few examples of benefits QSRs are rolling out to improve employee engagement in a meaningful way. Retaining employees may feel more daunting than ever. Luckily, the strategies and options for increasing employee engagement are stronger than they’ve ever been. Implementing one (or all) of the approaches outlined can substantially make a difference in your restaurant’s retention—especially if you continue to refine your approach to meet the specific needs of your workforce.

In fact, the largest retailer of America is the biggest private employer. What's even more fascinating is that half of their workforce are hourly workers or part-time employees. Even though they already have a large workforce, Walmart is constantly expanding, building new stores, and hiring new employees. The retailer’s operations are also known to be smooth, with rarely any problems. How do they do it? For one, they are able to maintain a large base of satisfied employees, which is achieved through several practices that the organization deploys through their HR efforts. In this article, we are going to discuss how Walmart is able to maintain their management efforts to keep their hourly workforce motivated. Consistent Employment Retention Strategy Every organization today must be able to retain its employees. If we’re being honest, recruiting and onboarding employees is not that difficult as compared to retaining them for a long time. This is especially true when it comes to part-time workers. And Walmart recognizes this - which is why they have a comprehensive HRM: Recruitment, Selection, Employee Retention strategy. It's in Walmart's interest to improve their employee retention strategies as much as they can so that they can minimize the company’s turnover rates and the costs that come along with it. After all, the consequences can get pretty severe if they were to have a high turnover rate. Ensuring that their employees are retained for the long run will prevent them from incurring unnecessary expenses that could have otherwise been avoided. Walmart has a combined set of approaches to achieve high employee retention. Here are their most applicable strategies for this purpose: Recognizing and acknowledging employees based on their performance. Giving employees added benefits based on their position or status. Providing incentives to employees based on their position and status. In most cases, companies don't include their hourly employees in their retention strategies. Walmart, however, makes it a point to ensure that the set of approaches above applies not only to their full-time employees but their hourly ones as well. Affordable Insurance and Healthcare Options Most of the time, companies don't provide any welfare benefits to their part-time employees because they don't consider them as dedicated members of their organization. This, however, is not the case for Walmart. The giant retailer gives eligible full-time and part-time associates affordable options that also include full coverage of preventive care. Aside from that, Walmart offers medical plans that start at $25 per day, which includes optical and dental schemes. They also provide domestic coverage partners and have a program that covers advanced procedures such as lung cancer, knee or hip replacements, heart procedures, spine procedures, and many others. What’s more, all of the part-time employees get free access to healthcare advisors and nurse care managers in the company. These are just some of the insurances that Walmart offers for their hourly staff and there are, in fact, more than they can provide. This is the very reason why the giant retailer is appealing to their employees and the main reason why they stay with the company for a long time. Not many companies in the country would provide for their part-time staff as much as Walmart does. Flexibility in the Workplace Every part-time or hourly employee chooses this type of employment for several reasons. Some may just be retirees who want to fill their time doing something while others might be students who want a flexible work schedule to fit in with their existing school commitments. Thus, while they may not receive higher salaries as compared to their full-time counterparts, they do enjoy flexible working hours. All they have to do is ensure that they clock in a certain number of work hours each month. This opens up the opportunity for them to focus on other ventures in their life, such as education, training, or entrepreneurship. Additionally, Walmart is constantly upgrading their parental benefits to give more flexibility to parents. Hourly workers that become parents through foster care programs, adoption, or birth can get as much as 6 weeks of paid leave. 10% Employee Discount Apart from giving hourly employees solid salaries, great health insurance, and the ability to get as much free time as they need, Walmart also provides a 10% discount to all their employees . This is why a lot of college students choose to get a job at Walmart: it provides them with sufficient income and allows them to reduce their grocery expenses (we all know how expensive college can be). Furthermore, since they have flexible work hours, they can always choose to work less to focus on their studies during their examination periods. Taking into account all of the factors above, it is no wonder why Walmart has many satisfied part-time employees and is also able to retain a large number of them in the company. In some cases, these employees eventually become full-time workers as they choose to further develop themselves and their career with the company. Consider adopting some of Walmart’s HR strategies - who knows, you might just be able to improve your company’s standing in the years to come!

With people out shopping with friends and visiting family, restaurants will be entering one of the busiest times of the year—and needing more hands on deck to serve customers. Hiring seasonal employees can be one of the best ways for you to keep things running smoothly and have a successful holiday season. If you’re looking to build out a seasonal hiring strategy, here’s how you can get started. How to Plan for Holiday Hiring Getting a hiring plan together well ahead of the holiday rush is incredibly important. After all, you’re not just competing for employees who are eligible to work at other restaurants. You’re also going after the same employees that Amazon, which is projected to hire 120,000 temporary workers for the holiday season , is hoping to hire. So, it’s best to get an early start with your hiring efforts. When building out your plan, the first step is to determine how many employees you need and what positions you need to fill to support the influx of patrons. To help you predict what those needs are, take a look at the numbers from the last two holiday seasons—everything from how many employees you had staffed at different times during the day or week to your total throughput. This data will serve as your baseline. From that starting point, ask yourself how things went over the last two years. Did you have enough team members to cover all shifts, even after accounting for possible sick days or time off? Would an extra cashier help you serve customers faster? What could another cook do to relieve the stress in the kitchen? From there, determine if you need to scale up or down staffing and for which roles. How to Hire Hourly Workers Once you know which roles you need for the holiday season, it’s time to put your plan into action. Start by creating job postings that will attract applicants with the skills, traits, and experience that will help them and the restaurant be successful. Remember, the holiday season is fast-paced, so you may want to look for employees who are extremely customer-oriented, friendly, fast learners, and work well under pressure. Also, keep in mind that the people looking for seasonal work are likely also looking for something specific. To create job postings that appeal to employees who might be out to earn extra spending money, save up during college break, etc., be sure to call out how you can help them meet their needs, whether that’s competitive pay, spot bonuses, or flexible schedules. From there, you’ll need to advertise your job openings, and the earlier the better. Use job boards that are specific to your industry Post hiring signs in your restaurant as well as in the drive-thru Pass out flyers at local events and schools Incentivize employees to share the postings with family and friends Use social media to reach more potential candidates And don’t forget the people who worked for you last year. Reach out and see if they would like to come back. Before you start widely promoting your job openings, be sure to have efficient tools to make the hiring process easy and quick. The last thing you want is for the busy season to pick up and be so understaffed that you have no time to review incoming applications. One way to help speed up the process is to have a simple application process. The easier you make the application process, the more applicants you’ll see complete it. Once you start seeing applications roll in, be sure to review them as quickly as you can and get back to the applicants as soon as possible. With so many restaurants hiring for the holidays, you’ll increase your chances of landing your next hire by being the first to respond to their application. To make the process easier and faster (for everyone), consider using automated technology and two-way texting . It allows you to engage applicants with little effort and gives them the ability to self-schedule their interviews, which also reduces ghosting . How to Set Up Your Hourly Employees for Success Once you’ve hired your team , you want each of them to be ready to work. Sometimes that takes a little time and forethought. Your new team members likely won’t be ready to jump straight into work at 100% efficiency. So, as they get started and learn the ropes, have extra team members present for the onboarding process. Have a dedicated, permanent employee take each new hire under their wing as they get trained. Many people leave a job before their first few days because of poor training, and giving each new hire a point person to support them will help them thrive. Also, make sure your employees know what’s expected of them. Great general managers and business owners practice clear communication. It’s difficult for an employee to be successful if they don’t know what that looks like. As you onboard each new employee, make sure they understand their responsibilities and that they feel well-trained to perform each task. If/as you notice work not being completed as instructed, be prepared to coach and correct them. Last, but not least, don’t forget to show how excited you are about them joining the team. Nothing will give an employee more confidence about making the right employment decision than having a boss (or the owner!) be supportive and encouraging. Final Thoughts The holiday season can be stressful. With the right team in place, it doesn’t have to be. With a little time, you can implement a powerful seasonal hiring strategy to help the holidays be a little more stress-free and a lot more profitable.

Share this article According to the latest Labor Department Data , 82.3 million workers ages 16+ were paid at hourly rates . That’s a whopping 58.1% of all workers in the US, while the other 41.9% makes up the rest of the full-time salaried workforce. These numbers tell us that there are many employment options available, both hourly and salaried. So, the question becomes which is better for your company? Similar to an exempt vs non-exempt employee , choosing salary vs hourly can sometimes be unnerving. There are tons of different factors to consider: the employee’s workload and responsibilities, relevant state laws, benefits, wages, overtime pay , number of hours and much more. Before you decide, you will first need to take note of the differences between the two. Is it better to be paid salary or hourly? As the name suggests, hourly workers are paid an hourly wage while salaried employees earn a preset amount that isn’t dependent on the hours they work each week. Ultimately, you will want to figure out which type of employee is more cost-efficient for your company and this article emphasizes the benefits of both hourly and salaried employees and offers tips to help identify which is best for your organization’s needs. Read on to find an in-depth analysis of salary vs . hourly positions . What are the pros and cons of salary and hourly? 1. Hourly employees receive additional compensation for overtime, whereas salaried employees collect regular and consistent paychecks. An hourly employee working overtime will receive time-and-a-half for every additional hour after their first forty hours . If they regularly work more than forty hours a week, they may earn more money than they would in a salaried position . However, you can keep these costs down by preventing employees from working overtime and limiting their hours. A salaried employee , on the other hand, will receive regular and consistent paychecks, but if they’re required to work overtime, they won’t receive compensation for the extra hours . It’s important to determine how frequently they might be asked to work overtime at a particular position. If it’s often, hiring salaried employees may be more economical than recruiting hourly workers . However, do take note that some states have expanded eligibility for overtime, so be sure to check your State’s Department of Labor guidelines. 2. Hourly employees receive holiday pay , whereas salaried employees usually receive paid time off and additional benefits. Though there are no federal or state laws requiring companies to pay more than the usual hourly rate on holidays, companies do typically pay extra for shifts that take place during these periods. This is a subtle way to give thanks to your hourly workers . If your organization requires its employees to work on holidays, be prepared to fork out more capital to cover their wages. In the case of salaried employees , employers are still expected to pay them a commensurate salary if they decide to go on leave for a particular holiday. This is because salaried employees receive benefits such as paid sick days , paid time off, and sometimes even health insurance . Under certain circumstances, however, it is legal to deduct from your salaried workers ’ paychecks when they miss too many hours. Our advice to you? Take into account how busy your business operations will get during the holidays. If your increased profits offset the higher labor costs incurred from hiring hourly workers , consider employing them instead as they will probably be more incentivized to work during the holidays as compared to salaried workers . 3. Hourly employees have more flexibility in their schedule, whereas salaried employees have a predetermined schedule and mandatory overtime when needed. Let’s say you require your employees only on some days or at a particular time; hiring hourly employees will probably be the better choice for you here. Since you will have more flexibility in determining their schedule, you can ensure that labor expenses are incurred only when you need the manpower. Meanwhile, salaried employees will earn the same income whether or not they have tasks to complete. While this may mean that your payroll process will be easier, you might be wasting your resources in cases where they come to work with nothing to do. However, if you consistently require their support for your business operations, a salaried worker will probably be better than an hourly one since you don't have to track their working hours. Salary vs hourly: In summary If cost is a big factor in determining the type of employee you should hire, consider using this hourly wage index for hourly wages and this salary calculator for determining salary. This allows you to objectively see the total costs tied to an employee and lets you have a better understanding of the labor and overtime expenses borne by your company. It is impossible to state whether it’s better to hire an hourly or salaried position without knowing your organization’s needs. Each has its pros and cons, so the best thing you can do is to analyze the demands of your company and check whether they are in line with the expectations that come from a particular type of worker. Ultimately, it is important to review your contract to ensure that you adhere to the labor regulations in your county or district. Looking for ways to hire more efficiently?

Globally, the size of the Spanish-speaking population is second only to Mexico and actually larger than Spain. As our nation’s Hispanic community continues to grow, it’s more important than ever for businesses to learn how to attract Spanish-speaking workers. Learning how to hire in Spanish might seem overwhelming at first. But the value of finding ways to include Spanish in your hiring process for the benefit of native speakers is too great to ignore. Unlocking a significant portion of the workforce By 2050, Hispanics will represent nearly 30 percent of the US population. For companies not prepared with hiring tools in Spanish or without Spanish translations for hiring procedures on hand, this demographic shift (and its dramatic effect on the job market) could prove challenging. But with an effective strategy in place to recruit those native Spanish speakers, your business will gain both a new source of potential applicants and a competitive edge in the hiring process. This is especially valuable when you consider the ongoing worker shortage. Even though many industries have now rebounded since the pandemic, leisure and hospitality are still 500,000 workers short . Not to mention, 2.1 million manufacturing jobs could go unfilled by 2030 . This is precisely why tapping into the 62.6 million Hispanic population for hourly workers makes sense. Ensuring equal opportunity by providing multilingual applications When it comes to differentiating yourself as an employer, providing Hispanic applicants with the option to choose a hiring experience in their native language is a smart strategy. Not only for the convenience, but offering Spanish applications lets you make sure everyone gets a fair chance. Why? Applicants who are otherwise highly qualified and ideal fits for your workforce may not be comfortable with (or may even feel intimidated by) completing a job search in their second language. Being thoughtful enough to include hiring tools in Spanish and give applicants equal employment opportunities is also good business. Making accommodations to remove biases and ensure people are hired based primarily on skills and competencies will give you an edge in the war for talent, especially when those Spanish-speaking applicants share their positive experiences with friends. Creating a more inclusive environment for your customer base Hiring more Spanish speakers for your open hourly roles isn’t just about diversity and inclusivity at your workplace. Welcoming bilingual employees to your staff can also prove helpful for serving customers, providing support, and building relationships in the Hispanic community. Hiring managers must be intentional about creating inclusive work environments. By prioritizing how to attract Spanish-speaking applicants to your business, you also impact its sustainability. Adding bilingual employees to key positions across your company conveys a subtle message to the Hispanic community among your customer base. They feel seen, valued, and heard. In turn, your team will get to see things from a different viewpoint and understand another culture better. Building loyalty with the Hispanic community now can be lucrative for your business in the future. Developing a strategy to reach more Spanish-speaking applicants When opening new job positions and actively recruiting more hourly workers for your business, keep the needs of your Spanish-speaking applicants in mind. With its recent upgrade, Workstream makes it possible to recruit Spanish-speaking employees without manually translating everything yourself.

After all, hiring the right hourly employees can determine the success of your business. So, where can you find quality hourly employees? To help you kick off your recruiting strategy, here are six ways you can reach (more and quality) hourly job seekers. 1. Post on social media Today, it’s imperative that your company establishes and maintains an active social media presence. That’s because 72% of people use at least one form of social media. It not only reaches potential and current customers, but it also showcases your company’s culture to reel in prospective hourly employees. With that in mind, leveraging social media to advertise your job openings can help you reach a larger audience that falls within your target segment. At the very least, you'll be connecting with people who already know your brand and know what you're about. Search Facebook for Groups in your area. People in your local community come to these pages to share events, discuss pertinent issues, and even buy and sell their own products. By posting in these groups, you’re getting your job listing directly in front of potential workers in your geographical community. Twitter is another great platform you can use to find and hire quality candidates. Up to 58% of job seekers use Twitter in their job search. Most Twitter users range from ages 25-34 (28.9%) and 35-49 (28.2%), which means that you’d be sharing your job opening with a large pool of Millennials and Gen Xers. With plenty of features—like fast-trending hashtags, engaging with employees via retweets and quote tweets, or even searching for potential candidates through keywords—Twitter makes recruiting seamless and creative. If you're hoping to reach a younger demographic, consider TikTok . The majority of users on this trending platform are Gen Zs. TikTok serves bite-sized content that’s entertaining and educational, and is a great way for potential candidates to find out more about your organization and its culture. Most importantly, if you're using online channels to recruit, make the experience easy for your applicants. Most people today use smartphones to look for jobs, so optimize your job posting for the mobile experience. 2. Don't neglect your community Hourly job seekers often prioritize jobs that are in close proximity to their homes. To let them know you’re hiring, place signs outside your storefront. This works especially well if you position your sign toward the high-traffic side of your restaurant. If you’re looking to elevate the experience, consider using text-to-apply posters , which make it easy for potential candidates to find out more information about your available positions. By scanning the QR code or texting the number on the poster, they can jump straight to all your job listings. See how Cinnabon uses Workstream’s text-to-apply poster to reach more prospective applicants. Another method worth considering is placing advertisements in public library bulletin boards and your local newspaper. This allows you to reach broader groups of active job seekers at once. 3. Use online job boards Online job sites like Indeed and Craigslist are great for advertising your job listings. These job boards are visited by thousands of active job seekers on a daily basis. And, if you’re looking to broaden your reach—consider broadening the job boards you post to. With Workstream, you can post your job listings to 14 job boards at once and view all applicants within a single dashboard. This streamlines the entire recruiting process, and saves you from the hassle of copying and pasting job descriptions across multiple job boards. 4. Ask for referrals If you are giving thanks to your employees and have a great relationship with them, employee referrals are one of the best ways to source for quality employees. Chances are that your valued employee knows someone who shares their same worth ethic and hence, will be able to recommend someone that is the right fit for the job opening. In fact, Harvard Business Review found that referrals generated 70% more good hires than non-referrals, for every 100 applicants. What’s more, the retention rate of these referred employees is at a high of 46% , reducing the costs and effort needed to look for new employees. You can also choose to incentivize your employees to get more referrals. To ensure that the recommended hires are the right fit, you can opt to make rewards payable only after the new hire has successfully completed the probationary period. 5. Tap into educational institutions High schools, colleges and universities are brimming with potential hourly workers that are often seeking jobs during their term break to earn extra cash. To reach out to this candidate pool, contact school administrators to post job ads on campus or online boards. 6. Spruce up your job posts and recruiting solutions Making your job posts stand out is another effective recruiting solution. When more people are intrigued enough to click on your job posting, it automatically increases the chances of them applying for the role. Consider creative job postings in different forms. This could include hiring parties, monthly newsletters or even recruiting webinars. Text messaging recruiting is another way to optimize your recruiting strategy. Not only does it help reduce ghosting, it will also help in elevating a candidate's recruitment experience with the increasing preference for mobile text notifications and willingness to be contacted via text.
