They focus on engaging their salaried employees, as they usually put more time and effort into finding, hiring, and training them. The same holds true for hourly manufacturing workers. Manufactured workers include welders, technicians, engineers, assemblers, and much more. What managers often don't realize is that hourly workers are the backbone of the business—the ones bearing the brunt of heavy labor, in charge of completing most of the daily tasks, and responsible for providing excellent customer experiences. And with approximately 15 million manufacturing workers employed in 2019 , that’s a significant chunk of the population that’s often overlooked and unappreciated. One way to keep your manufacturing workers fulfilled is to keep them engaged. Employee engagement is key to decreasing turnover, motivating staff, and keeping operations running smoothly . Here's what you can do to effectively engage your hourly manufacturing workers and make them a part of your team. Give them a sense of purpose When your hourly manufacturing employees have a sense of purpose in your organization, they will go above and beyond their assigned tasks to turn your company into a successful one. They will want to contribute more in order to feel meaningful and for you to recognize their efforts. How can you make their work meaningful? Through clear and effective communication. Communicate with all your manufacturing employees professionally yet in a friendly manner, because you're all partners working towards a common goal. There was a study by Gallup on factory worker motivation that showed that hourly workers in a factory don't really care about the organizational mission, but rather about giving back to the community. If you could communicate to them how their work can contribute to the community, you could motivate them better and significantly increase their engagement. Build meaningful relationships Building strong relationships with your hourly workers is a fantastic way to increase their engagement and retention. When they see you as a friend rather than merely a manager, they will definitely perform much better. Strong working relationships also foster company loyalty— workers in a factory who feel part of the community are more motivated to stay on, regardless of whether they get a better offer or another opportunity to work elsewhere. It's crucial that you create enjoyable experiences so that they feel great when they clock in and build products. Friendly relationships are your best bet for achieving that. What's also very important is being available to them. Being there are crucial moments when they need you is what will show them that you care and value them. One step in the right direction is to also keep them in the loop on issues that will directly impact them. Keep them updated, just like you do with your salaried employees, and they will start seeing you as a partner and a friend. It will boost their morale and create a wonderful workplace culture that they will not want to leave. Involve them in Problem-Solving Processes It's a very common practice among business owners and managers to ask their salaried employees for help when coming up with solutions to various problems and creating a company strategy. That's completely normal, as they are often knowledge workers with plenty of experience and expertise regarding various business-related issues. However, this doesn't mean that you should overlook hourly employees and the strengths they have to offer. Perhaps some of them have a groundbreaking solution to a particular problem. After all, they are the ones engaging in numerous day-to-day operations or at the heart of your manufacturing processes, so they most likely have first-hand information regarding improvements that need to be made or concerns that need to be addressed. That's precisely why you should give them a seat at the table. Tap into their knowledge and really hear what they have to say. Give them a chance to really be a part of your team and introduce some change in your organization, the change that they’ve already brought about on their level. Their hands-on experience may just be what your company has needed all along. Including them in your strategizing process will give them a sense of purpose and motivate them to continue contributing to your company. Another study by Gallup on hourly vs. salaried workers' job satisfaction shows that 46% of hourly workers are satisfied with recognition for work accomplishments. So give the recognition that’s due them for their hard work and their invaluable contributions to your problem-solving process. Open the Door to Promotions If your manufacturing workers don't have an opportunity to grow in your company and actually build a career, chances are they will simply leave you after a certain period of time. If you don't allow them to grow, they'll find a place where they can. The aforementioned Gallup study on job satisfaction of hourly and salaried workers also shows that only 35% of hourly workers are satisfied with opportunities for promotion . With this statistic in mind, make sure each and every hourly worker has a chance to build a future at your company. Some may have completely different career aspirations and your company is only a stepping stone towards their goals, but it may not be the case with all of them. Take the time to talk to them and find out who would like to build an in-house career. Once you know that, lead them on a path to promotion. That's a very good incentive that can lead to lifetime loyalty and considerably improve your entire organization. If you only focus on investing time and effort into your salaried workers and disregard your hourly employees and their needs, your company may never reach the level of engagement you're looking for. Only when you fully recognize your hourly workers as valuable contributors to your company's success, as they definitely are, will you be able to truly grow.

In the US, states like New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey will be banning gatherings of over 50 people , while states like Ohio and California will close bars and restaurants. In other parts of the world, countries like Malaysia and Germany have closed their borders, and Switzerland has declared a state of emergency . On the individual level, these conditions have sparked a fear of food shortage among global citizens and many have begun panic buying . It is difficult to stay positive in this kind of situation, but despite restaurants taking a heavy hit to their business, such as suspensions of operations , many of them have chipped in to help make things a little better. Here are heartwarming moments where restaurants around the world helped boost the morale of healthcare workers at the frontline of the war against coronavirus: Singapore OK Chicken Rice Owner of OK Chicken Rice , Daniel Tan, took the initiative to deliver free meals to healthcare workers as an “encouragement of love,” after reports of nurses being ostracized on public transport for wearing their uniforms during this outbreak period surfaced online. Meanwhile, his wife started “Cheer Up,” an online campaign to raise money to fund the production and delivery of packs of food to healthcare workers. As of February 25, about US$18,310.96 (SG$26,000) was raised and about 1,200 packs of food were delivered . Carrara Cafe Despite a reduction in the number of walk-in orders, the cafe still decided to offer 80 cups of gelato for free to medical workers . In addition, should medical workers purchase a main dish at their cafe from now till the end of April, they will get an additional free scoop of gelato. The Philippines McDonald’s The fast food giant has expressed their support for healthcare workers and sent free food and drinks to V. Luna Medical Center in Quezon City. McDonald’s Philippines said that they will be reaching out to more hospitals during this period. Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf gave healthcare workers of St. Luke’s Medical Center a “ caring cup ” which can be used to collect a free cup of coffee! The hospital responded with a Facebook message to thank the cafe franchise for its “kindness and solidarity.” USA My Sister’s Fault The bakery and restaurant from Delaware announced that they will be providing school-age children with free meals from Wednesdays to Fridays for two weeks. This came after Delaware declared a state of emergency and closed schools, cutting off children’s access to school lunches. Sugar Street Bakery & Bistro This restaurant from Southeast Portland is offering food to children as well as families in need . At least 1,500 meals have been prepared for the purpose of being distributed to those in need. South Korea SPC Group SPC Group, a South Korean conglomerate that owns established franchises such as Paris Croissant, Paris Baguette, and Caffè Pascucci, has said that it will be donating bread and water for a month to Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. Furthermore, the group also donated US$32,380.80 (₩ 40,000,000) worth of “Happy Points” to children in low-income households in those provinces to help them get through the extended school holidays. The points can be used like cash in any of SPC’s food franchises . These include Paris Baguette, Baskin Robbins, Dunkin’, and the Pascucci coffee chain. During this period when all our news channels and social media feeds are dominated by stories of hardship and sickness, it’s great to read about these acts of kindness. They may seem small in the face of the global coronavirus crisis , but hopefully more people will be inspired to help others in this time of need.

This unfortunate circumstance has forced many to take drastic measures in hopes of keeping their business afloat, though not all have been successful in doing so. As one would expect, our quick service restaurants (QSRs) have not been spared from the aftermath of this pandemic. In fact, they may be one of the hardest hit industries. Amongst others, NPC International Inc., one of the franchisees for Pizza Hut & Wendy’s, and TooJay’s have filed for bankruptcy due to the direct impacts of the virus. Despite the seemingly bleak future, a select few QSRs have actually managed to thrive through this pandemic with their own innovative approaches (which we believe is a key element in ensuring your business survives this difficult period). Let’s take a look at Carl’s Jr. who, for one, has their fair share of effective solutions in keeping their business afloat and is thriving despite the crisis. Needless to say, we can definitely learn a thing or two from one of the most beloved global fast food chains. Before we dive deeper into their approaches, here’s an overview of what they have done to keep their business going: 1. Consumer-driven Innovation 2. Continue to Invest in Hiring the Right People 3. Building Strong Partnerships 4. Adopt a Data-Driven Approach 5. Focus on Execution Nuances of Sales Strategies Consumer-driven Innovation In recent years, consumers have been leaning towards meat-free products, with at least 30% of Americans reducing their total meat consumption. With this shift in consumer preferences, the plant-based meat market is predicted to be increasingly lucrative in the upcoming years. Carl’s Jr. caught on to this particular trend and became one of the first movers to roll out their own plant-based menu in 2019. Along with sister chain, Hardee’s, they partnered up with Beyond Meat to produce a meat-free menu and have been consistently updating it to meet increasing demands of consumers. And the best part? These vegan patties are customized to ensure that the brand’s unique taste is not compromised. This move proved to be successful. After only 10 months since its launch, the brand had managed to sell more than 4.5 million of their Beyond Famous Star burgers, making it their most successful burger launch in the last 2 years. One thing’s for sure - this group of consumers is not going away, and Carl’s Jr. definitely has no plans of slowing down this particular section of their menu. Aside from that, due to increased demand, Carl’s Jr. also rolled out an All-Natural Turkey Burger back in 2015 and keto-friendly options earlier this year. They even introduced a Carl’s Jr. menu which helps in curing hangovers back in February when the entire state was probably overindulging during the NFL Super Bowl! That, to us, is the perfect testament to how heavily consumer-driven their food innovations are. Continue to Invest in Hiring the Right People As Chick-fil-A owner/operator, Dusty Pyne, said, “We aren’t in the restaurant business - we’re in the people business.” The same holds true for Carl’s Jr. as well. Even with the setbacks they have experienced due to the coronavirus, they insist on taking their hiring processes seriously. Since customer service is of utmost importance to them, they prioritize relevant characteristics of new hires to ensure they are able to deliver top-notch services to their customers. With the pandemic crisis, it will undoubtedly be more difficult to hire the right people. To overcome this, Carl’s Jr. utilizes new technology from Workstream to enhance their hiring process. They were the first to incorporate a 30-second video submission in their recruitment process to understand their candidates better. In this video, applicants were asked open-ended questions (e.g. ‘Why do you want to work for Carl's Jr. and this specific position?’) and recruiters have the opportunity to analyze how applicants articulate their thoughts to others. Such segments allow them to make an informed decision on who they should invite for an interview, making the process to hire the right people more efficient despite the outbreak. If you would like to adopt similar hiring styles, feel free to contact us at Workstream. Having worked with over 5000 hiring managers, our experienced hiring specialists will gladly provide free expert consultations on how to improve your hiring process! Building Strong Partnerships Another strategy that Carl’s Jr. has done right is establishing strong partnerships with innovative companies. Especially in light of the pandemic, building partnerships with the right businesses are essential to keep their operations going. And this is exactly what Carl’s’ Jr. had done - initiating a partnership with the industry leader of food delivery, Postmates. To celebrate their 79th birthday , Carl’s Jr. presented their customers with ‘free gifts’ when they placed their order via Postmates during said birthday weekend. This is a great strategy, mainly because most consumers have significantly increased their usage of delivery services during the crisis in a bid to avoid leaving home. In addition to that, Carl’s Jr. also provides free delivery when customers order through Postmates and UberEats. This is made possible only with strong partnerships established between the delivery services and themselves. Our advice to you? As a business owner, it is best that you keep effective and relevant collaborations in mind whenever an unprecedented situation occurs. Adopt a Data-Driven Approach Some of us may be familiar with this - Carl’s Jr. was once (or still) known for their racy ads , showcasing women in scantily clad clothings. While we don't advocate these controversial ads (that are arguably offensive), one cannot deny that these ads made waves. It had 2.5 billion earned media impressions before it even ran as a Super Bowl commercial. The brand was well-aware of the statistics - these ads were memorable, and they stuck with consumers. Nevertheless, criticisms from the general public after the “#MeToo” movement and evolving societal expectations have pushed them to steer away from the raunchy image they have developed for themselves over the years. Instead, they have moved to placing focus on their foods , since that is what’s driving their profits anyway. Our main takeaway here is to utilize your data to establish your brand and determine your next marketing campaign. It ensures you stay relevant in the industry and more importantly, prevents backlash from your own pool of consumers. Focus on Nuances of Sales Strategy Execution Just like how Carl’s Jr. led the way in suggestive selling at drive-thrus, franchisees should focus on the execution nuances of their sales strategies. According to data collected, Carl’s Jr. leads all QSR brands in degree of cross-selling and upselling during their greeting in drive-thrus. With such suggestive selling (also commonly known as cross-selling and up-selling), average order values are bound to increase. Needless to say, as consumption patterns shift towards delivery and drive-thru purchases amidst the coronavirus outbreak, QSRs have more to gain when they emulate such approaches by Carl’s Jr. The key takeaway here is this: avoid simply rolling out a generic strategy. Make sure you manage the execution of it, down to how each employee carries it out during day-to-day operations. All QSRs institutionalize suggestive selling amongst employees, but Carl’s Jr.'s execution gave them the edge to thrive, especially during this pandemic. By constantly innovating and staying abreast with technology, while understanding their consumers’ needs and demands, Carl’s Jr. was able to survive through, and is still surviving, the pandemic. These approaches could perhaps be the pivotal solution for your company to weather the storm during this crisis. What are your plans to keep your business going during this period?

By implementing Workstream's automated hiring processes, Pieology tripled its applicant pool in just one week, hiring over 700 applicants. \"One of my managers told me the other day, 'With Workstream, my hiring organizes itself. It's a dream!' It was then I knew we had made the right choice in partnering with Workstream on this crucial part of our business.\" Tara Lindstrom VP of Marketing and Human Resources of Hundal Companies The problem Managers can't hire fast enough About Culver's Pieology, founded in 2011, revolutionized the pizza industry with its customizable, fast-casual model. The brand allows customers to craft their own pizzas, choosing from a variety of fresh ingredients. Pieology's commitment to innovation and quality has led to its widespread popularity, establishing a lasting legacy in the competitive pizza market. Locations: 140 Industry: Restaurant Hundal Companies is a family-owned franchise company headquartered in Livermore, California. They have 3 brands — Jamba Juice, Carl's Jr., and Pieology Pizzeria — across 50 locations throughout California and Utah. The Pieology franchises held by Hundal Companies improved their hiring practices by posting job openings efficiently and processing applications faster. For the Pieology brand, having fully staffed restaurants is especially important. Employees guide customers from start to finish in crafting their perfect pizza. As such, they are the face of the brand and are a huge factor in the customer’s overall experience in their store. It takes a lot of employees to keep pizzas flowing smoothly through the line, and because of this Pieology has to hire a lot of people to make sure they are always adequately staffed. Hiring is by far their top challenge. One of the issues they face is recruiting qualified applicants quickly before they sign on for another position elsewhere. Pieology's managers do all their own hiring, but they are often working the line as well, so they are unable to get back to the applicants right away. Once they do, it can be a game of phone tag. And managers often have to use their personal phones to text applicants since younger applicants don't check email as often The manual interviewing and hiring process they had was time-consuming, tedious, and not getting the desired results.

Once they do, it can be a game of phone tag - and they often have to use their personal phones to text applicants since most younger applicants do not check email anymore. The manual interviewing and hiring process they had was time-consuming, tedious, and not getting the desired results. The solution Automation accelerates the hiring process The hiring team at Hundal Companies knew they needed to empower their hiring managers with the technology to make hiring more efficient and effective. With Workstream's HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform, they were able to automate tedious hiring tasks and attract more applicants than ever before. Job board integration With Workstream's job board integrations , Hundal Companies is now able to post to over 2,500+ job boards at once. These other job boards include Indeed, Glassdoor, Facebook and even supporting text-to-apply and scan-to-apply features, which makes it exponentially more convenient for applicants to send in their applications. Smart screening Using Workstream, Hundal Companies created custom screening quizzes, enabling them to automatically surface the best applicants and filter out those that aren't qualified. Managers no longer needed to manually sift through applications or manually not applicant qualifications. Automated self-scheduling Workstream eliminated the complicated process of setting up calendars and sieving through slots that are available for an interview through the use of automated scheduling . We can also be integrated with your personal calendar to make the process even easier. 2-way texting Workstream made communication between employers and applicants easier via automated text messages . It is easier for both employers and applicants to schedule, postpone, and cancel interviews. By providing such a convenient communication process, applicants are now more inclined to inform them when they can no longer make it for interviews. 3X increase in applicant pool in one week 40 job ads posted on multiple job boards Built for the hourly workforce Building a better workforce through smarter hiring By partnering with Workstream, Hundal Companies was able to triple their applicant pool in just one week, hiring over 700 applicants in a shorter period of time. Additionally, they were able to efficiently post over 40 job ads utilizing Workstream's seamless integration with multiple job boards .

Simple is hard.\" At Workstream , we are able to work hand in hand with many brands who face issues of hiring and help them streamline their entire hiring process . Today, we have the privilege to chat with one of our Product Champions, Tara Lindstrom , Vice President of Marketing for their family-owned franchise company. Tara plays an active role in HR and Recruiting as well. Lydia (L): What does your typical day look like? Tara (T): Being in the restaurant business is a mix of thoughtful planning and execution, and fighting fires. I always adjust based on the needs of our restaurant teams. They are my first priority because if they can’t do their job, I don’t have a job. L: What is your process for getting feedback from your team? T: We hold weekly calls with each of our brands to cover a variety of topics. They know we have an open door policy all the time, but we actively request feedback on the calls. L: Do you have any advice for startups that are building products for hourly workers? T: Think like you are working with and talking to 12 year olds. Really. Many hourly workers and even managers have a very low education level or their first language is not English. Each company is only as strong as its weakest link, so aim your offerings towards them. Also, share best practices between companies because we are all in the same boat. If your startup can share this knowledge you will be more valuable to each of your clients. L: Are there any trends that excite you? T: Plant-Based/Vegan eating, using more natural ingredients, redefining the “fast food” and fast casual landscape of restaurants. L: What’s your typical interview process? T: In our stores, team members are usually interviewed first by a qualified shift lead, then our manager does a second interview to approve. For shift leads and assistant managers, our general managers do all the interviewing and hiring, with approval from their district manager. For managers, the district manager interviews 1-2 times and then goes to the director of operations or VP operations for a final interview. L: What do you look for in an applicant? T: Availability and personality. We can train the rest. L: What are common mistakes people make in the hiring process? T: Not going with their gut feeling. If you just have a feeling that someone is not a good fit, don’t hire them, because you are usually right. Also, holding onto bad hires too long. If they don’t prove themselves a good employee within the first 2-3 shifts, cut ties before it becomes an HR nightmare. L: What tools / services do you use to improve productivity? T: We communicate with our teams on GroupMe, we have a good HRIS, and Workstream has really improved the productivity of our managers in the hiring process because they don’t have to go back and forth with someone 6 times to schedule an interview. L: Do you have any books you recommend to people in your industry? T: The One Minute Manager. Setting the gold standard. L: How do you think restaurants will look in 10 years? What will be the biggest changes? T: I think for fast food and fast casual there will be no cashiers. It’s more efficient and reliable to have a kiosk take orders, payments, and suggestive sell. I also truly hope there are more actual healthful items available on EVERY menu in America. I believe we will see a lot more plant-based, locally sourced, healthier dishes. L: Is there any data about the restaurant industry that shocked you? T: Nothing shocks me in this industry 😊 L: What quote / mantra inspires you? T: How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. And The restaurant business is simple. Simple is hard. L: Do you have any advice for new restaurant owners/operators? T: I think too many new restaurant owners and operators worry about the details of getting the store open.

If you are not training, then you are neglecting half the job.” - the late Thomas J. Watson, former Chairman and CEO of IBM. Like Watson, many leaders have repeatedly emphasized the importance of a new hire training program and training new employees, along with the value it brings to a company. In fact, not training new employees could bring more harm to the organization than good, even when it comes to hourly workers. Research has shown that the primary reason for employees leaving a company is the lack of growth, development opportunities, and advancements in their job positions. Needless to say, the high turnover rate that comes after is bound to incur additional costs for the company, and they are not as insignificant as they seem. To put things into perspective, the cost of hiring someone can be as high as 30% of the job’s salary. That is around $12,000 for an employee who makes $40,000 a year! With that in mind, we know how important it is to include a new hire training program in the process of onboarding hourly workers in order to retain them. Thus, we have gathered some tips for training new employees in this article. Read on to find out how to build an effective new employee training program! What Is a New Hire Trainer? New hire training is an integral part of the onboarding process, designed to get newcomers up to speed and accustomed to their new role and job duties. The ultimate goal? To improve retention rates, create a harmonious team atmosphere, and facilitate productivity. Typically, a new hire training program is meticulously crafted by human resources, in collaboration with relevant department heads, to meet specific training needs. During this time, new hires can expect to experience a mix of training sessions. We're talking one-on-one conversations, online courses—like those you might find on LinkedIn—and even quizzes to evaluate the trainees' understanding and check in on their progress. This training plan can come in various formats and training methods—online training, shadowing more experienced team members, or even role-specific training like using particular software. It's vital for team leaders and HR to check in with new hires regularly, especially during their first week, to ensure that they understand the company culture and are aligning with it. Training materials should be updated and could include a variety of resources from FAQs to video tutorials. Bear in mind that the new hire training program should be tailored to the learners, especially when there's a diverse range of job descriptions in your big, mid, or small business. At the end of the day, the effectiveness of your new employee training program can make or break the transition into the new job. So, make it count. The Importance of Training New Employees Did you know that rehiring costs can make up approximately 12% of a company’s expenses, with it going up to 40% for those with a high turnover rate? It’s true. But simply providing training for your new and current employees can mitigate these costs. Furthermore, it takes up far less time as compared to recruiting new hires for the job. However, these exorbitant costs that come from rehiring are not the only reason that makes the training of new employees important. Investing in employee training also leads to better returns for the company as employees can work smarter and more efficiently. In turn, they can complete more tasks at a given time. And considering that you are paying them by the hour, it will undoubtedly give you the most bang for your buck! Companies that invest $1,500 on training per employee saw an average of 24% more profit than companies that did not. As Richard Branson said, “Take care of your employees, and they will take care of your business”. By constantly working on employee engagement through the provision of training, your employees will naturally become loyal to your brand. As the needs of your employees are satisfied, they will increasingly find value in working in your company and striving towards your organization’s goals. In turn, you will notice higher customer satisfaction and production standards as a result of your training efforts. Remote New Hire Training The coronavirus pandemic brought about a new normal in 2020, from social distancing measures to the digitization of, well, everything. Inevitably, the usual onboarding process was altered to meet the new societal standards. Employee training, in particular, was no longer allowed to be organized in huge batches, and companies are encouraged to move them online as much as possible. This is where remote employee training played a crucial role when training new hires. While remote training was essential in the 2020 pandemic climate, there’s no denying the challenges that come with its usage. For one, it is probably not the most conducive way to communicate due to technical challenges or even distractions from remote environments. Moreover, the lack of personal interaction may pose a problem as new hires might find it difficult to clarify their questions online. Thus, finding the most optimal way to conduct your training is imperative to make sure that it meets the objectives of your company. To ensure a smooth onboarding experience for your new employees, consider harnessing digital tools that can relay information in the least troublesome way. As hourly workers mostly only require general knowledge about the company as well as details about their job scope, a platform that facilitates virtual learning dynamically will be best to engage the attention of the new hires. Additionally, check that communication platforms are well established between the managers and the new employees so that they can clarify their doubts easily. At Workstream, we kickstart your mobile training by automating text messages to your new employees once they are hired. This message contains essential items such as your onboarding handbook , checklists, and employee training videos and it allows them to be equipped with the basic knowledge of their position before their first day of work. Not only will it help them smoothly transition into their role, but they will also be able to access these resources anytime and anywhere. The popular fast-food franchise, McDonald’s, has adopted this approach and it’s proven to make their hiring process so much more efficient. We help you manage the dissemination of information vital to your onboarding so that you can focus on the other aspects of your hiring process. To see how we can best meet your needs, schedule a time with our hiring experts today! Tips for Training New Employees Establishing a new hire training program may sound like an arduous task. But doing it right can bring your company a long way. To ensure that your training is effective, consider following the tips below when developing your training program. Communicate with your newly hired employees before their first day of work Just like how Workstream makes onboarding easier for our clients’ new employees, communicating with your new hires before their first day of work is essential to ensure that they are prepared to fulfill their job tasks and responsibilities. And this applies to both remote and physical training. Some of the information that could be imparted may include a brief description of their job responsibilities, employee handbook, and training videos, as well as the expectations they have to meet as an employee of their company. By doing this, you can manage the expectations of the employee before they start their work properly. Moreover, it helps in making them feel more prepared, while at the same time keeping the staff involved in their training more organized and efficient. Peer training Most often than not, current employees can give a more comprehensive overview of the tasks at hand since they have firsthand experience in the position. As such, consider incorporating peer training into your onboarding process - it might just help your new hire work more efficiently after learning the tips and tricks from your current employee. If you are in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) industry, for example, you may want to let your new employee shadow your best servers to observe how they go about their responsibilities. Hands-on training As hourly positions usually involve a lot of physical duties, providing training that is engaging and on-the-job, such as hands-on training, will be an effective way to train your new hires. By observing how a certain task is done and emulating them after, they are better able to get used to their job at hand. This especially applies to positions that require the usage of new technology. Apply the 10-min rule When going through vital information with your new employees, it is important to keep them engaged to ensure that you have their attention, especially when it is in a remote setting. Grosskopf, the author of the book “Awake Leadership”, advises hiring managers to break up these informative sessions and ask questions after every 10 minutes or so. Additionally, you may want to gather input from your trainees on the pace of your training to make sure that they can keep up with your content. Onboarding your new employees right is just as important as training them.

New Hire Training Checklist by Industry We know training new employees can get tedious and messy sometimes. And we understand your frustrations!

The highest minimum wage in the US overall goes to Washington D.C. which has eclipsed the $17.00 mark! The highest minimum wage state however is Washington which is currently $16.28 per hour. Now states and big cities like New York City and Seattle can have their minimum wage laws, but businesses have control over how much higher they go past the minimum. Case in point, Hobby Lobby increased its to $18.50 per hour . How does the minimum wage work in the US The United States has a diverse economic landscape in which the federal minimum wage sets a baseline for the entire country. However, individual states have the authority to establish their own minimum wage laws , often surpassing the federal standard. However, there are states where the minimum wage remains lower than the national baseline. The federal and state-level minimum wage rates have been a contentious issue in America for decades, and employers, employees, and politicians all seem to have varying opinions on whether a higher minimum wage would be good for workers or not. On one hand, the cost of living has continued to increase each year while wages have remained stagnant. According to Investopedia, a family of four living on the federal minimum wage would fall well below the poverty line , which is $26,200 for the 48 contiguous states. And while the highest minimum wages in the U.S. generally belong to Washington , California , and Massachusetts ; the cost of living is also high in those states to justify the rates. On the other hand, the argument for a lower minimum wage is that a family was never actually meant to live off of this wage . Rather, the federal minimum wage is mostly for teens finding their first jobs, or those working supplemental jobs in addition to their main gigs. Raising the minimum may lead to employers not being able to offer new jobs, and for automation to push low-skilled workers out of the workforce completely. And of course, the federal minimum wage is a much more acceptable hourly rate in lower-cost areas of the U.S. Whichever side a business owner falls on, at the end of the day, there are two main considerations to keep in mind when determining the hourly rate you pay to your employees: 1) the actual law, and 2) the law of the market. Lucky for you, Workstream has created an hourly wage index tool that answers the ever stress-inducing question: how much should you pay your hourly workers? Which states have the highest minimum wages ? We already mentioned that Washington state wears the crown for the highest minimum wage in the US at $17 an hour. California is another state that boasts one of the highest minimum wages in the nation which is currently set at $14 per hour. The state has been at the forefront of the fight for workers' rights, and this commitment is reflected in its minimum wage policy. The high cost of living in many parts of California , particularly in major metropolitan areas, has been a driving force behind the push for a more substantial minimum wage to ensure that workers can meet their basic needs. Massachusetts rounds out the trio of states with high minimum wages, currently set at $13.50 per hour. The state has a history of prioritizing workers' rights, and the minimum wage reflects a commitment to providing fair compensation. Massachusetts has also implemented legislation to gradually increase the minimum wage over time, addressing concerns about income inequality and the rising cost of living in the state. These states' decisions to set higher minimum wages are part of a broader national conversation about income inequality and the need for fair compensation. While critics argue that higher minimum wages could lead to job losses or increased costs for businesses, proponents emphasize the importance of ensuring that all workers earn a living wage . As these states continue to grapple with economic challenges and social justice issues, the debate over minimum wage policies remains a central aspect of shaping the future of labor in the United States. Which states have the lowest minimum wages? One such state is Wyoming, where the minimum wage is set at the federal level of $7.25 per hour. Despite the state's relatively low cost of living , this minimum wage can present challenges for workers trying to make ends meet, particularly in areas with higher living costs. Wyoming's economic dependence on industries like agriculture and mining may contribute to the resistance in raising the minimum wage to levels seen in other states. Georgia maintains a minimum wage of $5.15 per hour, though most workers in the state are covered by the federal minimum wage . Georgia 's approach to the minimum wage reflects a combination of economic factors and political ideologies, where concerns about potential job losses due to wage hikes are weighed against the necessity of providing a living wage for workers. In Alabama , the minimum wage is also set at $7.25 per hour. The state's economic landscape, characterized by a mix of industries including manufacturing, finance, and healthcare , has contributed to the decision to align with the federal minimum wage . The debate over minimum wage policy in Alabama reflects broader discussions about economic inequality and the balance between fostering business growth and ensuring fair wages for workers. While these states currently have lower minimum wage rates , the broader national conversation about income inequality and the push for a higher federal minimum wage continues. Advocates argue that a living wage is essential for workers to meet basic needs, while opponents express concerns about potential job losses and the impact on small businesses . As the economic landscape evolves, the minimum wage debate remains a crucial aspect of shaping labor policies across the United States. Federal and state minimum wage laws The federal minimum wage for nonexempt employees is $7.25 per hour, and to stay in line with the law, a business cannot pay any non-exempt employee lower than this rate. Exempt employees (for example, restaurant workers who earn tips) can make under this rate, but their average hourly income including tips must come out to $7.25 per hour or more. The ultimate authority on the federal minimum wage is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor . Whether it’s a small business or one of the large employers , the FLSA applies to all. Using the hourly wage index will help clear up any confusion on how much to pay your employees. On the state level, over half of the states require businesses to pay more than the federal minimum, while other states at least meet the federal minimum, though they may have a lower rate that would solely apply to employers and employees that are not covered by the FLSA. Examples of such employees include commission-based employees (e.g. auto sales), taxi drivers, farm workers, and live-in domestic service workers. The law of the market The minimum wage is simply that: the minimum wage allowed by law. However, there is the law of the market that may be what truly defines what a business should pay in different cities and states, leading many organizations to compete for offering the highest minimum wage . As mentioned above, Hobby Lobby is setting its own “minimum wage” at $18.50 an hour, which is more than double the federal rate, and also higher than the state-level minimum of many of the states they operate in. This is one of the highest minimum wages in the U.S. and raises the baseline wages far above the minimum for job seekers in the area. Businesses in competitive states like New Jersey , Oregon , and Florida have been far outpacing the federal minimum wage to attract more talent. Amazon, for example, had set its minimum wage to $19 per hour, making it another company offering one of the highest minimum wages in the U.S. As the economy recovers, we expect hourly rates in most competitive cities to lean toward $15 and up, even if the federal minimum wage doesn’t change. Hiring at lower rates than this may be difficult, so employers must reassess how much they can afford to pay to attract the best talent.

We knew that we had to ask CEO Evelyn Scalora to share her advice and experience in the food industry's hiring practices. Tin Pot Creamery started as an ice cream of the month club in 2012. After about a year of delivering ice cream to customers in the Bay Area, Tin Pot opened its first brick and mortar store in Palo Alto. Now, Tin Pot has several scoop shops scattered across the Bay Area. The team at Tin Pot Creamery hand-makes ice creams, toppings, sauces, mix-ins and baked goods every day. The menu changes seasonally and there is a strong emphasis on organic and local ingredients. Tin Pot has an innovative take on all flavors, from the classic to creative and new ones. Their mix-ins made in their own bakery, with organic dairy, and the finest locally sourced ingredients including: TCHO chocolate, fruit from Oya Organic Farm, O Olive Oil, Mighty Leaf Tea, and honey from Bay Area Bee Company. This makes their products one of a kind. Evelyn spent 7.5 years at Jamba, launching the brand in Asia Pacific and the Middle East. She tells us that she has always had the belief that people should have access to real, whole foods. On top of that, these should taste amazing and provide nourishment to the body, \"because that is one the great joys of life\". She has spent her entire career in the natural food and health and wellness industries, driven by a passion to create brands that improve lives as well as spark joy. Q: What have your experiences been with hiring hourly workers? Evelyn: Up until recently, the hiring of hourly workers has been rather laborious and often chaotic. While there are so many new candidate/job posting search engines, there have been few solutions to manage candidates through the hiring process once they submit a job application. With the hourly jobless rate at an all-time low, it has been critical to find ways to speed up the application process and automate candidate engagement flow using current media in order to prevent the loss of a candidate to another potential opportunity. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Job Board Integrations allow you to post to over 25,000 job boards with a single click, and view all applicants in a single dashboard. Not only does it save you the hassle of copying and pasting to multiple job boards, an in-built artificial intelligence system also optimizes your job posting, giving you access to as many as 10x more candidates. Furthermore, a streamlined feed also ensures that all hiring information can be viewed, accessed and processed within the same system. This effectively simplifies and automates the hiring process, allowing you to get in touch with candidates and process their applications as quickly as possible. Q: What has worked most for you when hiring hourly workers? Evelyn: It's important to consider the hiring experience from your target candidate's perspective. In the food service industry, turnover tends be high, while retention is low and there is low investment in the employer brand. Being able to engage with candidates to explain to them \"how working for your brand can help them achieve their goals\" is impactful. Often, social media is key in a meaningful in telling your brand story. Hiring events can also help you to connect with candidates. Q: Where are your go to channels for sourcing and hiring? Evelyn: We leverage job boards as much as possible because of the ease and flexibility they provide in reaching candidates. It's always important to make sure that the job board used is relevant to the target candidate, and that traffic and impression are as high as possible on the platform. Social networking and referrals are also key in our processing for finding qualified candidates. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: With data-driven analytics , you will be able to find out more information on candidates who are applying, which can be useful in optimizing the number of applications. These will also allow you to identify opportunities to reduce spend and even track which platforms provide the most long-term hires! Apart from tapping on relevant job boards, it is crucial that you make the application process convenient for candidates, which will increase their likelihood of applying. This can be done by implementing text-to-apply posters , which can be printed out and displayed at various locations. Visitors can then scan the QR code or text the number displayed, and be immediately guided to all open positions. Q: What innovative recruiting technologies or methods have you seen recently? Evelyn: Many in the food industry have used \"open houses\" with product tasting as an enticement for candidates to engage in their brand. For Tin Pot Creamery, this has worked well as everyone loves delicious ice cream. Interested in finding out how else you can improve the hiring process for your QSR? Schedule a chat with us!

He spent a lot of his childhood playing sports but dialed in on basketball and golf in high school, attended Santa Clara University and studied business. Out of college, he was a financial statement auditor and had the opportunity to audit many different companies across many different industries. At the time, work was not exciting but he did enjoy the interaction with the clients, and helping them with their needs. After 5 years, he wanted to start afresh and try to build a startup. He was fortunate enough to co-found two startups, Leap Transit and Harvst, and use the skills he had acquired in the auditing world to build the various components of each business. From there, he helped his wife open As Quoted , a health conscious cafe in San Francisco. Shortly after that, he was brought on as COO of Gordo Taqueria, a taqueria chain with outlets in San Francisco as well as throughout the Bay Area. He spent most of his time building the management team there, formalizing operations and processes, building hiring procedures and renegotiating prices for the inventory products. Gordo was a big accomplishment, as the business had not evolved in its 40-year history and restructuring the restaurant to remain competitive for the future was a large undertaking. Opportunities began to present themselves through his networks as well as his co-founder's, which led to the formation of Chu and Waters Consulting which is an arm of his father's CPA firm, Chu and Waters LLP. Through Chu and Water's Consulting, they were involved in IT outsourcing, government IT and finance projects, the entertainment industry and overall business consulting. While they still have a hand in the consulting business, he created Joy Tea in January 2019 with his co-founder Thomas Vo . At Joy Tea, Jeff and Thomas are producing Ready-To-Drink, CBD Infused Iced Tea. Q : What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Jeff: The most challenging moment in my career occurred at the very beginning. When I co-founded my first startup, I had just come off 5 years from auditing, with virtually no experience in tech. Over the next two years, we took a concept and brought it to life, through diligence, hard work and a little bit of luck. We were fortunate enough to get funded by some of the largest funds in the Valley and everything was headed in the right direction. In the end, the party stopped due to a fundamental issue that affects any company: culture. As founders, we were all young, had our own ideas on how the business should be run and over time developed severe communication issues internally. Communication became siloed and there was discomfort in communicating openly with one another. To me, the culture that had developed was one of secrecy and leveraging information to control people. The excitement of the moment, to build a company based off a radical new idea that was gaining traction and attention, was overwhelmed by the daily discomfort in the office and amongst my peers. When I ultimately split from the company, I spent a lot of time digesting what had happened and why. The only perspective I was capable of having during the moments within the company were the negative sensations that related to what was happening in front of my eyes. I rarely stepped back and took the macro perspective. Finally being able to reflect from that vantage point proved to be powerful in my development. Realizing that our team culture was the driving force for the dysfunction opened up my eyes. Although my experience within the company was by far the most challenging experience of my career, it was also the most rewarding. I'm grateful to have had this experience early on in my career, as the lessons learnt from it have only benefited me as I move forward. Culture is everything, and the direction from the CEO and the message he or she sends to the executive team and beyond truly effects the path of the entire organization. Every time. Period. I've since become infatuated with studying the different philosophies and styles of leadership across industries and professions. After experiencing how terrible it can be to work in a negative and manipulative work environment, I understand the importance of building a strong and positive culture that allows everyone within the organization to feel empowered. Q: How would you describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? Jeff: Culture is everything. For Joy, we first defined our core values: joy, compassion, humility, simplicity and innovation. These values are who we are, and what we believe in. Through how we define these terms and what they mean to us, we then use them to guide our decision making and dictate who we work with. Most importantly, we use them to create an ecosystem that fosters an environment where everyone on our team feels empowered to think creatively and take risks. Mistakes will be made and not everything will turn out like how we hope. But that is ok. Progress is made even through failure. Understanding that there is a lesson to be learned through every mistake is the positive and productive perspective we want. Having the confidence and encouragement of your managers and peers after a mistake creates an even stronger team member. It is the difference in feeling as if everyone on your team is with you, or everyone on your team is against you in a personally vulnerable moment. It is very easy to imagine the extreme differences in sensation, from feeling supported or criticized at that moment. We encourage our team members to get up, evaluate the situation that has occured, learn from it and try again. When there is success after failure, genuine confidence builds. That \"I can do this\" attitude starts to form and from there, that person’s capabilities begin to become limitless. Even more powerfully, that attitude becomes contagious. It is our hope that we, as a company, have this collective attitude towards anything we pursue. Our superpower is simple, difficult and rewarding. We communicate openly. Establishing a culture where open communication is not judged but seen as an opportunity to understand another’s perspective. This is crucial to how our team operates. The purpose of communicating openly is so that there is clarity in the moment, and everyone feels comfortable raising any topic or question without fear of judgement. We encourage questions and rebuttals because this brings clarity to all parties on any given topic. Our belief is that focusing on the problem at hand, leaving your ego at the door and speaking your mind to drive the best solutions. The hardest part is focusing on the problem at hand, leaving your ego at the door and speaking your mind. Bias, ego, competition, these are all qualities of being human. But when you cater to these feelings, you lose track of solving a problem and focus more on pushing a certain agenda. Communicating openly is beneficial in many ways. Individuals can have their opinions heard and taken seriously, which makes them feel like a part of the team. As a company, we get amazingly creative ideas tossed around and everyone can chime in and build off these ideas to create an even grander concept. In the end, its an idea built off an idea, built off an idea with 2, 3, 5…10 peoples’ input that led to that final solution. A solution that would have never been talked about had it been kept to the original source because they were too afraid or uncomfortable to speak up. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: People form the core of your company, which means that you should hire right in the first place. This can be done by screening and selecting applicants that gel well with your team. With customizable workflows and stages , you will be able to determine which candidates move along in the interview process, while also reviewing and recommending candidates. Add interview and training notes, to let your teammates find out what you think of the candidates, which prevents instances where you forget that mental note you made. Additionally, mobile training will ensure that all new hires (and existing employees) stay on track! By including your core values and key traits in the onboarding booklets, all staff will know what to expect in the company, and ideally follow suit. The ability to access these materials anytime, and anywhere will also help in encouraging employees to stay on track with their onboarding materials – while you may also review completion rates and program SMS reminders to be sent to guarantee completion. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Jeff: I had to do the most hiring when I was in the restaurant industry. It was a challenge to hire because there were and still are so many opportunities for those looking to work in the food service industry. San Francisco specifically, was challenging. Not only do we have to compete with all the local restaurants, but also the tech companies. Many tech companies have internal cafeterias with a set menu and regular hours. Many workers choose to work there as the stress is much lower and the benefits are amazing. When I realized how difficult it was becoming to hire employees, we started to focus intensely on how we could beef up what we could offer to potential employees. We started to offer above market wages, lay out the future expansion plans of the business to show career growth and become more vocal about our health benefits, amongst other things. The economy has turned into more of a two way street regarding the employee / employer relationship. And I love it. I think that if an employer can show an employee they care enough through taking the steps to 'sell' the job to an employee, you get a more appreciative employee. A more appreciative employee will care more about your business and that attitude is evident to your customers. So to me the challenge is that businesses have to do a lot more 'selling' to their potential employees. But again, I think it leads to a better outcome for all parties. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Set yourself apart from other QSRs, or tech companies by differentiating your hiring process! When you make it easy for candidates to apply, you’d naturally find more candidates signing up for the job opening. This is especially important if your company is unable to match the salary offering, or welfare provided by your competitors. Consider the use of text-to-apply posters , which allow visitors to scan the QR code or text the number displayed, to get a link to all open positions. Job board integrations are also critical in helping you to reach the masses, by posting to over 25,000 job boards with a single click. Getting candidates to send in video resumes is also a fun and exciting way to hire, and show them that your QSR is ahead of the trends! Not only does it make the interview process more interesting to the candidate, your hiring managers will also enjoy looking through said videos, instead of poring through hundreds of physical resumes. In terms of practicality, it is also an easy way to determine candidates who are genuinely interested in the position, automatically filtering out those who are only looking for a temporary job. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Jeff: I believe my job is to set the strategy for the organization that is in line with our values and will lead us towards the goals that we seek to achieve. From there, I evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of our personnel to bring that vision to life. I'm obsessive about leadership and building leaders. Therefore, I can be very strategic about putting people in a position where they can have success as well as grow. I firmly believe that if you help an individual grow in an area that is not historically a strong point for them, you are creating a more confident and well-rounded team member who can accomplish more for the company as they continue to develop. That sense of accomplishment in an area where it used to be a weakness, is what builds genuine confidence. I want people to surprise themselves with what they are capable of achieving with a little bit of a push from their team or manager. That individual will one day have someone under their wing and will inspire them to push their limits and have a break through. That ideology, that mindset, is what I want everyone on our team to have. Anything we think up can be possible, no matter how outrageous it may seem. Our ideas will not work out all the time but I want our team to feel confident in taking risks and being ok with making mistakes. Q: Who inspires you and why? Jeff: Steve Kerr. I don't think he gets as much credit as he should for the success that the Golden State Warriors have had. I think for most people, when they look at his situation they see a guy that has inherited an amazing team with amazing talent. From there he has built it into a historical team with historical talent. So when most sit back and view Kerr, I think a lot of people believe that if they were to coach that team with that much talent, then they too would have been able to win 3 championships in 4 years. I whole heartedly disagree. When Steve joined the team, he replaced Mark Jackson who was well=liked by the players and had achieved some success. Steve had to come in and win over the team, and also convince certain players to take on different roles that they were not accustomed to… and be ok with it. For example, Kerr saw that Andre Iguodala would be a better fit coming off the bench and leading the second unit. At that point, Iggy was an All Star who had started every game of his then 10 year career. Steve had one-on-one's with all the players during the off-season and was obviously able to communicate with Iggy such that he believed in Steve's vision and was willing to come off the bench in order for that vision to come to life. Nine months later they win the Chip. But the most impressive part of Steve's tenure is the consistency and flexibility that he displays. Now GSW has more All Stars than they know what to do with and are a highly sought after team to come play for. This is in large part to the culture that Steve Kerr has developed. Steve understands his role as coach of GSW. How much can he really coach up a Steph Curry or a Kevin Durant at this point? How do you convince a historically great team that has won 3 titles in the last 4 years to continue to maintain that drive to be better and not have egos and personalities that start to clash? It ain't easy. That's why I believe the magic of Steve Kerr is that he constantly seems to understand what his team needs from him. Even if those needs are changing and are outside of what you would typically think a coaches job is. Steve likes to interject humor into film study to keep the content engaging as well as soften the mood. If there has been heavy travel or his guys just seem tired in general, Steve is known to cancel practice, opting for his players to rest. If one of his superstars is having a down game, Steve has been known to pull stories from his championship past that are relatable to that situation to pick up his players spirit. As I've sat back and observed Steve over the years, I get what he's doing. He has already figured out the strategy and the concepts. Now, he just needs to make sure that his players are always in the best position to execute those strategies and concepts. And Steve takes that responsibility and burden upon himself. Whether the issue is related to his players mind, body or spirit, Steve understands that it is his job to help that player through whatever they are going through to get them back to optimal shape to compete and fulfill his game plan. It helps that he genuinely cares about his players as people first, and it's clear that his guys know that. In my opinion, that is why they so willingly follow him. I'm inspired by Steve's system and philosophy because it just feels like the right way to go about leading a team. Connect with your players and their families on a personal level. Truly care about what is going on in their lives because personal issues will always affect anybody's work. Understand your players strengths and weaknesses and put them in a position to most effectively help the overall strategy. Do not follow boilerplate processes or strategy simply because; everything should be done with a purpose. Challenge the norm and do what works best for your team given the situation. Communicate openly and work through conflict; it is healthy. The only other coaching job Steve had before GSW was for his sons youth team. He used the exact same approach and philosophy to coach the Warriors as he did with his son’s team. Amazed at how Jeff managed to pull off such an amazing feat? You can too!

She began her career as an artist, crayon-sketching the wonders of the naturally beautiful scenes around her. In the process, she discovered her passion, her gift for expressing emotions through art. Completely self-taught, Wendy's instructor has always been her own curiosity. Today, her art lives in the homes of celebrities, billionaires, and discerning collectors throughout the world. In addition to her reputation as a celebrated artist, Wendy has also received notoriety as an international fashion and print model for the acclaimed Ford Agency in New York. You may have seen her on the covers of magazines, as well as in television commercials and on the product packaging for some of your favorite household brands. Wendy's latest and proudest pursuit is as an entrepreneur – she is the owner of The Art of Pecan , the world's leading producer of pecan oil. The Art of Pecan began when Wendy moved to Texas some years ago and instantly fell in love with the beautiful native pecan trees growing across her property. \"I merely admired them at first, not knowing anything about the extraordinarily healthy food they produced.\" After conversations with a family cardiologist and more research on her own, she realized that pecans are among the healthiest natural foods in the world, yet everyone just putting them on pies. She also learned that pecans are about 70% comprised of oil. If pecans are a superfood, she concluded, then pecan oil is their lifeblood. So she bought a press and went to work. Today, she produces award-winning pecan oil pressed from native Texas pecans. The Art of Pecan now operates out of the world's first pecan oil mill, located in Dripping Springs, Texas, and produces pecan oil for culinary, cosmetic, and other specialty health and wellness industries. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Wendy: My biggest challenge has been patience. When you start a business, it's very exciting, and you want everything to be instant. You see a vision, but this vision needs to be created in stages and is reliant on so many other components that you have no control over. I've learned that great things take time and if you are willing to wait, it will be worth it in the end. Q: How you would describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? Wendy: Our company culture is very free. We like to explore new ideas - we are innovators, creators. We're not afraid to go outside the box. We listen to signals and pivot when we need to. Our superpower is our quality and aesthetic. We pay attention to very, very small details. Few notice those details, but the ones who do are worth making the extra effort for. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Build a power team that can keep up with your company culture. When the time comes to eventually expand your team, consider the use of text-to-apply posters where customers can scan a QR code or text a number to gain access to all open positions. Job board integrations will also show all applicants within a single dashboard while saving you time in copying and pasting to multiple job boards. Post to over 25,000 job boards with a single click! Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Wendy: It's challenging to find people with the right work ethics. The younger ones are concerned with titles, and having more responsibility than they're ready for (so they can have a better title). They believe they deserve, instead of understanding that they have to earn that responsibility. Their passions are also misaligned; it's nice to pursue a greater good, but there's a bottom line to the business. Good intentions, virtue signaling, and platitudes won’t get the job done. It's also nice to find someone who anticipates, rather than merely reacts. You can be a very good reactionary employee; most are, in fact. But the really great ones anticipate. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: An easy way to screen candidates would be through video resumes and video interviews . By requiring applicants to submit a short introductory video, watch how candidates portray themselves. This could provide more insights into their work ethics, which may not be easily recognizable in their soft-copy resumes. Additionally, video interviews allow you to find out more about the candidates, without having to meet them physically, especially considering the current Covid-19 situation. Thereafter, you may arrange for a physical interview if necessary, only after narrowing down the applicant pool. Q: Who inspires you and why? Wendy: My parents are my biggest inspiration. My father, an orphan with no parents for guidance as a child, is an amazing father, and made a great family and career for himself. Him being an entrepreneur gave me the inspiration that I could also follow that path, and that anything is possible with some hard work. My mother comes from a family of 11 and was very poor, yet never gave up or complained about what she didn't have, and instead appreciated what she did have. They're both fighters, always by each other's side— even suffering from cancer together at the same time and getting through it together. That made me realize how lucky I am to have them, and the support and strength that they have instilled in me, to never give up no matter how hard it seems. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Wendy: I am not an authoritarian by any means, I'm very soft-spoken non-confrontational. I believe in the people I hire and that those people have my and my company's best interest at heart. I want people to enjoy their work environment and feel good about what they are doing. Mutual respect goes a long way. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Have a good idea of what qualities you’re looking for in a candidate? Utilize smart screening for multiple-choice questions and automated scoring, so that hiring managers can save time filtering through candidates. Include customized workflows and stages to each job post, allowing hiring managers to view applications via both their mobile app and email, review and recommend candidates, and add interview and training notes. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Wendy: I've worked several. The most memorable was working for the small fishing village of Saint George in New Brunswick, where I grew up. I rode my bike there and back seven miles each day to do a variety of humbling and honest duties: watering plants, road signing, picking up garbage, cleaning outhouses. It's the kind of work that helps you understand what hard work is, who the hard workers are, and the meaning of sacrifice. Starting out on a new business venture too?

Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” At Workstream , we have the rare honor of working with an incredible group of investors and advisors including Gokul Rajaram, who serves on the executive team at DoorDash, where he leads the premium ordering service Caviar. Gokul is also a board member of Pinterest, Trade Desk, and Course Hero. He previously served on Square's executive team. Prior to Square, he was a product leader at Facebook and at Google. In this Q&A, Gokul shares how he builds teams and brings ideas to life. Lydia (L):  You have an amazing track record as the “ Godfather of AdSense \" at Facebook - I'm curious, how do you bring ideas to life? Gokul (G):  I enjoy taking nascent concepts and working with teams to make them a reality, to productize and launch them. A compelling vision and North Star make it easy to motivate a team to bring that vision to life. L:  What does your typical day look like? G:  I try hard to reserve a couple of hours every morning to do deep thinking and work on longer term projects. Outside of that, my work day is filled with 1:1s, product and business reviews, interviews, and meetings. L: What is your process for getting product feedback? G:  You can never go wrong asking real life customers for product feedback, whether it means showing them (ideally clickable) wireframes when the product is not yet built, to actually having them use the product once it’s built. Do ensure you have them go through the entire product flow (including sign-up / on boarding). And just LISTEN to them, don’t try to rebut or offer arguments or reasons why a thing is the way it is. L: Do you have any advice for startups that are building for restaurant owners and operators? G:  Every restaurant is different, so you need a deep understanding of what segment you’re serving with your product. A single location sole proprietor restaurant has very different needs from that of a 10 location regional chain, which in turn is different from a national franchised brand. L: Are there any trends that excite you? G: The secular shift towards delivery and takeout excites me because it is something that allows for really interesting re-imaginings of what a restaurant experience can be. L: Shifting topics a bit, I'd love to delve into your experience growing and leading teams. This is always top of mind for Workstream, both as a startup and a hiring platform. What's your typical interview process? G: For each role, you need a clear articulation of the mission of the role, the outcomes that the role is responsible for, and the skills needed to succeed in that role. Once you have this, you set up interview tracks, one for each skill. The interviewer for each skill should be someone who has experience evaluating candidates on that skill. Example skills for Product Managers include strategic thinking, design intuition, technical chops and analytical competence. L: What do you, personally, look for in an applicant? G:  It depends on the role, but outside of the skills for the role, I look for energy/passion, humility and bias to action. L: What are common mistakes people make in the hiring process? G:  The #1 hiring mistake is focusing too much on the prior titles, companies and experience of the person (and being “blinded” by them), and not asking the tough questions around whether this person can actually do the job in the context of this company. The same role could be - and likely is - very different across two companies. L:  Now, I'm sure a lot of people are curious... DoorDash acquired Caviar from Square only a few months ago. Can we expect any big changes? G: Not much. Caviar is still focused on serving our consumers, merchants and couriers. As part of DoorDash, we get even more resources to do this! And that’s exciting. L: Has your team or structure changed at all since the move to DoorDash? G:  I’ve been lucky to work with a team that has been together for several years. I believe in Tours of Duty as defined by Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha in their book “The Alliance”, and so most people on the team have gone through several Tours of the Duty over the last few years. I believe it helps build new skills and keeps folks energized and excited for new challenges. L:  I love that book. I'm curious--d o you have any books you recommend to product teams? G: Never Split the Difference is the best book on negotiation I’ve ever read. It’s not just for product teams, but product teams, sales teams, and every other team / person can use it. Heck, I’ve used it not just at work but in my personal life too. Life is a series of negotiations! L:  So true. This is a bit off topic, but I'd be interested to know what tools / services you use to improve productivity. G:  I try to keep my brain uncluttered, so it’s important to have an easy way to transfer ideas or thoughts to paper or phone. Therefore, my two biggest productivity tools are a Field Notes book in my pocket + Apple Notes on my phone. L:  Now, I have to ask this next question for our readers / Workstream users... How do you think restaurants will look in 10 years? What will be the biggest changes? G:  I think the restaurant experience for consumers will change dramatically as off-premise dining (delivery + pickup) grows. I don’t know exactly how the experience will change, but I think the consumer experience of visiting a restaurant will evolve. We’ve already seen things like ticketing and self-serve kiosks emerge in the past couple of years. I’m excited to see what’s next! L: Is there any data about the restaurant industry that shocked you? G:  I read a stat saying that 60% of new restaurants fail each year, and this number grows to 80% if you take a 5 year view. This goes to show that it’s a tough industry; restaurant owners need all the help, tools and products they can find to help them grow their business, lower their costs and retain their staff. L:  I've read that too. It's a challenge that inspires us everyday. Now this last question is something I always like to end on... Is there a quote or mantra that inspires you? G:  I love this quote by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. “If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” It uses such a powerful metaphor to articulate why leaders should always start with “Why”. Without the “Why”, everything else (the “What”, the “How”, etc) is meaningless. L:  As a competitive sailor and team leader, I absolutely love that quote. Thank you so much for taking time out of your incredibly busy schedule for this Q&A. It was a great honor to include you in our Influencer Series!

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/30/19 Identifying Hiring Trends with Behzad Jamshidi Share this article Born and raised in Vancouver, B.C., Behzad Jamshidi's most recent endeavor was with Chef Gabriel Kreuther , the owner of a two-Michelin-star restaurant in New York City. He has been mentored in the kitchens of Michelin-starred and world-renowned chefs, such as Pino Posteraro (Cioppino's Mediterranean Grill, Canada's Top 20 Best – Vancouver), Daniel Boulud (Daniel, 2 Michelin stars – NYC), Massimo Bottura (Osteria Francescana, Best Restaurant in the World 2018 – Modena), and Eric Ripert (Le Bernardin, 3 Michelin Stars – NYC). Chef Behzad's training with these culinary royalty inspired his obsession for fine dining and service. He loves using skills that he's acquired, and applying them towards creating narratives through food. They evolve into stories that are whimsical and communal, which inspires guests to share their experiences with one another. Through Moosh , Behzad hopes to create platforms and communities for people who aspire to promote communal experience, create social changes, and celebrate the diversity within food culture. Q: What professional accomplishments are you most proud you since you start the Moosh NYC project? Behzad: Alongside our project partners, we have also been recognized by multiple trade publications and press such as the NYT, Eater, CBS and more. We have gained interest for the impact we make, in the way that immigrants share their stories and identities through food, and how essential they are to the American narrative and our culture as a country. We are putting together a dinner at the James Beard House March 11th, which will highlight and showcase the community and stories which inspire Moosh NYC , and share with the world a greater understanding about the density in Persian culture and cuisine. Q: What are the superpowers of your team? Behzad: Our ability to lead with authenticity, by sharing stories of our personal journeys, to creating communities through communal curated events, and raising awareness and impact around all our project - we are always cooking with the intention of giving guests more than just a meal, and more than just an experience. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Behzad: I make it a point to create and cater environments for my patrons and collaborators, that best promotes their defining qualities, and provide them with the freedom to explore, express and self discover wherever possible. I never want someone to walk away feeling like a project was a waste of a time, or that their contribution wasn't fully realized. I'm passionate about helping people define their own brand, and promoting it alongside my own. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Behzad: A career in itself is the biggest challenge. Having to balance all your day to day activities while keeping in mind the intentional support you need to provide yourself is indelible. I have the cumulative interests of over 50 people on any given day to keep in mind, while still managing my own stress, health and happiness and assuring that I'm giving the best of myself all the time. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Did you know that with integrated calendars , you will be able to save so much more time in your hiring process, giving yourself more time to balance your other day to day activities. Qualified candidates gain access to pre-set timeslots on your calendar, allowing them to book an interview slot of their convenience. This saves much back-and-forth in calls and emails! Furthermore, it also effectively reduces ghosting, since candidates are sent SMS reminders closer to the interview date, alongside an option to reschedule if necessary. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Behzad: I think we are still making the mistake of hiring based off a single dimension of need. We make a checklist of items that we feel are essential to a role, and require individuals who fill the role, and may produce underwhelming work that is not driven by passion. However, this checklist may also scare away individuals who could otherwise come to the table offering so much more if the role promoted their interests and sought out to learn what they would want to contribute. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Through video resumes , you will be able to find out so much more about a candidate beyond what they have on paper. This also allows you to figure out how they can contribute meaningfully to the team, before scheduling an interview (be it virtual or face-to-face). The video introductions can also be a platform for candidates to share about what they can bring to the table, which is a great opportunity for you to learn about how they would like to contribute to your team! Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Behzad: I've had many hourly jobs, and I've been fortunate that I have always loved what I did, in any capacity. I've worked in food and hospitality, yet no matter how laborious some the work was, I have always been my happiest. But in certain hourly positions, I couldn't help but count down the hours on the clock, to where I could leave a restaurant, and go explore and cook more of the food I wanted to.

First known for its unusual square beef patties made from fresh ingredients, the quick-service restaurant (QSR) has expanded its menu offerings with a breakfast menu earlier this year, which has successfully boosted sales in the US. The brand is also known for its innovative solutions - starting with their very own pick-up window from as early as the 1970s. Thus, it comes as no surprise that Wendy’s has jumped onto the bandwagon to make its services more digitized in today’s age of technological advancements. From the usage of social media strategies to implementing self-order kiosks in their outlets, Wendy’s is able to stay as one of the top 10 restaurants in the QSR space by staying relevant to their customers. Read on as we delve further into the fast-food chain’s success and how it is able to thrive despite the coronavirus pandemic. Embracing Social Media In this day and age, social media is ubiquitous, giving businesses a unique opportunity to connect with their customers digitally and a platform to put their brand out there. Ever came across Wendy’s’ Twitter account or their tongue-in-cheek tweets? Whether it is directed towards their followers or competitors , the team behind it is constantly ‘roasting’ people to build their social media presence. And for good reason - this gives a sassy voice to their iconic red-haired girl icon which definitely garners a lot of attention because of its unconventional way of speech. According to Kurt Kane, chief concept and marketing officer at Wendy’s, this is their way of cultivating authentic and real connections with their followers so that they are able to know more about the brand. In addition to that, Wendy’s is rocking the Twitter scene with its high organic engagement by replying to 20,000 tweets in an average of 15 minutes . In fact, a reply to a Twitter user asking Wendy’s “how many retweets (he should get) for a year of free chicken nuggets” captured so much attention that eventually the user’s tweet received 3.3 million retweets - the highest number of retweets at that point in time! Thanks to that, Wendy’s account also gained a whopping 970,000 new Twitter followers. With a strategy that brings out outstanding statistics, it is no wonder the fast-food chain was awarded Fast Company’s Most Innovative company in the social media category in 2019. Wendy’s recognizes the importance of using social media in modern day marketing and it has allowed the brand to reach new heights as they continuously receive awareness through their social media antics . And as more people show interest in them, only one thing’s for sure - they are certainly doing it right. Digitalization As more individuals are spending their time online, it is important to go to where the demand is - and that is exactly what Wendy’s is doing. Brandon Rhoten, vice president for digital and social media for Wendy’s, said that the company recognized how the digital space can play a huge part in bringing in customers into their restaurants . That is why in 2019, Wendy’s decided to set aside a budget of $25 million for the company’s digital transformation, broken down into two parts - $15 million for a partnership with consulting company Accenture and the remaining $10 million on digital scanners in the US chains. This move seeks to improve their consumer insights while giving the brand a chance to leverage its digital initiatives in the long run. Though this investment decision was made just last year, this does not mean that Wendy’s store operations were primitive before. The fast-food chain has implemented various digital initiatives such as mobile ordering and self-service kiosks in their stores, among others, to keep up with the latest QSR trends. They even utilized Google Preferred and TrueView to achieve the optimal audience and timing for their advertisements on YouTube as they knew that breaking through the audiences of the new media requires a different set of requirements than that of traditional media. Additionally, Wendy’s built a tech innovation center in 2015 solely for the purpose of building the ‘Wendy’s of the future’ - the 90 Degrees Lab . The lab focuses on improving the brand’s website, apps and self-order kiosks to ensure that their customers’ needs are consistently met with evolving technology. All in the name of improving their customer experience. By focusing their efforts on digitization and consistently innovating, Wendy’s is able to stay relevant and fulfill their consumers’ changing needs. It is worthy to note that while a digital transformation is imperative, Wendy’s also acknowledges the importance of staying true to its roots . That is by focusing on their quality of food, offering great value and service to customers while constantly improving their restaurants - the same mission founder Dave Thomas had when he opened his first Wendy’s outlet. Adapting in a COVID-19 World The pandemic crisis that hit the world earlier this year brought about much panic and precariousness in the country, leading to changes in consumers’ habits, tastes and preferences. For one, commuting to the office is minimized to reduce the risk of human contact. Naturally, this results in less drive-thru breakfast , or even purchase of the morning meal in general, affecting the likes of major fast-food restaurants such as McDonald’s and Taco Bell. However, Wendy’s is the only one to buck the trend. Despite launching their breakfast items right before lockdowns began, 7% of their sales belonged to their breakfast menu which added about 6.5% to its US same-store sales growth of 6.6% in its third quarter. This is a major feat for the fast-food chain which has never excelled in the breakfast space. The unexpected success of the launch could be attributed to Wendy’s decision to revise their breakfast strategy by reducing marketing and manpower needed during the morning shift. Wendy’s way of adapting to the new COVID-19 world plays a huge role in them being able to stay afloat, and even thrive, despite the despondent circumstances of the pandemic. Needless to say, in order to succeed even in the worst of times, it is important for a company to easily adjust its strategies when an unforeseen event strikes. The recipe for Wendy’s success in the QSR industry is a cumulative effort of the brand’s adaptive strategies, as seen from their digitization efforts and changes in breakfast menu operations during the pandemic. If you are a QSR franchise owner yourself, consider emulating their ways and you might just find yourself catching up to the big players in the market.

Even better news is that a second company, Moderna, could have a very similar vaccine announced soon as well. We like the sound of doubling the chances that businesses can reopen in a big way! Of course, many QSRs haven't had to wait for good vaccination news to be on a tear lately. In the last week, we've been seeing restaurant chains go on hiring sprees and announcing vacancies across the nation. Just a few quick hits: Domino's is hiring in 14 locations. Taco Bell is hosting \"hiring parties\" at 400 locations. 500 McDonald's in Michigan are hiring. 120 Dunkin' Restaurants are hiring in Ohio. And we're seeing hiring spikes in grocery stores as well; all great news for a job market that has seen another drop in unemployment to 6.9% . But Will The Overall Industry Pull Through? Of course, not all restaurants are QSRs and winter is coming. While chains are seeing big business after the economic downturn due to the pandemic , dine-in restaurants are having to contend with two pieces of bad news at the same time. One we saw coming: the colder weather. Even as restaurants get creative to remain open outdoors during winter months for a short-term , there are new questions about how safe these outdoor setups really are with a virus as contagious as COVID-19. The second piece of bad news: cases are suddenly at an all-time high . So even though there is promising news of a vaccine to come early next year, new restrictions and shut-downs may be coming before then that might hurt an industry already hanging by a thread. Due to this, dine-in restaurants will have to go for cost-saving efforts. We Just Need A Little More Time... And Help Fortunately, experts say that there is still time to avert a \"third wave\" in cases in hard-hit places such as Los Angeles. Couple that with the new administration's coming stricter mask mandate, and the potential for more stimulus support from Congress, the restaurant industry has a good chance of staying afloat until businesses can truly reopen again. And additional support seems to be coming from local government and businesses, even as national stimulus talks continue. Grubhub is giving $10,000 grants to help restaurants over winter through the Restaurant Strong Fund . The city of Cleveland is giving out grants to restaurants as well. So is Baltimore . It's been amazing to see restaurants see support in this way. And with the light at the end of the tunnel now seemingly in sight, it just might be enough to do the job. Is It Actually Bad News? A recent survey of HR executives conducted by the Conference Board revealed some information about how companies will or won't hire to close out the year in light of COVID-19. While the survey had some interesting data, what was more interesting is how USA Today decided to report its findings . The article led with that headline and the fact that \"nearly one in 10 U.S. businesses plan to lay off existing employees during the final three months of the year as a result of the outbreak.\" Nearly one in ten is 9%, by the way, according to the actual survey. But what did they bury toward the very bottom of the article? \" Twelve percent of businesses surveyed by the Conference Board plan to increase hiring in the final three months of the year.\" [emphasis ours] Last we checked, 12 is bigger than 9. The USA Today article tries to bury the lede here that overall, more companies are opening new positions than laying off workers . This would explain why jobs continue to recover even after downsizing , with the unemployment rate climbing to 6.9% just recently. The point here is that hiring isn't down across the board. Overall, the numbers are getting much better even after businesses’ cost-cutting efforts. The Actual Problem is K-Shaped Poor journalism aside, the survey and article do highlight the very strange job recovery we are seeing. Tech companies , e-commerce, housing, and consumer products have seen a boom over the past few months, and these are the companies that are doing most of the hiring. Amazon , CVS, Apple, Google, Meta , LinkedIn , and Microsoft have all been on hiring sprees due to the tech industry ’s market conditions . Meanwhile, traditional dine-in restaurants, hospitality, travel, and other industries that rely on customer service are the ones continuing to see layoffs due to their economic conditions . We are seeing a great divide in the hiring process between these industry buckets , so while overall retention is currently happening, only one bucket is benefitting. And while the hiring bucket seems to be larger than the non-hiring bucket at this stage, that doesn't help the businesses on the short end of the stick. Hiring to Close Out The Year We here at Workstream know that a lot of hiring still happens in the last couple months of the year (that companies stop hiring in November and December is somewhat of a myth ), which means that for the companies who are restructuring and staffing , competition might be fierce and talent or job seekers can get snatched up quickly. So if your company is in the fortunate position to open positions or increase the current employees , it's important to start the recruitment process right now with a good strategy in place to streamline the process. We also expect the K-shaped recovery to get better as hard-hit industries get somewhat of a boost during the holiday season. Even now, many hospitality businesses are hiring back furloughed employees or new employees . And with the news of a 90% effective vaccine hitting this week as well, there seems to be a light at the end of this dark tunnel. Need help hiring the right people? Workstream can help.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/30/19 Overcoming the Challenges of a Restaurant Business Share this article Christopher is a serial restaurateur and owner of Crazy Harry's Bar, which has been featured by Forbes, and has been ranked by craftbeer.com as the number one craft beer bar for the last 2 years. As a child, Christopher aspired to be a lawyer, but he eventually found his true calling in the F&B industry, cooking and serving people. From preparing food, ringing in orders and even cleaning tables, Christopher truly enjoyed the entire process. He even started a taco blog called Order of the Taco, which focused on food and travel (as he goes around eating tacos!). Fast forward to today, Christopher has opened numerous restaurant chains, not just in the U.S., but also all over the world. He also runs a small consulting firm targeting restaurants and bars. In the near future, he intends to expand his business by opening a small diner-style restaurant. Q: You have a rich experience in the Food and Beverage industry, what was the most challenging project that you handled? Chris: The most challenging project would have been opening a restaurant in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We were there during Ramadan, and there was a tremendous amount of tension between the franchisee and franchiser. Working with the multiple languages, cultures and being respectful to all of their traditions that we were not completely familiar with opened the door for a number of unforeseen challenges. Q: What are the superpowers of your team? Chris: Consistency. The Hallmark of a great bar and or restaurant is consistency. We want to make sure the customers know what to expect. We want people to be interested in what we are up to, and be a part of it with us. Nothing great is really that great unless you get to share it. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Chris: Ever evolving, I hope! I'm a very direct person, I think it is important to manage the details while still leaving a lot of creative freedom in all projects. I will often ensure that things are done, as it drives me insane to see how long it'll take before someone takes the initiative. I want to invest in people that want to invest in themselves. The more folks put in, the more I'll repay them with happiness. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Stay on top of things and still manage the details through the streamlined feed in Workstream's dashboard and mobile application, regardless of where you are. From new applicants to referrals and even existing employees, check on the status of their hiring stages, onboarding or training documents with ease. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Chris: The growing trends of social media and things out of my comfort zone. I still carry note cards and a pen everywhere. I like taking my notes like this, and transferring the written notes to another medium, be it a computer, or email, or something. It is a challenge to let go of silly stubbornness and learning about some of the newer systems. It is a constant fight of data vs gut and so much is turning into data, yet I still like to use the gut for most of it. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Ease into technology with Workstream's paperless onboarding system . Fuss-free and user-friendly template and document storage ensure that all of your documents are stored electronically. Trigger alerts will also be sent if the paperwork is incomplete. Preserve important HR documents and never lose them again! Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Chris: Work ethics . More like the serious lack of it. It amazes me that many companies I consult for are facing the same struggles. Folks feel like they are working their tail off, but in reality are not at all. More money goes into paying the wages, as we are taking such a big hike at once. This is causing product prices to increase, so we want better folks to help justify the hike even more. But finding great folks that will show up, that will work, that do want to grow, is becoming harder and harder. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Identify key candidates that suit your hiring criteria with smart screening . Through questions (set by yourself) on topics such as availability, proximity to business and credentials, candidates are automatically scored through Workstream's system to determine if they are interested and qualified. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Chris: My last hourly job was in 2000. I was waiting tables and a prep cook. I hated it. I didn't mine staying later some days and leaving earlier others for the same pay. I want to not feel rushed or strapped to those time frames. I don't really like breaks, and if I do, I don't want 10 minutes or this other malarkey where I can't do anything or it's against the employer. I think it is nuts but that is just for me personally. Q: Who inspires you and why? Have you ever had an hourly job? Chris: Everyone and thing inspires me. I work hard on my own emotional intelligence and take time to reflect and meditate everyday. I now feel inspired by every situation - the good, bad, positive, negative, happy, sad times. My goal is to give every person I encounter moments of making their life better, to inspire them.

Make no mistake, he has plenty of experience and leadership under his belt and makes it known. Both his parents immigrated from Ecuador in search of a better life full of opportunities for their children. Born and raised in Miami, Steven knew all about the people, culture, and history of his town. He was very active in high school - becoming the captain of both the Swim Team and Water Polo Team. He also found time to take on various leadership positions in clubs such as the service organization Key Club, President of the Chinese Club, and Co-Captain of the legal Mock Trial Team. Juggling all of this, he still managed to graduate with Summa Cum Laude, at the top of his class. Before going to university, he joined the Marine Corps Reserves in 2013 and joined 4 th ANGLICO, the Marine Corps Reserve unit located in West Palm Beach, Florida. In university, he became President of the Public-Speaking Club, Toastmasters. He has also held customer service positions both in The Walt Disney World Company and Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. These prepared him to become a young business owner, and with all this experience, Steven launched The Dragon Chinese & Sushi Restaurant in Hialeah, Florida with three others. As the Chief Business Development Officer, Steven guided his business and hit major sales goals in just the first three months of operations. The business is on track to break even within the first six months, something that is rare in start-up businesses. Steven says, \"While we continue to work hard to make sure we are successful, plans are already being developed for the opening of our second restaurant. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Steve: The greatest challenge I have experienced in my career is, unfortunately, letting employees go. I'm a very sympathetic person who enjoys getting to know my employees as I believe that encourages a good working relationship and allows for human connection. The hardest times I have faced are when I have to separate business from my personal feelings and do what's best for the company. It's a difficult situation for me because I get to know my employees and what they have done in their life until that point. This becomes problematic when they are not producing the work results desired or have erred in other ways. As I'm sure other hiring managers feel the same, I wish all our hires could be rock stars or we could part on mutual terms. This is now always the case. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Want to increase the retention rate of your employees? Using data-driven analytics , identify the best sources for applicants, and determine what percentage are qualified. By analyzing the retention rates by applicant source, easily identify opportunities to reduce spending, and promote more on platforms that provide long-term hires. Q: How you would describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? Steve: Our company culture is very easy-going! The ages of those in our company range from 22-26. Compared to other companies, this is rather youthful and leads to a very relaxing company culture. We believe that as long as the job is getting done properly, our employees should get to have fun too. This in turn allows employees to correlate a feeling of \"satisfaction\" when it comes to work rather than a feeling of \"dread.\" The superpowers of our team are a consolidation of different work experiences. Our CEO is a Certified Public Accountant who has held many internships and jobs in the accounting and executive world. Our COO and CHRO are part owners of another small restaurant and bring in the experience of start-ups, the food industry, and various hiring strategies. I, myself, have held countless leadership positions as well as being well-versed in the service industry having worked for giants such as The Walt Disney World Company and Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Consider implementing video resumes , where applicants can upload a short video introducing themselves, allowing you to identify those with easy-going personalities (or other traits that may be a good fit for your team. Additionally, use multiple choice questions to automate scoring, such that only qualified applicants move on to the next stage. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Steve: Some of the challenges we see in hiring are less of an applicant pool due to the better economy. While this is great news, it does result in a smaller hiring pool and does not allow much wiggle room for hiring managers. On top of this, our restaurant is located in Hialeah, and unfortunately, is not where our target employees live. As we are a Chinese/Sushi restaurant, the employees we seek are usually located in the more tourist-trafficked areas such as Miami Beach. On top of this, the minimum wage is expected to continue increasing through 2023 which cuts in the margin of small businesses. Raising menu prices may seem to be a simple solution, but it isn't as feasible as it sounds, nor is it fair to the average consumer. Particularly so, for the lower-income area that our restaurant is located in. This challenge is something our team we’re looking to work on in the foreseeable future. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Increase your applicant pool with text-to-apply posters that allow visitors to scan a QR code (or text a number) to retrieve all open positions. Job board integrations will also allow you to post to over 25,000 job boards with one click, increasing the visibility and awareness for your job postings. Smart sponsorship also utilizes artificial intelligence to optimize job postings, putting you in front of 10x as many job seekers. Q: Who inspires you and why? Steve: The beauty of life inspires me. Life can be short, it can be long. It can be not so good, but can also be magnificent. That is the beauty of life and it inspires me to value every single moment of it. So I strive to become the best person I can be, both in my professional and personal life. I work hard every single moment I can to ensure I leave something beautiful behind in this world. As cliche as it may sound, it's what made me who I am today. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Steve: My leadership style is very situational. I believe that training for employees needs to be top-notch in order to produce someone who can be independent and reach conclusions on their own. Once that independent employee is molded, I am very hands-off and encourage them to take charge. This leads to a more empowered human being who is able to gain experience in order to become not only a great employee but a great manager in the future. However, this ideal employee is not always molded so easily. Thus, I believe in a more hands-on approach for those employees who are not quite there. The intention is to create a guided experience throughout their time with us until they become comfortable enough to become an independent employee. I also believe in being fair but firm. Everyone makes mistakes regardless of their role because we are human beings. However, once corrected I expect my employees, colleagues, and myself not to commit the same error again. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Steve: I've had a few hourly jobs, both in hospitality giants - Walt Disney World and in Four Seasons. I was able to take on Front Desk and Concierge roles in both companies that are well-known for customer service. One is about creating magic and the other about creating memories. I learned a great deal about the hospitality industry from both these companies. That is what they are all about, the guest. One of my managers once told me: \"They might forget exactly what you said. They might forget exactly what you did. But they will NEVER forget how you made them feel.\" This has shaped my vision for what I want my company to be and what I strive to provide. The best service imaginable.

When seating is at a premium, what can locations do to earn more revenue? Well for some, the answer lies in enacting time-limits for guests. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal highlighted the lengths some restaurants are going to ensure they can serve multiple parties throughout the course of a shift. This includes some locations limiting meals to 90 minutes to 2 hours, or bringing out dishes together instead of one at time. Of course, the worry is that hurrying paying customers can leave a bad taste in their mouths, and enforcing it adds just another uncomfortable task for servers who already need to enforce social distancing and mask usage. But many owners see no other recourse than to make the most use of the few outdoor tables they might have available to their businesses. Delivery in 30 Minutes or Way Less Another way the industry is speeding up is in delivery. While in the past, speedy delivery was mostly relegated to pizza and Chinese food, now that everyone is home and ordering more varied options for delivery, restaurants are trying to catch up to the standards set by chains like Domino's. An article in Restaurant Dive cited ghost kitchens (delivery and takeout only locations) as a method that restaurants are utilizing to make food faster. After all, if the delivery portion is taken care of by services like Uber Eats or Postmates, all the ghost kitchens need to focus on is the food itself, which is precisely what they are designed to do at a lower overhead. With the public's appetite for delivery not going anywhere, it'll be more and more important to make meals quickly. If your location is the only one taking 45 minutes to an hour, while your competitors are turning around delivery orders in 20 minutes, eventually the consumer will trickle over to the faster options. Speedy Hiring Of course the area we directly see businesses speeding up is in hiring. We wrote last week about the fierce hiring competition that is happening already for seasonal workers. When delivery drivers are at a premium, the restaurants that can hire fast have the edge on having enough employees for the busy winter and holiday season. Time-to-hire for delivery workers is shortening as demand is increasing. Basically, businesses don't want to lose out on good applicants by taking too long in their vetting and getting out offers. In QSRs, the average time-to-hire has been around 10 to 14 days, but now hiring turnaround time is getting closer to 7 days. For an industry with sky-high turnover rates, being able to refill roles rapidly can often be the secret to success. New innovations in automated hiring and AI can make short work of the stacks of resumes that come in through your system, giving you an edge over your competition. In Other News... Job Fairs from the Comfort of Your Couch As the job market slowly recovers, companies that are looking to hire are finding new and novel ways to put themselves in front of the right candidates... while maintaining social distancing of course. One tactic that we're seeing more and more by SMBs are virtual job fairs like this one for veterans that recently took place in Chicago . Virtual job fairs are great for businesses that can't quite afford to run a large virtual event on their own, or can't attract many applicants with their brand alone. By joining with other companies, the sum is greater than its parts and these events can cater to thousands of job seekers at the same time. The key is to have as many of your hiring reps available as possible to virtually interview the job seekers as they sign up for a slot. The more you can meet with during the event, the better your odds of finding great future employees. SMBs looking to shore up their numbers should join industry-specific or regional-specific virtual job fairs as they are announced. Would You Like Fries with Your Job? McDonald's and other Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) are taking a unique approach to socially distanced job interviews by having \"Drive-Up Hiring Days\" at some of their locations. Job seekers can just drive up and perform an interview with a hiring manager on the spot. No word on whether they can order a combo too though. It's a creative idea to not only stay safe and process many interviews at once, but a smart marketing ploy to get attention to the event. We think during this unprecedented time of the pandemic, companies can and should be less \"professional\" in their hiring and adopt interesting strategies like this to attract new talent, especially in a competitive industry like QSRs. SMBs can have their own drive-thru interviews, or hold interviews outside on a patio, or anything else that can take advantage of a unique time to try some unique things. After all, if the hiring experiment works, they can continue on long past the end of the pandemic. Make Virtual Hiring An Event Amazon is the king of creating new holidays, like Prime Day. Now they might be establishing a new one: an Amazon Career Day . Basically it's their own virtual job fair, but they're making it a real event with fireside chats, career coaching, and even celebrity guests. We can see more enterprise-level businesses heading in this virtual event day direction with their hiring push. After all, it's cheaper to have applicants virtually come to them, than to put efforts into recruiting. Of course, not many companies have the ability to hold Amazon-level events, but creating a virtual event is a whole lot less expensive than the real deal. More companies might dedicate a day like this to advertise the event and bring applicants to them. Of course, processing hundreds or thousands of resumes is a tall order for any business and a giant time-sink. That's where's we come in.

It can be used to speed up the onboarding process for new hires, make confusing company policies easy to understand and serve as a reference manual for common tasks. Of course, it can only do any of those things if it’s written and formatted in a way that makes sense to employees. And that’s not always an easy task—especially if you’ve never written one before! That’s why we’re going to show you: How to effectively structure and write an employee handbook What makes a good restaurant employee handbook Why, even if you already have an employee handbook, you probably need to update it in 2024 But, before we get into those topics, let’s take a moment to make sure we all understand what a restaurant employee handbook is and its importance to your business. What is a restaurant employee handbook? A restaurant employee handbook is a document that contains all of the major rules, policies and guidelines for your employees. It can also include information on things like your restaurant’s mission and values. We know that it can be hard to imagine how to structure and include all of that information in one place. So, let’s now look at what you should include in your handbook. What should be in a restaurant employee handbook? A good restaurant employee handbook includes the following sections. Introduction Introduce your employees to your handbook by writing a welcome note and brief history of your restaurant. Mission and core values Next, you’ll give employees an overview of your restaurant’s mission and core business values. This information helps ensure your employees know how to do things, like: Embody and contribute to your restaurant’s brand while at work Feel a sense of purpose and community Communicate what makes your restaurant different from competitors when talking to customers Code of conduct Sometimes, your employees will need a place to reference what is and isn’t acceptable behavior. So, in this section, make your expectations clear. Outline standards for conduct on things like: Dress code Schedule changes Cell phone usage Conflicts with coworkers and customers Customer service Anti-harassment Procedures for making complaints Be friendly in your tone to not seem patronizing. But, in this section, you may also choose to include information about the consequences for ignoring or breaking the code of conduct. Compensation and benefits This section will likely be the one your employees refer to the most. So, it’s important it accurately reflects your restaurant’s policies as well as federal, state and local laws. To do that, you’ll include information on: Pay structure for part-time and full-time staff Tips declaration and structure Overtime compensation Sick, medical and family leave Vacation leave Health and insurance plans Any additional employee benefits (e.g. education assistance programs) Scheduling processes and guidelines In this section, outline how employees can view and request changes to their schedule. Be sure to also state clearly how much notice is needed for changes to be processed. In addition to those things, you may also include information on: How to use your restaurant’s scheduling tools Who to contact for last-minute emergency schedule changes Consequences for tardiness or unapproved absences Which holidays your restaurant will be open or closed Standard restaurant operations and procedures You may already have a section on your restaurant operations and procedures in your restaurant operations manual. But you can also include it in your employee handbook for easy reference. What type of things should you include? How-to information for all of your restaurant’s important systems (e.g. your Point of Sales software), routine tasks (e.g. opening and closing guidelines) and who on your team to reach out to for any situations not covered in the handbook. Conclusion You can conclude your employee handbook by stating how the rules and guidelines of the previous sections support the restaurant's mission and values. You can also include a note to recognize and thank your employees for being part of your team. What makes a good employee handbook? Simply including the information we just outlined isn’t enough to make a good handbook your employees will actually use and refer back to. We recommend making sure your employee handbook also has the following characteristics. Clearly communicated core values and company culture You and your employees may not fully be aware of it, but the long-term success of your restaurant depends on your company culture . So, make sure your handbook clearly communicates your restaurant’s core values, long-term goals , your ideal customers, why you serve those customers and how you hope those customers describe your restaurant. Straightforward explanation of policies Don’t make your employees guess or assume anything when reading about the company policies. This isn’t a legal document. So, aim for clarity. Explain your policies in layman terms, avoiding unnecessary corporate jargon. Engaging design, format and language Your employee handbook is part of your brand. And how you design, format and write the content should reflect that. Here are some examples of things you can do: Use the same typography and colors that you use in your other marketing materials Share old and recent photos of your restaurant when discussing the history of the restaurant Tell stories to demonstrate key points and explain complex policies whenever possible Flexible policies No matter how good it is, your employee handbook can’t cover every possible situation. And you may have to review some issues on a case-by-case basis. A good employee manual makes that clear by demonstrating that certain policies can be modified if the circumstances call for it. Why your employee handbook may need to be updated in 2024 Since the start of the pandemic, the way you run your restaurant has likely changed a lot. And, unfortunately, it doesn’t look like things are going to fully return to pre-pandemic conditions any time soon. So, make sure your employee handbook reflects how you and your employees work now. This is especially true if you’ve done things like: Adopted new digital tools and technologies Started or expanded your restaurant’s delivery and takeaway options Introduced flexible work schedules for employees Implemented new policies to follow federal health regulations Including this information in your handbook is especially important if you're also in the process of hiring new employees and rehiring former ones. Why? Because you don’t want them referring to outdated information. Final thoughts Your restaurant employee handbook can become the go-to reference source for new and existing employees. But, first, you have to write one that covers all of the necessary information. Use this outline to write or update your employee handbook this year!

Most people don’t like receiving negative feedback. The problem is, the longer you wait without saying anything, the more productivity suffers. The lack of prompt feedback will normalize the performance issue. This is why communication with employees is vital. If you need to have that difficult conversation with an employee, make sure to have it early - early intervention is always the best course of action. Here are some tips on how you can deal with employee performance management issues, particularly for hourly employees . Give Regular Feedback Giving both positive and negative feedback to employees is important for efficient performance management. Positive feedback is valuable as it shows you value your employee. At the same time, it helps to ensure that they maintain their good performance. Meanwhile, negative feedback gives the employee an early opportunity to fix their mistake. Bear in mind, however, the difference between constructive and unconstructive feedback. When giving constructive feedback, you point out where the employee is going wrong. Then you offer a solution to their problem. Unconstructive feedback, on the other hand, is just criticism. It demoralizes the employee as they have no chance to fix their mistake. Doing this can be detrimental not only to the employee but to the whole team. Additionally, it is important for employees to communicate their feelings on the feedback they receive. Do they think it’s fair? After all, there may be a good reason behind an employee’s poor performance (more on this later). Allowing them to defend themselves helps to prevent feelings of resentment as well. Not to mention, it will also help you understand the situation from the employee's perspective. Create a Performance Improvement Plan If an employee is performing poorly, you may want to create a performance improvement plan . A performance improvement plan is a formal document that outlines an employee’s performance issues. It also sets goals that the employee has to achieve to improve their work performance. Here are steps you should follow when writing the plan: Establish an objective. (For example, to decrease the time spent completing a customer's payment transaction.) Establish a time frame for achieving the objective. Establish criteria or metrics for achieving the objective. (For example, the employee must complete the transaction within 1 minute.) Decide how often the manager and employee need to discuss progress. If the employee’s performance isn’t monitored, the issue can return as he/she may assume that their performance is acceptable. It is useful to refer back to the performance improvement plan from time to time. This helps you determine whether there’s an improvement in the employee’s performance. Have The Talk At The Earliest As with most things, you need to deal with performance issues as soon as possible. Although it can be difficult, it is always the best course of action in the long run. It gives the employee a chance to quickly fix their mistake before it becomes a habit. It also shows the employees that the manager is closely managing their team. Besides, if you deal with the issue at the earliest possible time, you can quickly address the root of the problem. If an employee’s poor performance is, for instance, due to personal issues, you can suggest the employee swap shifts with another for the meantime. Just make sure that the employee understands where they are going wrong and the steps they need to take to improve. Such adversity can always be turned into an advantage. Source: Linkedin What if the employee shows no interest in improving their performance? In that case, it might be time to dismiss them. Do note that this action shouldn’t be taken lightly as unfair dismissals can lead to lawsuits. But if there are no better options, proper preparation for the worst-case scenario is crucial. And this is where the documentation comes in. Ensure You Document Everything It is important to have adequate documentation of your employee’s performance. Aside from that, you may also want to track all of the conversations between you and your employee. In other words, emails and text chains should also form a part of your documentation. Why do you need these? Well, if the employee reacts badly to dismissal because they feel that it is unjustified, these documents can be used as evidence that the company arrived at a fair decision. It wouldn’t just be your word against the employee's. In short, the documentation helps to protect you against lawsuits. If the situation goes smoothly, the employee will feel less hard done by when they see proof of how they performed and how the management’s decision was based on that. Acknowledge Their Improvement On the other hand, if an employee improves, their improvement should be acknowledged. If you do this, you can expect further improvement because of higher morale, and thus, better employee retention . Failing to do so can lead to their performance taking a downturn again. Source: Europepmc There are many ways you can acknowledge your employee’s performance improvement. For one, you can thank them in front of the entire company or send them a gift. You can even take them to lunch! It doesn’t matter how you do it - the point is, you want employees who go the extra mile to feel that you appreciate their efforts. In Summary Proper employee performance management is key to a company’s success. At the end of the day, you need to ensure that all employees are performing as they should. When teams meet their goals, the business, by extension, meets its goals too. In this article, we discussed some of the ways you can achieve this. Always maintain a feedback loop with employees. Employees need to know both the positive and negative aspects of their performance. Make sure you don’t avoid that difficult conversation when you identify any form of poor performance. Quickly implement a performance improvement plan to ensure an employee knows how to get back on track. Documenting an employee’s performance is very important too. It helps you track their progress at work and protects you from possible lawsuits. Consider following these tips to improve your team's productivity and efficiency. This way, your company may be well on its way to success.

Vitaligent currently owns and operates 92 Jamba franchises and two Cinnabon bakeries. Jeff also serves on the board of Jamba franchise advisory council and on the board of directors of Second Harvest of the Greater Valley. Prior to serving as CEO, Jeff was the president and CEO of Vitaligent and head of operations with Jamba, supporting more than 800 domestic and international locations. His leadership spans roles in operations, category management and specialty sales. But none of this came naturally to Jeff when he first started in food service three decades ago: in fact, he calls himself a humanities man who didn’t have a footing in the business world at all. “I’ve learned the business from being in the business and taking it one day at a time,” he says. In so doing, Jeff slipped up a whole lot—but he was granted the chance to learn from his mistakes and go all the way from dishwasher and cook to CEO. He offers us some of the best practices he’s learned and developed in that process, noting that these apply particularly to organizations that focus on the potential of their team members to grow the company. Best Practice #1: Create a fail-safe growth environment The idea of “failing forward” prevails in tech and other innovation-driven industries, where failure is an essential part of growth and experimentation. The attitude is not something people typically associate with QSRs, where consistency reigns. Yet Jeff sees it differently—that a willingness to fail is essential in the restaurant business. “If you’re coming into an organization, and you're learning how to do something for the first time, whether it's cooking or running a store or running a district, you're going to have to learn a lot of that stuff on the job,” he says. “The environment has got to be a safe one for you to make mistakes. If people come in and they are just scared of making a mistake, they're not going to learn. They're not going to take risks. They're not going to be open to change. And I think we all know how important being willing to make changes, to try some things, is for success.” He applies this belief not only to hourly workers, but to managers and other leaders—the majority of whom started off as frontline team members. So how can you create an environment where employees can fail safely—where they can improve both the business and themselves by growing and learning? Two ways: Give them both room to fail and a safety net of engagement. “You don't just throw them out there, right? You want to give people really good training and preparation, and then let them know that you're there with them,” Jeff says. “That takes a very high level of engagement. You're giving somebody room to work their plan today or this week. Then you're going to be following up with them tomorrow or next week to debrief on it.” Show them safety—don’t just say it. If a team member’s plan didn’t work out so well, you don’t berate them, or restrict them, or negate them in response. Instead, work with them to point out what went well, and what adjustments you both need to make. “I’m going to show you that the mistakes you may have made yesterday are part of the learning process,” Jeff says. “You’re not going to be punished. You’re going to have the opportunity to translate them into a new plan. And once we’re having successes, we’re going to celebrate them together.” Best Practice #2: Role-model through storytelling Another way to further develop an environment for safe risk-taking and growth is to go beyond working with team members’ mistakes—to talking through your own. “One of the best ways to teach people and to role model in our business is through storytelling,” Jeff says. “So I am very open with people about the mistakes that I've made and what the consequences are.” For instance, he candidly discusses an experience from when he first stepped into becoming a franchisee. He had never selected a new store site before—“And I can tell you that some of those stores haven’t worked out exactly as I expected them to,” he says. “I think we’ve all selected people for our teams, and it turned out those people were not the right fit. I’ll be the first person to tell people about those experiences and what I learned from them.” A sense of humor helps too, he’s noticed. Being able to laugh about past mistakes and lessons learned goes a long way toward telling the story of your own growth. “Being vulnerable yourself is a really good way of role-modeling that,” Jeff says. “Then people will feel more comfortable knowing that they can fail sometimes too.” Best Practice #3: Insist on transparency Jeff acknowledges that this best practice may not be a cultural fit in every organization, but it’s one he has learned to push to expansive edges: “We have this mindset where we insist on transparency,” he says. In practice, the way he thinks about that is “not having meetings after the meeting.” Everything is welcome on the table the first time, and managers especially can feel capable of speaking up if Jeff has succeeded in creating and modeling that fail-safe environment. “I think about it a little bit like siblings,” Jeff says. “I probably argue more with my brother and sister than I do with most people, and we have the most candid conversations. But I’m always going to be first to have their back and defend them. And I think that's a really important team dynamic.” This way, everybody’s voice gets heard by the entire leadership team. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the organization does what everyone wants—but the team knows it has heard all the ideas and can move forward together. “At the end of that process, whether you like the decision or not, everyone can rally together and treat that decision like it’s their own,” Jeff says. “We’re all on the same page. That dynamic is important for an organization that relies on teamwork.” Best Practice #4: Choose confidence over comfort The difficulty with full transparency, of course, is that those conversations can be really uncomfortable. Speaking up can feel incredibly vulnerable, no matter what someone’s level in the organization is, and the ideas themselves might be challenging. Yet the team isn’t there to make each other comfortable. “We’re not trying to make them un comfortable,” Jeff says, “but we would rather that people be confident than comfortable.” He has found this priority to add real value to Vitaligent and its franchises. The comfort zone (which is entirely distinct from a safe environment) doesn’t encourage growth, or innovation, or risk-taking. It doesn’t push the company to create new value. Jeff connects this back to the first best practice about being willing to fail: if you feel confident, you’ll be more capable of putting yourself out there. “We think that having confidence in your own voice, confidence in your role, is going to drive leadership success,” Jeff says. “Part of what we’re doing is trying to help people develop, not just so that they can be successful in their roles with us, but that they can be more successful in their lives. It really begins with teaching frontline team members how to make themselves vulnerable, how to put themselves out there. They learn that when they do that, things tend to actually work out better for them than not.” Best Practice #5: Prioritize people—on both sides of the counter This final best practice springboards from that attitude of developing your workers: “We’re asking people to be genuine with our guests, right?” Jeff says. “We’ve got to be genuine with our people too.” He acknowledges right up front that Vitaligent is not a transactional business, unlike other restaurant businesses that prioritize speed of transaction. That’s not a judgment call—just a different business model. But they have come to understand that the guests at their Jamba and Cinnabon franchises care more about feeling acknowledged, recognized and tended to than they care about getting their food fast. His teams arrived at this understanding by thinking about the business through the lens of what’s best for the guest. “Now, look: when you’re really trying to focus on positive outcomes for people, usually those interests overlap with your interest as a company,” Jeff says. Why not expand this same philosophy to include the team members working at the company? For him, that means shifting his emphasis from what can team members do for the business to what can the business do for team members . Providing them with extra training and coaching will help them move their careers forward. Adjusting the benefits you’re able to offer so that they can access the ones most important to them will improve their wellbeing outside of work. The end results might require more up-front investment, but they ultimately improve the company. This is true even when—and Jeff stresses it—what’s best for the team member is to grow beyond your organization. “You not only have to accept, but you also have to celebrate positive results that might not be in your best interest as an organization,” Jeff acknowledges. “It may be that you’ve prepared somebody for a level of leadership that's now enabling them to go do something outside your organization, and you need to celebrate that. And you need to show everybody in the organization that you’re celebrating that.” He's gone through this himself recently. A general manager with Vitaligent since the very beginning just moved into another, more specialized industry, with increased pay and more opportunities for his family. Jeff admits to being heartbroken at losing this valuable team member—but it’s even more gratifying that the experience with Vitaligent gave the employee the confidence to pursue this career path. “That’s one of the rewards of the business,” Jeff says. And he points to some good karma—even beyond the truth that this reputation will entice the best candidates to join the team: “Somewhere down the road, there's a pretty good chance that we'll be working with these people again in the future.” Final thought: Are you prepared? Jeff offers five best practices for improving and growing a QSR organization at any scale by focusing on the interpersonal environment: Make it safe to fail by demonstrating that mistakes and failures are opportunities to adjust your plans, rather than a cause for retribution. Model your own failures as a leader by telling stories about your mistakes and how you learned from them—and maintaining a sense of humor about it all. Develop transparency by expecting and allowing all ideas to be spoken aloud—and then deciding as a team which ones to pursue. Foster confidence more than comfort, because confidence will spur innovation and growth outside the comfort zone. Put people first. Of course a business has to turn a profit to sustain itself. But prioritizing the development of your team members just as much as the customer experience will always improve the business too—even when their successes mean a loss for the company. But really, Jeff closes with one key piece of wisdom that summarizes them all—and it applies both to experienced restauranteurs assessing their practices, and budding entrepreneurs looking to get into the industry. “This business is so dependent on people and the relationships you have with people,” he says. “The real best practice is to ask yourself, do you really care about people? And are you really prepared to invest in people?” Jeff believes both of those things need to be true to succeed in people-centric business. “If you get energy from investing in people,” he says, “then this is a great space for you.” TAGS Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

If you take it at face value ( as the stock market did ), then the report is a hugely positive indicator that America’s economic situation is already on the road to recovery. While unemployment numbers have never been this high since the Great Depression, due to the COVID19 pandemic, it actually declined in May as employers added 2.5 million jobs. No one expected this. So are we back? Here’s another wrinkle as we delve deeper: the Bureau of Labor Statistics may have made an error in the jobs report that artificially deflated the unemployment numbers. Almost immediately, the BLS issued a statement saying they had misclassified furloughed workers as being “absent from work due to other reasons.” Correcting for this error means the 13.3% unemployment rate in May is probably closer to 16.3% . And since April’s rate was 14.7%, that means all this optimism was for naught, right? Well… Yet another piece of information to consider: this error was made in March and April, too . Factoring in the correction, April would be around 21.2%. Meaning, since April and May should both have their respective unemployment rate adjusted higher, the decline in May is still reason for some optimism . After all, no data set is perfect; but directional data , as in whether the unemployment rate is going up or down, is still valuable data to have. In fact, the BLS should probably be applauded for immediately putting out a statement that adds correction and clarification to their jobs report. How many organizations would admit to doing math wrong the very next day? “BLS and our partners at the Census Bureau take the misclassification error very seriously, and we’re taking additional steps to address the problem.” - BLS Good on them. So back to the point: is there a jobs recovery in process? The numbers seem to suggest that the US may have peaked in terms of unemployment. Major cities are opening back up, and while the positive COVID cases are still on the rise , people are getting back to work one way or another. As long as hospitals aren’t being overwhelmed (which was the entire point of “flattening the curve”), jobs will be coming back. So what does hiring look like right now? Spring 2020 U.S. Hiring Data and Trends As you might expect with the high unemployment rate, even though jobs may be coming back, there is a giant pool of workers who are all competing for those jobs. We at Workstream put together proprietary data that should shed some light on what the current climate of job openings is like in our U.S. Hiring Trends for Spring 2020 Infographic : One of the most eye-opening statistics we found was that in many of the southern states, getting an hourly job is actually harder than getting into Harvard, which had an acceptance rate of about 5.2% in 2018. That’s 1 in 20 applicants. But comparatively, current competition for jobs is so stiff, with dozens or even hundreds of applicants for each position, it’s literally harder than getting into arguably the most prestigious Ivy League school. But there are positive trends as well. Mitigating some of job losses are businesses such as grocery stores, delivery services, and assisted living facilities that are hiring as fast as they can; many seeing 100 - 400% increases in hiring .

This adage has become a daily reality for a huge number of businesses. But the issue isn’t necessarily a lack of skilled candidates or people seeking work. Restaurateurs need to offer more than a competitive salary or amazing food to attract and retain hourly employees. They must stand for something . As a business, that purpose can take the form of sustainability or eco-friendliness. Sustainable business practices and eco-friendly food packaging can bring organizations a meaningful mission and a sense of identity. And increasingly, being a sustainable business can also be profitable. Sustainability resonates with customers. The 2022 Edelman Trust Barometer , a credibility survey consisting of online interviews with 36,000+ respondents, reveals that 60% of us choose where we work based primarily on our beliefs and values. But how do sustainable practices translate to the ways you conduct business? What sustainability means in the hospitality industry Sustainability for restaurants isn't just about recycling or water conservation. It involves innovative ideas about how we source foods, consider supply chains, and more. Some sustainability business practices for restaurateurs to consider using are: Landfill diversion and recycling . In the U.S. alone, the production of food that ends up lost or wasted generates a volume of greenhouse gas equivalent to the emission of 32.6 million cars . Diverting food waste to businesses that create compost or animal feed helps with sustainability. Supporting sustainable sourcing . This practice includes buying foods locally to simplify the supply chain and reduce your carbon footprint, along with choosing vendors who offer eco-friendly products and services made from recycled (or remanufactured) materials. Implement zero-waste cooking techniques . Add items to your menu that use every part of the ingredients you buy. For example, this could mean flavoring broth or soups from the bones you would otherwise throw away. Using more of what you already have means buying less. Incorporating new sustainable business practices in your workplace can feel overwhelming at first. Even if you think you're already running your business in an eco-friendly, sustainable way, look to your peers for fresh perspectives on sustainability and be open to adopting new practices in the industry. As more businesses participate, the barrier to entry is lowered for everyone . Wondering where to start or which sustainability practices to try first? Ask questions and get involved in your community. Learn which businesses or vendors support your sustainability practices. Be aware of your environmental impact. Not just in food waste but how much water or electricity you consume. The role of sustainability in sourcing new employees One research study about sustainability as a business strategy showed that not only do 66% of people pay extra for products and services from socially responsible companies, but 67% of them prefer working for those companies. Many people want a job that brings meaning to their lives. Employers should respond to this, or expect to lose employees to businesses that do. Being known as a restaurant with a purpose—defined by its sustainable business practices and eco-friendly worldview—can be an effective strategy for attracting like-minded people (even customers) to join your workforce. Sharing your company’s purpose with current and potential employees helps to explain why they should get involved with your business, how they can also make a difference, what ideals they share with you, and where they belong. In contrast, any employees not drawn to your purpose of sustainability might opt out. Those who remain are more likely to also align with the company's purpose and appreciate that they’re part of something bigger. Ways to promote your business’ purpose to others Adhering to your sustainability business practices in the kitchen or the front of house only gives your company’s mission so much exposure. For everyone to see how your organization differentiates itself by its sense of purpose, look to: Your social media channels , corporate website, and marketing efforts. First impressions really do matter. Always put your best foot forward by presenting your ethos in every channel. Let sustainability be an integral part of your identity and how you position yourself as a brand. Your core employees. By learning more about your current staff, you’ll begin to create a profile of your ideal employee. Give your people a voice. See why your people have stayed with you, why your mission resonates with them, and if they can suggest people to recruit. Your weekly meetings or one-on-ones. It’s vital to stay engaged with the people who believe in what you do as a business. See what they need to fulfill your purpose. Listen for the reasons why they continue to work for you and encourage them to refer employees. How to focus on sustainability as you run your business Promoting awareness of your organization’s purpose and implementing your sustainability practices can be time-consuming. Give yourself more time in the kitchen with your crew or in front of house with customers by using technology for the other key aspects of your business like hiring, onboarding, and training.

For employers who want to create a better work environment for their employees, here’s a complete employee benefit guide to answer your questions and point you in the right direction. What are employee benefits? Employee benefits are any sort of compensation (whether tangible or intangible) given to employees in addition to their standard wages or salaries. These benefits range from simple perks like free snacks to paid leave, childcare, healthcare, or even bonuses. Anything an employer provides their employees outside of regular pay counts as an employee work benefit. Why benefits for hourly workers matter It’s true; implementing and managing benefits for employees takes time and energy for your HR team—which means it takes money away from your business. But it’s worth it to ensure your hourly workers are happy, healthy, and can sufficiently provide for themselves and their families. When your employees feel like the company cares about their well-being, they’re more likely to stick around for the long term. Employee benefits are one of the best employee retention strategies that you can implement for your business. According to online surveys, 49% of employees will start looking for new jobs in the next year because their current work benefits are insufficient or difficult to understand. Considering the average cost of replacing an employee is between one-half to two times the employee’s annual salary, which can be upwards of $60,000 per incident, providing sufficient employee benefits can actually save your company time and money—not to mention the headache of going through the hiring process time and time again. And speaking of hiring processes, providing sufficient employee benefits can also help you accelerate hiring and find quality candidates. Seeing enticing benefits in a job listing encourages more quality applicants to apply for your positions. Potential applicants are even more likely to apply to a job that pays less than what they want if the benefits meet or exceed their needs. Yes, providing employee benefits will add to your HR workload, but they will also help decrease it in other areas. Your HR team will be able to enjoy faster and smoother hiring processes, along with lower turnover rates. In the end, work benefits save your company time and money. Plus, they help you retain experienced hourly workers, boosting your overall productivity for years to come. 4 types of employee benefits Since benefits include anything beyond standard pay, there's really no limit to the number of employee benefits you can offer. However, most employee benefits packages fall into these four categories: Health and wellness Retirement plans Additional compensation Work/life balance benefits The ideal employee benefits package will contain elements of each of the four types of employee benefits; however, you're welcome to mix-and-match as your company sees fit. Health and wellness Health and wellness benefits are the most common type of employee benefit offered by employers. These are benefits that support an hourly worker's well-being and often show up in the form of insurance. The most common types of insurance benefits are: Health insurance (including medical, dental, and vision) Life insurance Disability insurance Prescription drug coverage Employee assistance Mental health benefits In many cases, employers will match a portion of their hourly worker's insurance costs or provide a base level of coverage that employees can build upon from there. There are some employers that cover the entire cost of insurance for their employees. It all depends on what your company wants to do and can afford. Providing health and wellness benefits shows that your business cares about your hourly workers. Since most health insurance options cover the family as well, it also shows you care about your employees' families as well. Historically, standard health insurance like medical was enough to make employees happy, but times could be changing. According to online polls, 83% of Gen Z employees believe mental health benefits should be a priority in the workplace. This is something that wasn't even on HR professionals' radars even a few years ago, but it's becoming increasingly important for employers to offer more comprehensive health benefits if they want to make their hourly workers happy. Retirement plans One of the best employee benefits are retirement plans. Nobody wants to work forever, and hourly workers want to know that all their hard work will pay off (quite literally) when they’re ready to retire. Retirement benefits show that a business isn’t just invested in their hourly workers for what they can provide right now. Instead, it shows they’re interested in their employees’ entire lives and wants them to feel secure in their future. The most common type of retirement benefit is a 401(k) contribution. With every paycheck, both the hourly workers and the employer contribute to the employee’s 401(k) retirement account. The hourly worker chooses how they want to invest their contributions and how much they want to contribute, and the employer matches a percentage of the employee’s contributions. Employers may also choose to implement a defined retirement plan that’s completely funded by the company, otherwise known as a pension plan. When an employee retires, they receive a set monthly benefit based on their tenure at the company and retirement age. Additional compensation Who couldn’t use a little extra cash every now and then? Additional compensation bonuses are simply monetary bonuses given to hourly workers in addition to their regular pay. These are some of the most common additional compensation bonuses provided by employers: Sales commissions Performance awards (whether individual, department, or company-wide) Lump sum gifts (for outstanding actions, holidays, etc.) Although we all love a little bonus every now and then, there are some arguments against compensation bonuses. The biggest issue with monetary benefits is that it could spur unethical behavior and hinder teamwork. Before implementing additional compensation work benefits, it’s a good idea to clearly outline the bonus policy and give everyone the same opportunity for bonuses. The more transparent, the better. A little competition is good, but unhealthy competition can hurt your work environment. Work/life balance benefits Work/life balance has been a touchy subject for employers and employees for decades. It’s a fine line between optimizing productivity and giving your hourly workers enough time outside of work to do the things they love. Work/life balance benefits are perks designed to help your hourly workers spend more time doing what they enjoy outside of work. The most common work/life balance benefit is paid time off (PTO). Almost 80% of private industry employees have access to paid vacation leave. Although U.S. employers aren’t required to offer paid vacation leave, it can be a great way to give your business a competitive advantage when it comes to hiring and retention. If a potential applicant sees that your company offers PTO and a competitor doesn’t, there’s a good chance they’ll choose to work for you, even if the pay isn’t quite equal. Plus, if you give your hourly workers enough paid time off throughout the year, they won’t get burned out, increasing happiness rates. And happy hourly workers increase your business’s retention rates and boost overall productivity. Other types of work/life employee benefits include parental leave, bereavement, training days, and sabbaticals. Legally mandated work benefits While there are dozens and dozens of employee benefits employers can choose to offer, there are a few benefits employers are required to provide by law. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS): “Legally required benefits provide workers and their families with retirement income and medical care, mitigate economic hardships resulting from loss of work and disability, and cover liabilities resulting from workplace injuries and illnesses.” Under BLS laws, there are four legally mandated work benefits: Social Security and Medicare Workers' compensation insurance Unemployment insurance Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) protections Any applicable employer with full-time hourly workers is required to provide at least these four work benefits. Social Security and Medicare Social Security and Medicare are both considered legally required employee benefits. As such, it’s mandatory for employers to withhold a 6.2% Social Security tax from employee’s gross compensation up to the Social Security wage base. These funds are added to the Social Security program, which the hourly worker can draw upon when they reach retirement age. It acts as a mandatory federal retirement plan. Similarly, employers must also withhold a 1.45% Medicare tax, with additional withholding rules depending on employee’s income. Medicare is a federal healthcare program that people are eligible for once they reach retirement age. Workers’ compensation insurance If a worker can no longer perform their duties after an injury on the job, workers’ compensation covers the medical bills and a portion of their wages until they’re physically fit enough to go back to work. Employers are required to maintain some level of workers’ compensation insurance to protect their hourly workers from the financial burden of potential on-the-job injuries. Unemployment insurance Unemployment insurance assists hourly workers who lose their jobs. Hourly workers may file for unemployment to get financial assistance and temporary benefits during transition periods after being fired or laid off if they meet specific criteria. Employers are required to contribute to unemployment insurance when processing payroll taxes to protect their hourly workers if they ever become unemployed. Each state has different requirements for employer contributions, so make sure you understand the minimum coverage regulations in your area. Most state requirements for unemployment insurance benefits can be met either through self insurance or state-run programs: Self-insurance: The employer agrees to pay for medical bills and income directly in the event of a workplace injury or illness. If you choose this option, you must prove your business has the financial resources necessary to cover potential payouts. State-run programs: Employers can purchase a workers’ compensation insurance policy from the state. The employer pays a monthly fee based on the number of employees, and the insurance pays out in the event of a workplace injury or illness. Basic healthcare protections Because healthcare is such a major cost in the U.S., employers are required to provide a minimum level of healthcare coverage to employees. Applicable large employers (ALEs), which are typically companies with an average of 50 or more full-time employees (including equivalents), must offer adequate and affordable medical coverage for their employees. The specific policies and coverages are up to the employer, but the employee must not pay more than a specific percentage of their income for premiums. Employees should also have access to a reasonable network of healthcare providers, and the plan should cover at least 60% of the cost of medical services. These basic coverages are called the “minimum value standard.” Employers are also required to provide unpaid, job-protected leave for specific medical and family reasons under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). According to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), employers must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per 12-month period for family and medical reasons that qualify, like a chronic personal illness, birth of a child, or caring for immediate family member with a chronic or serious illness. Most common (and best) employee work benefits Although employers are welcome to offer any type of employee benefits they want (as long as they meet the federally required benefits), some benefits are more common than others in the workplace. Here are the top ten most common employee work benefits in the U.S.: Private healthcare plan (medical, dental, and vision) Retirement and/or pension plans Training and development benefits Stock options Flexible hours Life insurance Food and snacks Extended leave (including vacation and sick days) Monetary bonuses, awards, and gifts Company equipment (computer, phone, vehicle, etc.) If you’re wondering which employee benefits are the best, most employees value any and all benefits. There aren’t any specific benefits that are inherently better than others. But typically, the better the benefits you offer, the higher-quality candidates you attract and the lower your turnover rates. Average employer costs According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, employee benefits accounted for 31% of total employer compensation costs in 2022. In some cases, the cost of health benefits alone can reach up to $15,000 annually per hourly worker! While that might seem like a lot (and it is), these benefits are essential if you want to maintain a high-quality hourly workforce. Providing employee benefits does cost your company money, but there are creative ways to lower the cost without hindering your ability to remain competitive or maintain your workforce. For example, never underestimate the power of free lunches or snacks! All over the country, employers are getting creative with their benefits to remain competitive without hurting their bottom line. Here are just a few cost-effective benefits to make your hourly workers happy: Public transit cards or reimbursements for travel expenses, including tolls and gas Company-sponsored discounts for local restaurants, coffee places, gyms, childcare, etc. Free or designated parking spaces Cell phone plans Extra time off for volunteering or training Wellness resources like first-aid training The only limit to the benefits you can offer your hourly workers is your imagination! And remember, employee benefits don’t entirely count as a cost; they’re an investment. If you provide sufficient benefits to your hourly workers, it can increase morale, generate productivity, and boost retention rates—all of which will help your company save money in the long run. Employee benefits management best practices It’s not easy for your HR team to monitor and maintain all the various employee benefits offered by your company—especially if government regulations are involved. To reduce the possibility of errors and limit the strain on your HR team, follow these employee benefits management best practices: Hire a specialist: It's less likely for details to fall through the cracks if someone is dedicated to a task. If you don't already, it's important to hire a dedicated employee benefits specialist to help you find the best options for your company, monitor costs, implement new policies, ensure compliance, and even negotiate prices for some benefits. Stay on top of costs: The cost of employee benefits is rarely static. Make sure your HR team is on top of costs and whether the changing costs are worth the investment over time. Monitoring essential data will help you maintain a successful benefits strategy in the long term. Use the right software: Modern business is all about finding the right software to suit your needs. With a little technological help, you can simplify HR processes and keep a sharper eye on the minor details that come along with employee benefits Include benefit information in your employee handbook: Hourly workers need to know about the benefits if they're going to use and enjoy them. Make sure everyone on your team understands the benefits they have access to by clearly outlining all your benefits in the employee handbook. Talk to your employees: Needs (and wants) change over time. Regularly talk to your hourly workers to see what benefits they want. Your benefits package might change over time to suit your employees' or the worlds' changing desires. Employee benefits bring business benefits Providing benefits for hourly workers isn’t an unnecessary cost for your business; it’s an investment in your workforce. If you can provide your team with benefits beyond their standard paycheck, it gives them the feeling that the company actually cares about them and their lives, increasing retention rates, bringing in the best quality candidates, and boosting morale and productivity. It’s easy to see how providing basic benefits to your hourly workers can “benefit” your business. When you care for your team, your team will care about your business. Providing strong benefits is just one way to improve your employee experience, and employee retention as a result. A worker-first hiring and employee experience helps you attract loyal employees from the start and retain them longer.

With dine-in operations inevitably ceased, companies had to lay off many of their service staff and restructure their workforce to meet the changing needs of their customers. With the new year reigning in, however, the economy is looking more hopeful as the virus is slowly getting under control. As mentioned in “ The 2021 Great Rehiring ” post, more QSRs are looking to reopen their business and hoping to recruit the right talent for their company. In fact, for the restaurant industry itself, 286,000 workers were hired in February. Simultaneously, countless Americans are also looking for a job to make up for lost opportunities in the previous year. Needless to say, companies have to rehire their staff as quickly as possible to get back on their feet and unemployed individuals are not just waiting around either. But how do you ensure that you are hiring fast enough whilst at the same time, not compromising the safety of your new and existing employees? In this article, we will be going through some of the ways in which you can hire safely and the best practices you can adopt to ensure that you are doing your part in eradicating the virus that has kept the world on its toes for far too long. Establish Due Diligence First and foremost, it is important for you to stay updated with the latest government regulations pertaining to restaurant operations. We can never emphasize enough how critical it is for you to keep your employees and the public safe. The CDC Federal website provides some useful information which you may refer to. Do also take note that regulations may differ depending on the city or county you are in. In California, for example, it is compulsory for employers to conduct a COVID-19 testing program statewide if it is discovered that someone with the virus was found at the place of employment. Additionally, you may want to find out about the safety measures implemented around the world and find out what are the best practices you may adopt to protect your employees. For instance, in Zurich, the use of plastic visors is advised against as it creates a “false sense of security” without actually providing any form of protection unless paired with a face mask. Ultimately, it is always better to be safe than sorry. Thus, be sure to do your own research before officially resuming your QSR’s operations. Doing all the necessary due diligence to keep your employees safe should be the priority of your company. After all, by doing so, you are also gaining your employees’ trust as they are reassured that their company is doing the best they can to keep them safe. Moreover, public sentiments will also be favorable towards you when words get out that you are taking it upon yourself to keep the COVID-19 virus at bay. After ensuring that you are abiding by the relevant regulations, you can then focus on ways in which you can conduct your company’s end-to-end hiring operations safely. One thing’s for sure, the pandemic has opened doors to all kinds of digitizations for the HR department. Considering that it has dramatically improved efficiency, we think that most of these digitized hiring workflows might even stay post-COVID. Below are some tips we have gathered for you so that you can be sure to hire without compromising on your new and existing employees’ safety. Checklist for Safe Hiring 1. Reduce Time-to-hire Speed is essential when it comes to hiring hourly workers, especially because most of them simply want to secure a job fast. It also improves their candidate experience as they will be less anxious when companies get back to them not long after they have sent their applications. A way to reduce your time-to-hire is by automating a part or almost all of your hiring process. By allowing technology to do the work for you, you can get your hands on more quality candidates in a short period of time. Workstream offers various automated services which you can use to streamline your hiring process. Some of them include moving an applicant onto the next round automatically after he/she passes the background check or screening questions. As this requires little to no work from you, you are able to focus on what matters. 2. Contactless Hiring With safe distancing measures set in place, it has become difficult for people to meet physically, let alone attend an interview in the QSR headquarters. To ensure that your company does not flout regulations, consider adopting a contactless hiring strategy. Allow your candidates to send a video resume so that you are able to know them better even without physically meeting them and conduct interviews virtually through Zoom sessions. Additionally, as 90% of job seekers use their smartphones to look for a job, you might want to consider going mobile when hiring your prospective employees. At Workstream, we offer a text-to-apply feature that allows applicants to apply for a job conveniently through their phones. 3. Mobile Onboarding/Training As mentioned previously, setting up physical appointments with your candidates can be difficult due to the current circumstance. Consider shifting your onboarding and training resources to a mobile platform so that you can minimize contact with others and at the same time, ensure their safety. Workstream allows you to onboard your new hires by sending them a text message containing relevant documents for their onboarding. Additionally, handbooks and training videos are also sent via text before they start their first day of work. To ensure that your new hires complete their mobile training, reminders will be automatically generated and sent to your new (or current) employees. 4. Consider Other Recruiting Methods While recruiting through mobile means has been proven to be effective, you may also try out other recruiting methods to source out for candidates. Diversify your search so that you are able to hire only the top talent for your company. Some examples include participating in virtual job fairs or hiring events. Protecting Your Staff in the Workplace As important as it is to hire safely, measures to protect your staff after they are hired should also be strictly followed. Consider creating a checklist that has to be ticked off before (and possibly, after) your employee starts his/or her work properly. Some of the measures you may want to include are wearing face masks and hand gloves, preparing hand sanitizers for customers and staff, creating a routine for your employees to sanitize their hands after a certain period, daily temperature checks for everyone, and many more. Always remain mindful of the changing situation and implement your measures consistently so that your customers know what to expect too. If you are a franchise owner, be sure to work closely with the corporate branch, and vice versa, to keep up a consistent brand service and image. Remember to also comply with your local government’s regulations as these are often always evolving. As mentioned before, this will help improve the public’s confidence in you. Some individuals may still be wary of being out and about. Thus, implementing such measures will definitely help them patronize your QSR with a peace of mind. Additionally, your staff will gain a better employee experience since they know that they are protected and working under a responsible establishment. Moving into a Post-COVID World As we gradually move into a post-COVID world, it is important to make sure that you and your organization are not complacent when it comes to implementing safety measures. Keep up with the latest government directives and be sure to follow them. At the same time, consider following our tips above to ensure that you are hiring safely and protecting your customers, staff and brand image. COVID-19 has definitely accelerated the digitization of hiring processes and implementing the use of technology is imperative for you to stay ahead of the game. This will also likely improve candidate experience and interactions with the HR team will be viewed more favorably.

You might be familiar with the countless forms to fill out, policies to read, meetings to schedule. It's as though we've strapped ourselves into an endless ride of administrative tasks .

In this post, we'll walk through how automated workflows can streamline HR processes and make your company culture more inviting for newcomers. We will also discuss how implementing digital forms helps reduce human error and boosts employee productivity. By delving into automated workflows , you'll uncover a range of potentials. So, let's dive in and see what we can uncover together! Understanding Automated Onboarding Onboarding new team members is a crucial step in setting them up for success. But, traditional methods can be tedious and prone to human error . That's where automated onboarding steps into the spotlight. An automated onboarding process streamlines tasks like paperwork processing and data entry. No more manual work or lost documents. It ensures that every employee receives consistent training content, creating an even playing field from day one. Automated workflows , part of this system, are designed to cut down time spent on administrative tasks during hiring. This helps accelerate the process and minimizes the risk of errors by diminishing human error . The Role of Automation in Onboarding In any company culture, efficient processes play a key role in retaining employees and enhancing their productivity. The onboarding process is the first impression to most candidates meaning it needs to be smooth as to not turn away your potential best employees . A study showed that companies relying heavily on manual data entry had higher turnover rates because new hires felt disconnected from the organization. Employee onboarding automation can really help ease high turnover pressures throughout the onboarding program . To fix this issue, introducing an automation platform lets you give your new hires a warm welcome without being bogged down with mundane chores. It enables you to track your employees' progress through digital forms instead of stacks of paper files—sounds relieving already? Automating HR Processes for Better Onboarding The magic of automation can turn the traditional, manual process of onboarding into a seamless and engaging experience. Automating the onboarding process can help to make new employees feel part of the team right away, rather than just being a speedy or efficient process. According to HRIS data, companies that automate their onboarding processes often dodge costly fines and penalties because they're more likely to comply with legal requirements. Automation gives us this safety net by ensuring consistency in policy application across all hires. The Impact of HR Automation on Employee Engagement But there's even more value in automating your employee onboarding than compliance alone. The right blend of digital forms, automated workflows , and learning management systems lets you build an immersive journey that connects each new hire to the company culture straight away. This isn't conjecture - according to LMS reports, those who've undergone automated onboarding show higher engagement levels. Think back: we’ve all had our first days at work filled with mountains of paperwork—manual tasks so mundane they distract us from truly integrating into our roles. Now imagine if we could swap these out for interactive online sessions? Sounds like a dream come true. Choosing the Right Onboarding Software To begin, you must select software that suits your individual requirements. No single solution is ideal for everyone - it's essential to pick a program that matches your particular requirements. Your onboarding automation platforms selection can make or break your implementation process. Picking an adaptable system allows for seamless integration into existing workflows . You want to be in that sweet spot where automating employee onboarding isn't just another project but part of everyday operations. But remember.

Enhancing Employee Experience with Automated Onboarding A well-oiled automated onboarding process is more than just a time-saver. It's the first step to creating an exceptional employee experience , making new team members feel valued from day one. The Role of Personalization in Onboarding Nobody enjoys feeling like a replaceable part. That’s where personalized onboarding comes into play, letting you tailor experiences to each new hire . This makes them feel unique and acknowledged. Digital workplaces make this personal touch possible by enabling tailored learning paths based on individual roles or departments. By doing so, employees get relevant training content right off the bat. An interesting fact here: companies that nail their onboarding experience can improve employee retention rates by 82% . Moreover, such employees are likely to stick around for at least three years.

So there we have it – implementing automated processes isn’t merely a tech upgrade; it's an investment towards building your company culture and retaining top talent. Streamlining Administrative Tasks through Automation Think about the countless hours HR teams spend on administrative tasks . Studies show that a whopping 73% of their time is dedicated to this. But, what if there was a way to give some of that time back? Welcome to the world of automation. With tools like Paperwork Processing Software and digital forms, we can automate these mundane tasks. No more manual data entry or tedious paperwork processing. Instead, you get an automated workflow designed for efficiency. This means less room for human error and quicker turnaround times. Imagine having all your new hire 's onboarding documents processed in record time. Besides speeding up processes, automating administrative tasks also reduces costs associated with manual work. It lets HR professionals focus more on strategic activities like improving employee retention rates. This isn't just theoretical talk; companies have seen real results from implementing automation in their onboarding process . Automated workflows help new hires complete simple tasks faster, saving them valuable settling-in-time. Automation doesn't mean losing touch though. It can actually enhance interactions between hiring managers and team members by freeing up more face-to-face time previously spent buried under admin work. So let's make life easier by embracing technology today – it’s not only smart but efficient too. Ensuring Compliance with Automated Onboarding When we talk about automated onboarding , one aspect that takes center stage is compliance. With an automated workflow , it becomes easier to ensure consistency and adherence to company policies . Automation offers a straightforward approach to dealing with intricate activities. Manual onboarding processes often leave room for human error . But with an automated process , you can make sure every step aligns perfectly with your legal requirements and company standards. This doesn't just help your team members start off on the right foot - it's also crucial from a business perspective. A negative onboarding experience could lead to new employees looking elsewhere - upping this risk by 200% according to some studies. And let's not forget about potential fines or penalties due to non-compliance issues. Making Automation Work for You A robust automation platform lets you create standardized digital forms and training content tailored specifically towards each role within the organization. It makes tracking employees' progress simpler, reducing manual work involved in administrative tasks like scheduling meetings or data entry.

Share this article Ever tried finding a needle in a haystack? That's what the candidate evaluations process can feel like for hiring managers . An overwhelming pile of resumes, countless interviews and yet, that ideal candidate remains elusive. I remember my early days as an HR manager. I would stare at stacks of applications on my desk with dread. How was I to find the perfect fit amidst all this paper? The solution came in two words: Candidate Evaluations . This strategic method transformed how we identified talent and made decisions - but it wasn't always easy! Join me on this journey as we delve into why these evaluations are crucial, uncover various tools to enhance your evaluation process, explore strategies for fairness and transparency during assessments and so much more! Are you ready to transform your recruitment strategy? Stay tuned... Understanding the Importance of Candidate Evaluations Assessing applicants is a key piece of the recruitment procedure. It helps identify the ideal candidate from an extensive pool and influences critical hiring decisions . But why are candidate evaluations so important? Let's start with some numbers. On average, each job opening attracts about 250 applicants according to recent hiring statistics . With such vast numbers, it becomes essential for recruiters to use effective evaluation methods that can filter out unqualified candidates. The role of candidate evaluations in recruitment Candidate assessments play a pivotal role in identifying talent among job seekers . They allow you to assess whether an applicant meets all your job requirements and evaluate their potential for success within your company. An effective evaluation form is key here as it provides structured interviews and targeted questions designed around specific job descriptions which help uncover relevant skills or experience. Impact on hiring decisions A well-structured candidate assessment also significantly impacts final hiring choices made by recruiters or the wider team collaboration involved in selection processes. Hiring managers often base their decision not only on hard facts like qualifications but also factors like culture fit and soft skills. This requires careful consideration during interview sessions where evaluators observe how candidates perform under different situations; they might even ask them situational or behavioral interview questions that simulate real-life scenarios at work. In essence, transparent candidate evaluations give more insight into what lies beyond resumes - understanding if a person fits well within existing teams or if they align with company values become crucial points considered before making any final decision about hires. Simply put: A thorough evaluation process makes sure you don't miss out on hiring the right talent. Key Takeaway: Understanding and applying effective candidate evaluations is crucial in the hiring process . It helps you sift through numerous applicants, pinpointing the best fit based on job requirements, potential for success, culture fit , and soft skills. Remember: thorough assessments give insights beyond resumes and ensure you don't overlook top talent. Techniques and Tools for Effective Candidate Evaluations With the right tools and techniques, candidate evaluation can become much more manageable. It's like searching for a needle in an enormous pile of straw - but with modern techniques and resources, it can be more akin to finding Easter eggs. Leveraging Technology in Evaluations The rise of technology has made life easier for hiring managers . Think about assessment methods as your shiny new metal detector on this egg hunt. Specifically, recruiting software such as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are game-changers. An ATS automates mundane tasks and organizes all candidate information at one place – making evaluation less daunting than spotting Waldo on a crowded beach. Evaluation techniques have also evolved thanks to advancements like virtual interviews which help assess soft skills or specific abilities required for remote work situations. With such tech tools, you don’t just get applicants’ data; they provide valuable insights aiding final decision-making during evaluations. Incorporating Structured Interviews & Standardized Evaluation Forms Beyond technology though, structured interviews make sure each candidate gets asked similar questions ensuring fairness while standardized evaluation forms give consistency across assessments making comparisons between candidates easier than picking out differences between twins. So there you go: modern recruitment is not simply about gut feeling anymore—it involves utilizing smart technologies coupled with effective strategies designed around fairness and objectivity—all aiming towards improving the quality of hire because let’s face it—no one wants to keep searching forever. Ensuring Fairness and Transparency in Candidate Evaluations A fair, transparent candidate evaluation process is a cornerstone of an effective hiring strategy. It not only supports hiring managers but also fosters trust among job seekers . So how do we ensure this? Let's dig into it. Firstly, equal opportunity should be the heart of your recruitment process . This involves evaluating each applicant based on their skills and qualifications alone, rather than personal characteristics or unrelated factors. But remember: Fairness doesn't signify treating everyone identically, but rather providing everybody an equal opportunity to thrive. Fair Evaluation Methods In order to promote transparency during evaluations, focus on implementing structured interviews as these provide all candidates with a consistent experience specific to job requirements while reducing time spent interviewing by eliminating unnecessary questions. Use targeted questions that relate directly to key competencies needed for the role—this helps keep assessments objective and relevant. Communication skills are important when going through a structured interview because you want to be as smooth as possible for the potential candidates. The Role of Collaboration Team collaboration plays a vital part in maintaining fairness too. Multiple steps like involving various team members from different levels or departments outside of human resources can add diverse perspectives, making the final decision less biased. Hiring teams need clear guidelines about what constitutes acceptable feedback so there's no ambiguity, which could potentially lead bias seeping into reviews unintentionally. This method also promotes a better understanding of the candidate’s suitability , thus supporting hiring decisions significantly. Collaboration will result in finding the best candidate and help with the candidate’s ability to onboard if they end up getting the job due to being exposed to more of the team than just the human resources department. In-person interviews also help when it comes to collaboration. The more face time the better! The Role of Culture Fit in Candidate Evaluations When evaluating candidates, it's essential not to overlook the significance of cultural fit . Cultural fit is all about how well a candidate meshes with your organization's culture and values. This isn't just some HR buzzword; research shows that employees who align with their company’s culture tend to stick around longer and perform better. But, finding this perfect match can be as elusive as hunting for a four-leaf clover on St Patrick's day. Cultural fit involves assessing whether a job seeker will thrive within your work environment or clash like stripes and polka dots at a fashion show. It includes things like work habits, communication style, attitude towards teamwork, etc., which are often harder to evaluate than hard skills but equally important. To assess cultural fit during evaluations effectively: Ask targeted questions: Questions should delve into what motivates them at work, their preferred management style or even what they liked least about their previous jobs. Use structured interviews : This method helps ensure consistency across interviews so every candidate is evaluated fairly against the same criteria - reducing biases inherent in unstructured chats over coffee. Prioritize soft skills: While hard skills may get them through the door, soft skills help keep them there. Look for good communication abilities and emotional intelligence among other traits depending on your specific organizational needs. You might ask why put such emphasis on something seemingly subjective? Well because according to SHRM, hiring an employee who does not align with corporate culture can cost up to 60% of that person’s annual salary – now if that doesn’t make you sit up and take notice, we don’t know what will. Remember: The goal is not to hire clones who all think alike. It's about finding individuals whose values align with those of your company. So next time you're evaluating a candidate, remember culture fit isn't just another box to tick off – it could be the secret ingredient in your hiring success recipe. Key Takeaway: Don't just see culture fit as an HR buzzword. It's key to hiring success, affecting retention and performance. To nail it, ask targeted questions during evaluations, use structured interviews for fairness, and prioritize soft skills along with hard ones. Remember - finding candidates who align with your company values can save you significant costs in the long run. Creating Effective Evaluation Forms The evaluation form is your secret weapon when it comes to candidate evaluations . This tool, when utilized correctly, can facilitate the normalization of the appraisal process and guarantee impartial decision-making. Parsing resumes and initial screenings might give you a basic understanding of the applicant's qualifications but using well-structured evaluation forms lets you dig deeper into their skills, potential, fit for company culture, and more. What Makes an Evaluation Form Effective? An effective evaluation form goes beyond just checking off boxes against job requirements. It encompasses three main components: relevancy to role requirements, objective metrics that minimize bias in scoring candidates' responses or behaviors during interviews or assessments, and simplicity which means easy-to-understand criteria so all hiring team members evaluate candidates on similar parameters. Flexibility & Adaptability - The Dynamic Duo Your business isn’t static so why should your tools be? In our rapidly evolving world where job descriptions evolve frequently due to technological advancements or market changes, your evaluation forms must adapt too. If one position demands exceptional customer service while another needs proficiency in remote work technologies – make sure these unique aspects reflect in their respective forms. Regular updates based on new learnings about what works (and doesn't) will let you continually improve this important recruitment tool over time. It’s all about improving the functionality and time-to-hire . Having templated and updated evaluation forms will help with both of these things. Incorporating Team Collaboration Into Your Forms Evaluation isn't a solo sport. Encourage input from different stakeholders who interact with the candidate during various stages of the hiring process . The feedback can be used to make final decisions and also helps in building a more transparent, collaborative culture within your hiring team . Don't forget, feedback forms aren't just paperwork. When done right, they're strategic tools boosting both your company and candidates at every turn. Key Takeaway: Maximize your hiring success with top-notch evaluation forms . These aren't just checklists but tools to dig deep into a candidate's skills and fit for the company culture. Keep them relevant, objective, simple yet flexible to changing job requirements. Don't forget - collaboration is key. Input from all stakeholders can transform these forms into strategic assets that boost your hiring process . Navigating Background Checks and Identity Verification in Candidate Evaluations Background checks and identity verification are vital parts of candidate evaluations , especially with the rise of remote work. They ensure you're bringing onboard a qualified individual who meets your job requirements. These are necessary to confirm the information provided by candidates. The process involves looking into their criminal history, credit records, education verification and more. It helps hiring managers determine if a potential hire poses any risks to the company or its employees. But remember this - background checks should be conducted responsibly. Always comply with regulations like Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) guidelines during this part of evaluation process. Moving on to verifying candidate identity – an increasingly crucial aspect given our digital era. With many companies switching to virtual interviews due to COVID-19 restrictions, ensuring that candidates are indeed who they claim is paramount. The Need for Identity Verification in Remote Hiring The spike in remote work has made verifying candidate identity even more important than before, . We've all heard stories about people getting catfished online... but imagine it happening during your recruitment process . Yikes. A Comprehensive Approach Ensures Transparent Candidates Prioritize security by using secure platforms when conducting virtual interviews. Incorporate live video calls as part of interview process . Demand official identification documents from applicants early in the process. When evaluating candidates, remember to strike a balance between trust and skepticism. Yes, background checks and identity verification are necessary - but they should not replace other important aspects of candidate evaluations like soft skills assessment or culture fit evaluation. And that's the scoop, everyone. Dealing with background checks and confirming identities doesn't have to feel overwhelming. Key Takeaway: It's vital to double-check the background and confirm the identity of candidates, especially in remote work scenarios. These steps verify their details, making sure you're bringing on board skilled folks who won't jeopardize your company. But keep this in mind - always follow FCRA rules when running background checks. In today's digital age, it's equally important to authenticate a candidate’s identity. This is crucial for avoiding slip-ups during hiring processes . Assessing Skills and Potential during Candidate Evaluations Evaluating a candidate's skills and potential is like mining for gold. You're looking for those rare gems who will add value to your team, help drive growth, and fit well into the culture of your company. Evaluating Hard and Soft Skills Determining hard skills involves evaluating specific technical abilities. These are easily measurable through tests or reviewing job experience. However, assessing soft skills like communication or problem-solving can be trickier but equally important in the hiring process . A good approach is using targeted questions during interviews that allow qualified candidates to demonstrate their interpersonal capabilities. Talent Assessment Methods Various talent assessment methods exist that give us clues about a candidate's future performance. From structured interviews to task-based assessments, these tools offer valuable insights into a person’s aptitude beyond what’s visible on paper. In fact, stats indicate that talent assessment methods provide an accurate indication of a candidate's performance. Talent assessment isn't just guesswork; it has solid statistical backing. Remember: evaluation should always be transparent so each step must involve clear communication with applicants about what they entail. Hiring managers need all the support they can get when conducting evaluations - after all we’re human not supercomputers. So whether you choose manual methods or use advanced recruiting software remember - the aim is to find that golden nugget of talent. The Impact of Candidate Evaluations on Retention Rates When we think about hiring decisions , candidate evaluations often come to mind. These are not just about checking boxes for job requirements; they're also a vital tool in assessing a candidate's fit within the organization. But what's less talked about is how effective candidate assessments can have an influence far beyond the interview process . Yes, you read that right. They can actually play a significant role in your employee retention rates. Recent stats reveal that losing an entry-level worker could cost up to 50% of their annual salary. So if you thought recruitment was expensive, wait until you calculate turnover costs. A Deeper Look at Evaluation and Retention Connection Evaluating candidates isn't merely ticking off skills or qualifications from a list. It involves assessing soft skills and culture fit as well - elements critical for long-term retention . If done effectively, these evaluations provide insights into how well candidates align with your company values and work style—vital factors when it comes to employee satisfaction and commitment over time. Candidate Experience : The Unsung Hero Besides predicting job performance or cultural alignment, there's another hidden benefit linked with evaluation practices: shaping the overall candidate experience . Fairness: Candidates value transparency throughout the selection process. Predictability: Knowing what criteria they’re evaluated against provides them predictability. Dignity: When handled respectfully, even rejected applicants become potential brand ambassadors. A positive experience, thus, encourages candidates to stay on longer if hired and boosts your reputation among future job seekers . Make Retention the Ultimate Goal Look at evaluations differently - not just for hiring, but also as a way to boost retention rates. They're more than measuring candidate potential. They can help create a steady workforce, cut down on turnover costs, and even increase profits. Key Takeaway: Evaluations Matter : Not just a hiring tool, candidate evaluations help predict long-term fit and impact retention rates. They assess soft skills and culture compatibility, provide transparency for candidates, and enhance overall experience. Done right, they reduce turnover costs while building your brand's reputation.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/30/19 Q&A with Manny Favela, Co-Founder at Burrito Parrilla Mexicana Share this article Manny Favela served as Chief Financial Officer for McDonald's Latin America from 2004 up to his retirement in 2016. He was responsible for the Finance, I/T, Franchising and Development functions with over 2,200 restaurants and annual system-wide sales of over $5.0 billion dollars. During his 26-year career in the McDonald's System, Manny was a business partner and advisor to McDonald's Senior Management – he has extensive experience with Company Owned and Franchise Operations. His key responsibilities included monitoring the overall financial and related business performance, proactively addressing issues and concerns, and developing long range plans and strategic directions. As a business leader, Manny is an Entrepreneur and Co-Founder of Burrito Parrilla Mexicana, a Multi-Unit restaurant chain of Mexican Restaurants in the Western Suburbs of Chicago. Manny serves on the Boards of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Nuestro Queso LLC, a Hispanic Cheese Company. He is also involved in his community, serving on the Board of Elders at Wheaton Bible Church and was co-founder of the West Suburban Foundation for Disabled Veterans where he still serves as a Board Member. Manny is a CPA and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting from The University of Illinois in Chicago. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Manny: My biggest challenge was when we opened our first Burrito Parrilla Mexicana Restaurant. The business case made a lot of sense and I always assumed that if you had the right concept, executed well, and offered customers a great product, the business would perform well from the beginning. I underestimated the challenges of developing a new brand. We executed well, our restaurant looked great, employees were well paid and happy, and we provided great tasting fresh food, but our customers didn't know that. The business started very slowly, and we lost approximately $200,000 the in the first two years. My business partners were discouraged, and very reluctant to continue injecting capital into the business. Fortunately, I was able to look at the business from a different point of view and was encouraged as long as the sales continued to improve. Our food was great, and customers started to notice. They kept coming back and bringing others with them. After the first couple of years, our sales started to improve significantly, and we came across another opportunity for a second restaurant. Despite the concerns with the first location, I was able to convince my partners to move forward with the second restaurant, which started strong from the beginning. Now we have seven locations and two more are opening soon. Q: How you would describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? Manny: From the beginning of our business concept, it has been our mission to create an environment where our employees are treated with dignity and respect, and earn good wages. We encourage our employees to focus on providing great customer service and empower them to take risks and make decisions; such as providing free desserts when appropriate, giving customers extra condiments, replacing their meal if they don't like it, or even giving full refunds if they are still not satisfied. In addition, we made a commitment that if our business results allowed, we would implement a profit-sharing program with our key employees. Currently, we are taking 10% of our profits on a quarterly basis and giving them to our key employees as bonuses. These actions have resulted in a healthy work environment for our employees and a significantly lower turnover rate than most restaurants. Most of our employees really care about our entire organization. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: By hiring the right people, you can ensure that all staff provide top notch customer service at any time. Did you know that you can use video resumes as a pre-interview screening round? Get applicants to submit a quick self-introductory video, which is an easy way to determine who is genuinely interested in the position. This will also set apart bubbly candidates who are fit for the front lines. You can also make sure that all staff are aware of the standard customer service procedures, by implementing mobile training . Send handbooks and training videos via a text message link, so that employees can access them anywhere when required, and have a refresher course for how to react to various customer demands. This will create the best customer experience, and help new hires quickly identify scenarios and determine which response is best suited for them. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Manny: The restaurant industry is facing a very difficult time finding staff driven by a very low unemployment rate and a strong economy. It is currently more difficult than usual to find great employees. We are thankful that the work environment we have created, the higher wages, and bonuses that we pay, have made it easier for us to staff our restaurants. Most of our hires are referrals from our existing employees which is a testament of the working environment in our business. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Overcome the difficulty of finding staff by casting a wider net with text-to-apply posters . By printing out a custom poster to display at all store locations, visitors can easily scan the QR code, or text the number displayed to instantly view all open positions. You can further widen the net by utilizing job board integrations, which allow you to post to over 25,000 job boards with a single click. Conveniently view all applicants in one dashboard, and save time from copying and pasting to multiple job boards! If this still isn’t sufficient, an in-built smart sponsorship system will also use AI to optimize your job postings across multiple boards and social media sites, allowing you to get in front of as ten times as many job seekers, providing quality candidates. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Manny: I am a visionary and I always have a long-term view of our business. I can see where we are today and all the issues that we need to address. However, I spend most of my time focusing on where we need to be in five years and making sure that everything we do today is helping us take steps in that direction. Q: Who inspires you and why? Manny: I get inspired by various people at different times. I am a person of faith, so I get mostly inspired by the Gospel which provides meaning to my life, and a path of direction in all I do. I get inspired by my mother, who is a humble person. She raised us to see what truly has value and not just professional success, status and material possessions. She always promoted love and unity in the family. I get encouraged when I think about Martin Luther King and how much impact he had on our society. How he had the courage to fight for what he believed in despite the challenges and difficulties. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Manny: Yes, I had hourly jobs during my high school and college years. These jobs served as a strong foundation to what followed. I worked at a hot dog stand which helped me get an idea about what the restaurant business was like, and I also had a chance to meet the owner's accountant which motivated me to pursue this field. I worked at a spring factory operating various types of machines. The owner of the factory later gave me the opportunity to work in accounting once he realized I was studying accounting in college. I also worked for a mortgage company during my last year in College. Looking to scale your team, or create a powerhouse hiring process for your QSR?

The initial move is to establish explicit objectives for what you wish to accomplish with the software. Ensuring Proper Integration with Existing HR Systems An effective implementation strategy starts by integrating your AI recruiting tool into existing HR systems seamlessly. This ensures a smooth transition and helps prevent any hiccups during rollout. It's like merging two highways - if done correctly, traffic keeps flowing without major disruptions. In addition, proper integration can make sure all relevant data gets transferred accurately between systems. Think about it as ensuring that every passenger (data point) reaches their destination safely and on time. Remember: Even the most sophisticated AI system won't perform optimally without proper instruction. Similarly, understanding how an AI system works is key before hitting the \"go\" button. Providing Adequate Training You wouldn’t give someone keys to a jet plane without proper flight training, would you? Same applies here. Once integrated, providing adequate training for team members will help them get comfortable with its features faster. A good starting point might be having dedicated sessions where employees can play around with the software in real-time under guidance from experts or vendor representatives who have mastered its use already. Note: These trainings are not just one-off events but should continue regularly so everyone stays updated as new updates roll out or functionalities evolve over time. Maintaining Performance Monitoring Practices Last but definitely not least – keep track of performance. Just like you'd make assessments on a car's health regularly to make sure it's running smoothly, regular performance monitoring is critical in assessing the effectiveness of your AI hiring software. Monitoring can help identify areas where the system may be underperforming and need adjustments. Creating workflows can speed up this maintenance. After all, there’s no use having a race car if it doesn’t win races. Key Takeaway: To hit the ground running with your AI hiring software, make sure to define clear goals and blend it seamlessly into your current HR systems. Just like blending lanes on a freeway, you want an uninterrupted flow of work. Training is essential - picture this system as a high-performance race car that needs expert handling. Finally, always monitor performance for any tweaks needed; after all, what good is a top-of-the-line race car if Future Trends in AI Hiring Software The landscape of AI hiring software is continually evolving. We're seeing advancements that could reshape the way we hire, making it more efficient and candidate-friendly. Upwork's global talent pool , for instance, illustrates how AI can broaden the scope of talent acquisition beyond geographical boundaries. But this is just scratching the surface. Natural Language Processing (NLP) An exciting trend on the horizon is an enhanced use of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This technology allows machines to understand human language better than ever before, which means they'll be able to assess job descriptions and candidates' profiles with higher accuracy. This capability will make sure job seekers are matched accurately with open positions based on their skills rather than keyword matching alone - a boon for both recruiters and applicants. Predictive Analytics In addition to NLP, predictive analytics promises big things for recruitment. With these advanced algorithms , HR teams will be able to forecast potential employees' success rate within specific roles or departments before even starting the interview process. Beyond improving hiring decisions , this tech can also help reduce learning curves by identifying candidates who are likely already aligned with company culture and values. Candidate Experience Personalization Last but not least, personalization seems set to become a significant focus area in future recruiting efforts. By leveraging machine learning capabilities combined with vast amounts of data from public platforms like social media sites or career websites, AI tools will provide improved candidate experiences tailored specifically towards individual preferences. AI is reshaping hiring. From broadening talent search to using Natural Language Processing for precise matches, predictive analytics for potential success rates, and personalizing candidate experiences .

This in turn helped their general managers save a ton of time, allowing them to focus on other important tasks. Watch below to see how Workstream played a part and helped them achieve the hiring process of their dreams. Pieology is more than just a pizza place, you can choose from more than six different crusts, toppings, be creative and come together with family and friends. Employees are just the key to Pieology because they are the face of the brand. They take people down the line and help them with their creative experience. And because of that, we are hiring people all the time. By far hiring is our top challenge in the restaurant industry. Not only getting qualified applicants but getting back to them in a timely manner before they accept a job somewhere else. The managers work the line during lunch and dinner. And so by the time they call them back, they might have taken another position. And even if they do get in touch with them, finding a time for them to come in, the back and forth of setting the interview, our process was very tedious and antiquated. So we’re always looking for ways to improve our process for the managers. The general managers in our restaurant, they have a lot of operational responsibility every day. And with Workstream, we’ve really been able to take their focus and energy off of the hiring process and really streamline it so that they’re able to focus on the operational part of the business. When we’re putting out job postings, we put on multiple job boards. Workstream is able to filter those applicants and filter them down into one place and one calendar that our general managers can then manage from there. Bringing Workstream this year is a great decision. It really helped ease some of the frustration that our general managers had through the hiring process last year. We started Workstream last year at our Pieology stores as a test and we’re excited to roll it out to all the other brands that we own as well.
