It's important to remember that the Hourly Wage Index data above reflects gross wages, or the amount of money an employee earns before accounting for payroll deductions like taxes, benefits, or wage garnishments.

This question is a difficult one to answer, as a \"good hourly wage\" is highly subjective according to experience, work responsibilities, cost of living, and other factors. We recommend using Hourly Wage Index data as a starting point. Once you have established a baseline for certain positions, do further research into similar businesses in your area. Lastly, consider surveying your employees.

This distinction affects various aspects, including overtime eligibility , minimum wage, and employment rights. In this blog post, we will explore three general factors that play a significant role in determining  exempt vs. non exempt employees. What is the difference between exempt vs non-exempt Job Duties and Responsibilities: The first factor to consider when determining what is a non exempt employee employees is the nature of their job duties and responsibilities. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) provides guidelines to differentiate between exempt and nonexempt employees based on their primary job functions. Exempt employees typically perform executive, administrative, professional, or outside sales duties. Exempt employees are primarily engaged in managerial or supervisory roles, exercising independent judgment and decision-making authority. They are responsible for overseeing operations, setting policies, and directing the work of other employees. In contrast, nonexempt employees typically perform tasks that do not involve significant managerial or professional responsibilities. Salary Basis and Compensation: The second factor to consider when determining what is a non-exempt employee is the compensation structure. Exempt employees are generally paid on a salary basis and receive a predetermined amount for each pay period, regardless of the number of hours worked. This fixed salary ensures that exempt employees are compensated for their overall contribution and not just the number of hours worked. Nonexempt employees, on the other hand, are usually paid on an hourly basis and are entitled to receive overtime pay for any hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. They receive an hourly wage that meets or exceeds the applicable minimum wage requirements. FLSA Guidelines and Regulations: The third factor involves understanding the guidelines and regulations outlined in the Fair Labor Standards Act. The FLSA provides specific criteria and exemptions that determine whether an employee qualifies as exempt or nonexempt. It is essential for employers to familiarize themselves with these guidelines to ensure accurate and compliant classification. The FLSA regulations consider factors such as job duties, salary level, and salary basis. While job duties have already been discussed, the FLSA also establishes a minimum salary threshold for exempt employees. Currently, this threshold is set at $684 per week (or $35,568 annually) under federal law. However, it is important to note that certain states may have higher salary requirements. Read the scenario below and see if you are able to identify if Sara or John is an exempt employee. It is finally Friday night but Sara, a newly-employed editor at ABC Creative Studios is feeling a little stressed out. She has not finished her proposal that is due on Monday. Since she did not make any plans with anybody that night, she spent most of her Friday night editing and working on her proposal. On Monday – the day she gets her paycheck – she found out she got the same amount of money she would have gotten if she hadn't stayed late. Meanwhile on the same Friday in the same building, John, a maintenance worker, chooses to take an extra shift and work overtime. He doesn't have to, he could leave at 5p.m. if he wanted. However, on Monday, when he receives his paycheck, he knows he'll receive extra money from the overtime hours he had worked. If you recognized that Sara is an exempt employee while John is non-exempt, you are right. An exempt employee is an employee who is exempt from overtime pay and/or minimum wage, and other rights and protections afforded to nonexempt workers. They are usually paid a salary rather than hourly wage. The most common FLSA exemptions are also known as \"white collar exemptions\". Typically, exempt employees take up executive administrative, professional, outside sales positions in the company. Currently, according to the test guidelines provided by the website of FLSA, an employee has to make at least $455 a week ($23, 660 a year) [1] to be exempt. An exempt employee must be paid the same amount, or a minimum salary regardless of how many hours they work or how well they perform. They are not paid extra for putting it more than 40 hours per week, they're paid for getting the job done. For example, Sara is offered a basic salary with bonuses as further compensation. The benefits of course are obvious. Sara does not have to be concerned about what a drastic drop in hours worked that week will do to her paycheck. Furthermore, since they are compensated for the jobs they do and not the time it takes them, they often have a more flexible work environment than non-exempt employees. Sara's employer is understandably more interested in whether Sara completes her given task that week, such as finishing her proposal, instead of how long she took for her lunch break or if she left early the previous Friday. Let us talk about John now, who is compensated by the time he works. Non-exempt employees like John, as the term implies, are non-exempt from FLSA requirements. Employees in this category must be paid at least the minimum wage for each hour worked and given overtime pay of no less than one-and-a-half times their hourly rate for any hours worked beyond 40 each week. Although they typically receive hourly pay, employers can also pay them on a salary basis. They could also work in any field, although some sources indicate that most non-exempt employees are blue-collar workers. Non exempt vs exempt employee tests To reiterate, whether employees are exempt or non-exempt are dependent on these three \"tests\": 1. Salary level test Employees who are paid less than $23,600 are non-exempt. 2. Salary basis test If an employee has a \"guaranteed minimum\" amount of money he or she can count on receiving for any work week, the employee is exempt. 3. The duties test An employee who meets the two tests above is exempt only if he or she also performs exempt job duties. These FLSA exemptions are limited to employees who perform relatively high-level work. Do note that job titles or position descriptions are of limited usefulness in this determination. The three typical categories of exempt job duties are: a) Executive job duties Employee regularly supervises two or more other employees, has management as the primary duty of the position, and has some genuine input into the job status of other employees. b) Professional job duties Usually means work which is predominantly intellectual, requires specialized education and involves the exercise of discretion and judgement. Some employees may also perform \"creative professional\" job duties which are exempt, such as actors, musicians, composers, journalists, writers. (do note that this is not an exhaustive list.) c) Administrative job duties This classification is designed for relatively high-level employees whose main job is to \"keep the business running\". Examples include labor relations and personnel (human resources employees), payroll and finance, records maintenance, accounting and tax, marketing and advertising, just to name a few. Final Thoughts In general, both exempt and non-exempt employees receive basic protection from state and federal laws, but non-exempt employees enjoy better legal protection from the government. Unemployment benefits vary from state to state, but generally both exempt and nonexempt employees can collect unemployment benefits. Do check with your state's Department of Labor for more detailed information. Tax liabilities are the same for both categories as all pay is \"earned income\" and therefore taxable to the wage warner based upon the tax bracket. Whether you are an employee or an employer, as members of the workforce it is best to be informed. This article is intended to be a primer on this issue, but for more information, please visit the Department of Labor's site to address federal and state laws specific to your state. [1] Please note at this point to check applicable state laws as the salary basis requirements may vary.

This is especially true in the restaurant industry , which has the highest turnover rate of 50-100% a year. With constant hourly hiring needs taking up so much of your energy and attention, the right technology solution can save time, increase efficiency, and help you keep your restaurant staffed more easily. So, how do you find the right hiring software for your restaurant ? Let’s break down the attributes and features you should be looking for. Understanding your restaurant’s hiring needs The first step in selecting the right hiring software is understanding your business’s needs. As we mentioned, the restaurant industry is notorious for overwhelmingly high turnover rates. But that’s not the only challenge facing restaurant owners when it comes to hiring. Most quick-service restaurant employees are under 35 , often juggling school and work, which necessitates flexible scheduling. This age group's availability fluctuates seasonally, particularly around holidays, school breaks, and summer vacations, posing a unique challenge for restaurant owners . Additionally, these hourly workers are frequently looking for better-paying or more convenient positions, meaning you're constantly competing to retain your team members . To combat these issues, quick-service restaurants are known to spend over $3 billion a year on hiring and training, but it’s often not enough. What they really need are solutions for quick and efficient hiring to save time and money, set new employees up for success, and fill staffing needs as quickly as possible. Top restaurant hiring software features to look for The right restaurant hiring software can address many of the issues you routinely face when hiring hourly workers. But that doesn’t mean every hiring platform is created equal. Here are some key features to look for when you’re evaluating different software options: 1. Applicant tracking system (ATS) When looking for the right hiring software , an applicant tracking system , or ATS, is non-negotiable. At the very least, your hiring software should get applications out of your inbox and into an organized system where you can track how they’re moving through your hiring process . But an ATS can do much more than that. Automate tasks: A good ATS will streamline your hiring process from start to finish by automating many of the most time-consuming tasks like posting to job boards , sorting applications, and scheduling interviews . Save time: Automation is a big time-saver. But so is keeping digital records of your applicants in one place. A good ATS will keep you organized so you never lose a document or miss an interview. (This will also make onboarding a lot easier once a new hire accepts your offer!) 2. Mobile-friendly Almost 70% of applicants search for job openings on their phones and mobile apps . That means your hiring software needs to run flawlessly on mobile. Your application process should be easy to navigate, read, and apply with just a few taps. Your job applications should not only be easy to complete but also fast. Candidates have a 15-minute attention span when it comes to filling out applications. If your experience is clunky and hard to fill out from the convenience of their phone, there’s a good chance they’ll abandon ship. 3. Built-in communication tools Good communication is your number one tool to keep applicants engaged during the hiring process . And when applicants are applying to multiple hourly positions at the same time, keeping them engaged in your opening is critical. A good restaurant hiring software will have communication tools built in. Look for a mix of automation and easy personalization. Automation : Transactional messages are important in the hiring process . They communicate and confirm important information, like letting an applicant know you’ve received their application or enabling interview scheduling via text. You don’t want to skip these messages. In fact, reaching out to an applicant within the first hour of receiving their application increases your chances of hiring them by 25%. But who has time to do that for every application they receive? That’s why you should look for hiring software that automates these types of transactional messages for you, saving you time while keeping applicants engaged. Personalization: Balancing transactional messages with personal ones is key to any communication strategy. Applicants are 160x more likely to accept an offer if they have a personal conversation with the hiring managers . So, how can hiring software help you do that? Look for platforms that have messaging built-in so you don’t have to use your personal number to communicate with every applicant. (That’s a nightmare!) Your hiring software will centralize all these communications and tie them to applicant records so you can stay organized as you manage all your potential hires. 4. Compliance management features Staying compliant with hiring regulations is crucial in the restaurant industry , where labor laws and regulations are constantly evolving. Hiring software helps you navigate these complexities effortlessly, ensuring that your recruitment process meets all legal requirements. One of the primary compliance issues in the restaurant industry is the correct classification of employees. Misclassifying employees as independent contractors to save on taxes can lead to severe penalties. Hiring software helps you manage this by maintaining accurate records and providing clear guidelines on employee classification. It also streamlines the process of collecting and storing essential documentation like W-4 forms for tax withholding and I-9 forms for verifying employment eligibility. Automating these tasks reduces the risk of errors and ensures that all employee information is accurately documented and easily accessible. 5. Customization and integrations There is no business quite like yours, so your restaurant hiring software shouldn’t be one-size-fits-all. Look for software that allows you to customize every detail of your hiring process, like which roles need assessments and panel interviews and which ones allow applicants to self-schedule their own interviews. Not every role at your business will have the same requirements, and your hiring software should accommodate that flexibility. In addition to customizations, be sure to check how the hiring software you’re vetting integrates with your existing HR tools , especially if it’s not an all-in-one software suite. Having to manually transfer data or input information over and over into different systems is a big waste of time and leaves you open to errors. Hiring software that integrates with your record-keeping, payroll, and scheduling tools will save you time and headaches. 6. Ease of use Restaurant hiring software is only as good as it is easy to use. If your hiring software isn’t easy to use, it’ll create problems for applicants and your hiring staff. Long, clunky applications will scare qualified candidates away. And software that isn't intuitive and requires excessive training will frustrate your staff and they might even avoid using it. Even worse, if the automation and notifications are too hard to set up, your applicants could get stuck in certain hiring stages, increasing your time-to-hire and hurting your hiring conversion rate. Your software reflects your effectiveness and thoroughness as a business—a seamless and intuitive interface is vital for applicants and administrators. 7. Customer support and training On that same note, when you inevitably encounter a question about software functionality or experience an issue with your hiring solution, you need a way to resolve your problem quickly. Selecting software that offers reliable customer support and training resources will directly correlate with how successfully you can adopt it throughout the business. Responsive customer support can make all the difference when it comes to troubleshooting issues and maximizing the effectiveness of the software. 8. Fair pricing When shopping for your restaurant hiring software , you’ll likely encounter various pricing models, making it hard to compare solutions and see which deal is best for you. Some charge per employee or location, while others offer a base price and then upcharge for the features you really want. Take the time to understand the cost-effectiveness of the different restaurant hiring platforms you’re evaluating based on the features and benefits they offer. Being able to prove the ROI of your software investment to stakeholders or partners will depend on your ability to understand what you’re paying for—and avoid any surprise additional fees. Finding the right restaurant hiring software is t he secret to an efficiently run restaurant From cost to customer support, ease of use, integration options, and beyond, there are many things you must consider when choosing the best hiring solution for your restaurant. But with the right technology by your side, you can hire faster, stay staffed, and even lower your turnover rate by hiring smarter from the start and freeing up time to provide a top-notch employee experience.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 02/27/24 Embracing AI: Why now is the time for QSR Share this article When compared to the 13% turnover rate average across other U.S. industries, the 150% rate experienced in the quick-service restaurant industry is staggering. Even if this trend comes as no surprise to industry veterans, that doesn’t mean we should all just accept it. Especially when the implementation of emerging technologies like AI can positively influence employees’ feelings and attitudes at work—while consistently improving worker retention in the process. Artificial intelligence is often discussed in the media for its ability to eliminate manual work. Yet, its true potential lies in the power to assist managers and help balance their workloads—rather than take over work entirely. In fact, AI can become a major asset to the behind-the-scenes functions of a restaurant by helping retain the valuable employees that help operations thrive. Why QSR workers are dissatisfied The reasons for the QSR industry’s historically high turnover rates are varied and complex. Some of the primary issues that often contribute to the problem are poor communication with employers, lack of scheduling flexibility, and the inability to share feedback. Plus, when you’re continually understaffed, it makes it harder for you and your existing team to fulfill everyday responsibilities, be available for guests, and keep operations running smoothly. The bottom line? Just like anyone else, QSR workers want a say in how their jobs fit with their personal lives and professional needs. Meeting hourly employees where they are—on their phones—by automating tedious tasks like scheduling or onboarding can make all the difference. AI can cater to Gen Z’s preferred communication style Communicating with employees through phone calls or emails can be horribly inefficient. Gen Z workers (and most Millennials) typically see phone calls as unwelcome intrusions. By not talking on the phone, they avoid verbal confrontations or awkward conversations—at the risk of missing important, helpful, or timely messages in the process. This is where AI comes in. Two-way text with automation is a great solution as it allows you to engage with hourly workers on their terms. Although they’re constantly online, social media interactions have primed them to prefer instant chat over checking emails. With the right AI-based HR tech stack , employees and managers can communicate in real-time, refer to past conversations, and always stay informed. AI can streamline shift scheduling Scheduling shifts for your staff can be one of the more irritating and surprisingly complex tasks faced by managers. The QSR industry is no exception. No matter what you come up with, you deal with frustrated workers, coverage gaps, constant absences, and impromptu turnover. It also means more back-office work and ongoing negotiation. In turn, less face time with workers. AI can help you keep up with the changing needs, preferences, and availability of your employees. Using historical data to examine how busy your business is from day to day along with the number of employees on staff to fill those hours, AI can auto-generate schedules and enable your employees to provide input in choosing their regular schedules, applying for open ones, or trading shifts. AI can create a culture of feedback Because of the fast-paced nature of QSR jobs, it can prove challenging for workers (and managers alike) to make time to give or receive feedback . Feedback not only encourages communication, but correction for all parties. It’s not always easy for managers to see what needs to change or where to improve when it comes to keeping their employees engaged. AI tools automate how you receive feedback by sending out surveys on a recurring basis to gauge worker satisfaction and address concerns before they lead to turnover. How to introduce AI to employees The potential uses for artificial intelligence within the QSR industry are growing each day. Especially for guest-facing customer-service employees. You can start by using AI technology for your own back-office work by automating time-consuming tasks and reducing errors. If you introduce AI-based tools during those first interactions with would-be employees (like the applicant stage ), you get added opportunities to familiarize people with the technology’s benefits. Let them experience artificial intelligence firsthand as they fill out applications and schedule their own interviews automatically. The time to consider using AI Is now Despite its mixed coverage in the media, AI’s functionality and practicality will only continue to increase—as will its use and growing acceptance. Of course, this doesn’t mean that artificial intelligence will replace the human aspect of the QSR industry. With a clear vision and thorough strategy from restaurant management, AI can greatly support a restaurant’s various functions and staff, which ultimately reduces both turnover rates and operational costs—reason enough to keep the possibilities open and introduce AI technologies to your workforce .

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 09/12/23 Hiring Hacks: 7 ATS integrations to streamline your hiring process Share this article Unlocking the full potential of your hiring process requires strategically integrating essential tools that enhance efficiency, compliance, and the applicant experience . In today's fast-paced business landscape, where every hire counts, leveraging technology to its fullest is paramount. Let’s explore the transformative impact of integrating key functionalities into your applicant tracking system (ATS) . From seamless background checks to automated onboarding, from mobile recruiting to dynamic video interviews, we'll delve into the power of these integrations and equip your organization with the tools it needs to thrive in the competitive world of hourly recruitment. 1. Background checks Background checks help you make informed decisions and maintain a secure work environment. By integrating background check services directly into your ATS, you can offer peace of mind to management and customers alike. An ATS integration with a reputable background check provider like Checkr can significantly boost efficiency. It allows managers to track the progress of background checks and view results transparently. Moreover, by integrating these tools into your hiring process, you reduce the risk of human error and enhance data security, ensuring sensitive applicant information is handled with the utmost confidentiality. 2. E-Verify For employers in the United States, verifying employee eligibility to work is a legal requirement. E-Verify is a government program that helps employers confirm the work eligibility of new hires. Integrating E-Verify into your ATS simplifies this process and ensures compliance with state regulations. E-Verify provides a legal framework for confirming employment eligibility and helps maintain a legal workforce, which is crucial for businesses. 98.3% of work-authorized employees are confirmed immediately or within 24 hours through E-Verify. This swift verification process helps expedite the onboarding of eligible new hires, reducing delays and eliminating potential compliance issues. Look for an ATS that acts as an E-Verify Employer Agent, enabling the system to submit new hire verification on your behalf. You can seamlessly complete the necessary steps without leaving your ATS platform by incorporating E-Verify into your onboarding process. 3. WOTC The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a valuable tax credit offered by the US government to employers who hire individuals from target groups, such as veterans or those with previous involvement in the criminal justice system . Despite the potential benefits, many companies miss out on claiming WOTC due to the cumbersome paperwork involved. According to a US Department of Labor report, approximately 20% of new hires are eligible for WOTC , making it a valuable opportunity for businesses to save on their tax expenses. However, manually completing the required paperwork can be time-consuming and error-prone. An ATS integration with WOTC.com can be a game-changer, as it automates the entire process, ensuring you don't miss out on eligible tax credits. By using an integrated ATS and WOTC platform, you not only save time but also improve the accuracy of the information submitted. The ATS can automatically identify eligible candidates based on specific criteria, streamlining the process and maximizing your chances of claiming the tax credit. 4. Payroll Smoother payroll processes mean less time spent on administrative tasks and more focus on strategic HR initiatives. If you're still manually entering worker information from your ATS into your payroll provider, it's time to give your keyboard a break. Manual data entry increases the risk of errors and consumes valuable time that HR professionals could otherwise dedicate to improving the worker experience. Integrating your ATS with your payroll system streamlines the flow of data, eliminating the need for duplicate entries and reducing the risk of errors. This integration ensures that employee information, including hours worked and compensation, seamlessly transfers from your ATS to payroll, saving time and effort for HR professionals. 5. Onboarding automation The onboarding process sets the tone for a new hire's experience and significantly impacts their long-term engagement with the company. By integrating onboarding automation tools into your ATS, you can create a seamless and personalized onboarding journey for new hourly employees. With the help of an integrated ATS, you can automate essential onboarding tasks, such as collecting tax forms, signing company policies , and setting up training modules. This streamlined process saves time and ensures that new employees feel welcomed and supported from day one, leading to higher retention rates and increased productivity. 6. Mobile recruiting A mobile-friendly ATS allows you to reach a broader pool of applicants who prefer to search for jobs and apply on their smartphones or tablets. According to a report by Glassdoor , 58% of job seekers use mobile devices to search for jobs at least once daily. Furthermore, 35% of applicants have applied for a job directly from their mobile devices. Integrating mobile recruiting into your ATS allows you to tap into this mobile-savvy applicant pool and provide a user-friendly application process, enhancing the overall candidate experience. Recruiters can also review applications, schedule interviews, and communicate with applicants on the go, improving efficiency and responsiveness. 7. Video interviewing Incorporating video interviewing tools into your ATS can revolutionize how you conduct initial applicant assessments. Video interviews provide a more dynamic and personal touch to the hiring process, allowing you to gauge an applicant’s communication skills, body language, and cultural fit. ATS integrations with video interviewing platforms enable recruiters to easily schedule, conduct, and review video interviews within the same system. This saves time and allows for better collaboration among hiring teams, leading to more informed hiring decisions. Bring your HR tools together for a streamlined HR experience Investing in these must-have hourly ATS integrations can significantly improve your recruiting process, making it more efficient, compliant, and applicant-friendly. By consolidating essential HR functions within a single platform, you can streamline operations, reduce manual tasks, and focus on what truly matters: finding the best hourly employees to help your business thrive.

Although the idea of managing employee payments and paying yourself a wage each month can tip some business owners over the edge. But don’t panic, payroll software is a business game-changer and can take the hard work out of managing hourly employees and paying yourself a monthly wage. While you might think of payroll software as a ‘nice-to-have’ solution, in today’s world, it really is a necessity, especially when hiring remote, virtual, and hourly employees to grow and support your company. So, let’s dive into what payroll software is, its key benefits, and how it is transforming the way companies manage their finances. The Rising Demand For Professional Payroll Software The need for payroll services and digital solutions has seen a significant rise recently, largely driven by an increase in startups, more entrepreneurs entering the market, and a growing number of hourly and seasonal employees entering the workforce. This trend has been further amplified by the global pandemic, which has led to a surge in virtual and remote team uptake. Yet, there are still some business owners sticking to outdated software and traditional bookkeeping methods rather than upgrading to digital payroll software . While it’s nice to be traditional, when it comes to managing business finances, it’s not the time to keep things ‘how they’ve always been’. In fact, failing to use reliable payroll software can actually have significant drawbacks for a business. The Risk Of Not Using Payroll Software Inaccuracies in payroll can lead to employee dissatisfaction and, in turn, affect a company's reputation as an employer. There is nothing worse than working for several weeks, excited to get paid, but when payday comes, your finances fail to reflect your hard work! A problem with employee pay can ruin relationships at work and lead to a lack of trust and employee resentment. That’s why guaranteeing your team is paid correctly and on time is critical for your employee retention rate. Moreover, incorrect payroll management can result in legal complications, including fines and legal action, especially if there are errors in tax calculations or non-compliance with labor laws. For businesses, especially those navigating the complexities of remote work and managing diverse employment types, adopting robust payroll software isn't just a convenience, it's a necessity to ensure smooth operations and maintain a good standing legally and reputationally. Understanding Payroll Software So now we know why it’s important to incorporate payroll software , let’s talk about what this software is, how it works, and its key business benefits. What is payroll and why is it important? Well, at its core , payroll is the process by which employers pay their employees. It involves the calculation of wages, withholding of taxes, and distribution of payments. Payroll software automates these processes, ensuring accuracy and compliance with various legal requirements. But how does payroll software actually work? Basically, it streamlines and automates the entire payroll process . From calculating hourly employee wages based on time tracking tools to handling tax withholdings and direct deposits , payroll software simplifies what used to be a time-consuming task.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 11/21/23 The Importance of Employee Feedback: Examples and Best Practices Share this article Do your employees seem checked out and disengaged? Are stellar employees starting to quietly quit by doing the bare minimum required? Is your workforce just going through the motions rather than actively driving business results? If so, your organization likely has an urgent problem with providing impactful employee feedback . Without constructive feedback and praise, employees feel directionless. Their performance stagnates, and morale plummets. It makes sense, after all. What employee would choose a work environment where their contributions are taken for granted, and they never receive recognition? With nearly half of those leaving their current roles quitting “quietly,” it’s clear that employees are looking for more than regular salary checks and benefits packages. The good news is feedback doesn't have to be complicated. The most effective communication techniques center around transforming feedback from negative criticism into actionable advice. Simple changes in wording can make employees feel valued and supported while also helping them identify areas of improvement. In this guide to revamping your internal feedback process , we'll cover: Best practices for providing employee feedback Tips for crafting a positive yet impactful message Strategies for improving your internal feedback culture By the end of this guide, you'll be well on your way to creating an environment that encourages growth and development through active employee engagement beyond typical employee performance reviews . With the right feedback mechanisms, you can enhance your company culture and create a sense of ownership among team members . Why Employee Feedback Matters Employee feedback should be an integral part of your culture, not just an annual ritual. If you want to see your team members thrive in their roles, you’ll need to get strategic about how you check in with direct reports . When you implement effective employee feedback , you’ll see: Improved Employee Performance Consistent employee feedback enables continuous improvement of skills, efficiency, and outcomes. Rather than waiting for yearly reviews, regular feedback allows course correction along the way. For example, an engineering manager might provide monthly feedback to help technicians troubleshoot issues more effectively. This refinement accumulates into major performance gains over time. Without regular feedback and constructive criticism , employees operate based on assumptions of what good performance entails. Quality suffers when not actively calibrated. Boosts in Employee Engagement Gallup research shows employees who receive regular feedback and career development support are 3.5 times more likely to be engaged at work. They feel invested in, listened to, and empowered to grow. Even negative feedback — when delivered in an actionable way — can help build better relationships between a manager and their team. Feedback demonstrates to employees their opinions and contributions matter to leadership. This drives engagement, productivity, and discretionary effort. On the flip side, a lack of feedback causes employees to disengage, unsure of expectations or progress. They become unmotivated and do the bare minimum required — resulting in lower employee experience and dips in entire team morale. Develops Employee Talents Constructive feedback that highlights an employee’s strengths provides a roadmap for maximizing those talents. For example, praise for a salesperson’s rapport with clients encourages further sharpening of emotional intelligence. When employees know their stand-out abilities, they can hone them into true competitive advantages, both for individual and company success. Feedback opens up growth opportunities — and a positive attitude can help activate those moments when combined with actionable insights. Without feedback, employees operate in the dark about their strengths. Unclear about paths for advancement, top performers seek growth opportunities elsewhere. Boosts Employee Retention Speaking of talent retention, employees who feel their professional growth is stagnant or hindered quickly look for opportunities at other organizations. Consistent feedback shows a path forward and demonstrates the company’s commitment to development. Even if pay raises aren’t feasible, consistent feedback provides the growth and progression employees crave from their jobs. It shows you’re invested in their futures within your organization, and can help to enhance employee retention rather than lose top talent to competitors. Aligns Employees with Company Values Effective feedback not only focuses on individual employee performance but also reinforces alignment with company values and culture. For example, offering praise when an employee demonstrates great teamwork improves collaboration company-wide. Values-focused feedback clarifies expected behaviors. Without it, organizational values remain just words on a wall, not guides for employee actions. Feedback brings values alive. Identifies Problems Early Finally, providing ongoing feedback gives managers insight into problems as they emerge. Issues can be swiftly addressed rather than allowed to spiral. For example, early feedback can nip absenteeism or waning customer service in the bud before reaching severe levels. Even small course corrections downstream prevent major problems upstream, where solutions are more costly and time-consuming. Rather than relying on human resources to create and implement feedback tools , leaders who take on this responsibility demonstrate a commitment to creating and sustaining a values-driven culture. What Feedback Should I Give to My Employees? Knowing how employee feedback is only part of the battle. The other side is knowing the type of feedback to give. Simply giving project-specific feedback is not enough. The best feedback provides supportive guidance for employees to help with professional development. It should also be concise, timely, and specific to the individual to demonstrate the care and attention needed to build trust. When determining what feedback to give team members , aim to balance positive reinforcement and constructive suggestions. Positive Feedback This focuses on what an employee is doing well. Examples include: Praise for achievements: Give kudos when goals are met or projects completed successfully. Recognize the effort. Compliments on skills: Highlight specific strengths and talents you want the employee to continue leveraging. Appreciation for teamwork: Express gratitude for collaboration, knowledge sharing, mentoring, etc. Recognition of growth: Note when you observe progress on developmental areas for the employee. Admiration for values: Applaud demonstrating company values like excellence, respect, or innovation. Constructive Feedback This focuses on areas for improvement and growth. Examples include: Performance issues: Identify any deficiencies in quality, efficiency, outcomes, behaviors, etc. and offer advice to resolve them. Skill gaps: Note where an employee lacks proficiency in a required ability and suggest training to close the gaps. Overused strengths: Even strengths can become weaknesses when overused. Reign in as needed. Blind spots: Make employees aware of unrecognized weaknesses holding them back from advancement. Alignment with values: Course correct behaviors that are misaligned with company culture and values. While positive and constructive feedback are the most common types of employee feedback , they are by no means the only ones. Here are some other types of actionable feedback that can be implemented in your performance management : Growth feedback - Provide guidance to help employees develop new skills or expand their responsibilities. For example, suggesting an employee shadow other roles or take on stretch assignments. Course correction feedback - Gently realign employee behavior or work products that have drifted off track from expectations. Effort feedback - Recognize extra time, energy, and care an employee puts into their work. Hard work and diligence should be acknowledged. Complimentary feedback - Praise an employee's collaborations with colleagues, mentoring, knowledge sharing, and other actions that build team cohesion. Values reinforcement - Reference how an employee's actions reflect important company values like integrity, excellence, respect, etc. Goal-setting feedback - Have periodic discussions about progress on goals and resetting objectives as needed. Self-assessment feedback - Incorporate feedback from the employee about their own perceived strengths and weaknesses. Forward-looking feedback - Provide insight to help employees prepare for future opportunities and challenges on the horizon. Feedback Delivery: When Should Employee Feedback Be Given? The optimal cadence and scenarios for delivering feedback will vary by company culture . The key is integrating it holistically rather than siloing feedback to yearly reviews. From small, immediate acknowledgments to more formal check-ins , the key is finding the balance. Day-to-Day Interactions Don't reserve feedback only for formal reviews. Look for opportunities to offer praise or constructive advice during regular interactions. For example, compliment an employee's presentation skills after a meeting or email a new hire reinforcing their strong customer service. This real-time reinforcement sticks better than delayed feedback. Team meetings — be they standup syncs, Slack chats, or scheduled gatherings — are also great moments to provide feedback. During your team's meetings, focus on engaging each member in conversation and providing actionable advice that can be implemented right away. Project Completion Do you find that the employee is constantly missing deadlines? Or, do they often exceed expectations for project completion? Whatever the case may be, use this moment to give feedback. Explain how the employee should adjust their approach in order to meet goals or improve the quality of future work. Goal Setting Discussions Schedule regular performance check-ins with employees to review individual and team goals. This open dialogue gives you a chance to assess progress and provide guidance on what an employee can do differently moving forward. Go beyond just discussing goals; engage employees in understanding why a goal is important. Clarifying objectives helps employees stay focused and motivated throughout the evaluation process. Probationary Period Check-Ins Have more frequent touchpoints with new hires during their first 3 months. Early feedback accelerates their growth and provides course correction if needed. Having a review process that offers honest feedback will lead to better retention and a successful onboarding experience. Regular Performance Conversations Organize consistent conversations with employees to review their work, align on objectives, and identify opportunities for development. Setting aside time for these regular reviews helps direct an employee’s performance and creates an environment of open communication between leaders and team members . If an employee demonstrates a skills gap, values misalignment, or other problem, address it promptly through feedback. Nipping issues in the bud prevents bigger headaches down the road. Preparing for Reviews Provide informal feedback in the weeks leading up to formal mid-year or annual performance reviews . This eliminates surprise and sets the employee up to succeed. During one-on-one meetings , you can offer an open feedback channel that sets the stage for an honest dialogue. Reviews are a great time for checking on employee satisfaction via employee engagement surveys . These standardized employee feel checks offer key insights into the employee experience and can help managers proactively address any potential issues. Leadership Check-ins Employee feedback shouldn’t be regulated to just frontline employees and their direct supervisors. Critical feedback across leadership can help to foster a culture of feedback that trickles down to the bottom line. Anonymous feedback channels can help encourage honest dialogue, and regular check-ins with employees can help create an atmosphere of trust and respect. Managers should receive brief weekly or bi-weekly feedback from their own leaders focused on priorities, challenges, and team dynamics. Periodic Surveys Conduct anonymous pulse surveys every 1-2 months to gather broad feedback on what the team is doing well and areas for improvement. These are a great way to measure sentiment, identify key themes, and determine if any topics require further exploration. As a feedback loop , these surveys create an important connection between the top and bottom levels of the organization. Times of Transition Change management is a crucial element of high-performing teams, and internal communication plays a major role in the process. When roles change through promotion , reorganization or taking on new projects, discuss transitions through feedback on strengths to leverage in the new situation. What is an example of good employee feedback ? So, know that you know why to offer feedback and when to engage, what are some positive employee feedback examples ? Let’s look at a variety of positive behavior and constructive employee feedback examples that you can use to guide your own communication skills . What are some examples of positive feedback ?

Your hard work is inspiring!\" \"I'm thoroughly impressed with how you coordinated our corporate volunteer event. Feedback from employees has been overwhelmingly positive. You make our culture shine!\" Complimenting Skills \"You have a natural talent for explaining technical concepts in a way everyone can understand. Your presentation demystified a complex topic. Keep refining this skill.\" \"You never cease to amaze me with your graphic design capabilities. The infographics you created make the data truly come to life visually.\" Appreciating Values \"I admire your commitment to transparency and integrity even when tackling difficult situations. You consistently model our values.\" \"You demonstrated incredible patience and understanding dealing with that angry customer. Thank you for preserving our reputation through your professionalism.\" Recognizing Growth \"I've noticed a real improvement in how you collaborate cross-functionally the past few months. It's great to see you applying the feedback we've discussed.\" \"Your speaking skills during the town hall were excellent - poised, smooth pacing, good eye contact.

But sometimes, spending too much time perfecting a report means missing deadlines. Let's discuss balancing thoroughness with pace.\" \"You raise thoughtful objections during brainstorms. Make sure to balance critical thinking with openness so creativity still flows.\" Improving Blindspots \"What if you took some time to focus on your leadership skills through a course? This could help you take your managerial ability to the next level!” \"You have a lot of product expertise but tend to get bogged down in details during client presentations. Work on tailoring your message to audience needs.\" Aligning Values \"You have great relationships across teams, but some colleagues perceive your jokes as unprofessional. Let's refocus on our value of mutual respect.\" \"I know you want to support your team, but overriding policies that apply to everyone undermines our culture of fairness. Let's discuss in our next two-way meeting.\" Building an employee feedback template for your processes Want to start putting these employee feedback principles into practice? Start by creating an employee feedback template that outlines a standard structure for giving and receiving feedback. Your template should include: • Opening statement to set the tone • Areas of improvement • Positive reinforcement • Actionable steps for improvement • Closing statement to emphasize points discussed This way, employees have a clear understanding of what to expect when receiving feedback, and can track their progress over time as they work on areas identified. With this tool in place, managers have consistent language for delivering feedback and can foster open conversations with employees. Consider building a method by which to track metrics once you have established a feedback process . For instance, you could gather employee sentiment data via surveys to measure the overall impact of your program and gauge employees’ experience with feedback sessions. This will enable you to make more strategic decisions on how best to improve your brand voice with each interaction. Never Underestimate the Power of Quality Feedback The key is to create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their opinions and offering constructive criticism . When everyone is on the same page about expectations and goals, it's much easier for teams to collectively work towards greater success while maintaining a cohesive culture. Take the above tips and insights and start creating your own employee feedback mechanisms that take your organization to the next level. From improved team member morale to higher talent retention, you can’t afford not to focus on your brand voice. With the right approach and dedication, you’ll be well on your way to a stronger, more unified organization!

Imagine kitchens where orders are communicated flawlessly, front desks that handle guest information with utmost security, and management teams collaborating efficiently—all thanks to secure chat apps . Now, imagine that this same level of secure, streamlined communication extends to every corner of the hospitality world. From coordinating room services in luxury hotels to managing last-minute table reservations in busy restaurants, secure chat apps are transforming the way staff interact and operations are conducted. This isn't just about convenience; it's about creating an environment where every message, every piece of data, is transmitted with the highest level of security and confidence. Join us as we reveal the 'what,’ 'why,’ and 'how' of secure chat applications, and why they're indispensable in today's fast-evolving hospitality world. The What: Understanding Secure Chat In a world where over 80% of hospitality professionals emphasize the importance of technology in enhancing guest experience, secure chat apps are not just tools, but game changers. But before we delve into the multitude of benefits they bring to the hospitality sector and its hourly workforce, let's first figure out what secure chat is. Secure chat is a method of digital communication designed to protect information from being intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties. This technology encrypts messages, ensuring that only the intended recipients can read them. Think of it like sending a letter in a locked box, where only the recipient has the key. In the hospitality and restaurant industry, the exchange of confidential information is as common as the clinking of glasses in a busy dining room. From the moment a guest makes a reservation, personal details like contact information, payment data, and even special occasion notes start flowing through the communication channels. This information is not just any data; it's trust placed by guests in the hands of those who promise them an unforgettable experience. From the front desk to the kitchen, secure chat ensures that this trust is not broken. It acts as a shield, protecting sensitive information from potential leaks or cyber threats. This is crucial in an era where data breaches are not just a possibility, but a common occurrence. The Important Role of Secure Chat in Hospitality Operations In the high-energy environment of the hospitality industry, every interaction counts, and this is where secure chat becomes indispensable. For anyone hiring hourly employees, the importance of secure chat cannot be overstated. Hiring hourly employees often involves a high turnover rate and a constant need for quick, effective communication. Secure chat facilitates this by providing a reliable and confidential way for managers to coordinate with staff, share schedules, and relay important updates in real time. This is crucial in maintaining a smooth operation, especially in peak hours or during special events when every second counts. Let’s find out what else makes secure chat an essential component in managing hourly employees in the hospitality industry. Streamlining Communication with Secure Chat Every day, busy restaurants and hotels buzz with a flurry of activities and constant communication. Hourly workers, from chefs to front desk staff, are at the heart of this buzz. They need a way to talk to each other that's quick, dependable, and private. Secure chat apps provide just that, making everyday chats easier and safer. Secure chat apps are accessible on various platforms, including Android and iOS devices, and provide a flexible and secure medium for instant messaging . This is especially important in scenarios such as discussing shift changes or responding to customer requests. Moreover, features like group chats make it easier for teams to stay connected and informed. Whether it's a quick update about a menu change or coordinating a large group booking, secure chat apps like WhatsApp , Telegram , or iMessage facilitate seamless and secure group communication. This is crucial in an industry where time-sensitive decisions and rapid responses can significantly impact service quality and guest satisfaction. Secure Chat : Enhancing Guest Experiences The role of secure chat in enriching guest experiences in the hospitality industry is substantial. When employees can communicate swiftly and securely, using platforms such as WhatsApp , Viber , or Threema , the service they provide becomes notably more efficient and responsive. This enhanced communication directly benefits the guests. For example, when a guest uses a hotel’s messaging service to make a special request, this message can be securely shared among staff using a secure chat app . Such apps, which are often multi-platform , allow the message to be accessed by employees whether they're on an Android phone , iPhone , or using a MacOS or Windows system. This ensures that the guest’s request is promptly attended to, providing a personalized service that is likely to be remembered and appreciated. Secure chat apps often come with an array of features that further assist in improving guest service. Functions like file sharing can be used to instantly send a guest’s room preferences or dietary needs directly to the relevant department. Advanced security features , such as end-to-end encryption and self-destructing messages , ensure that sensitive information like phone numbers or credit card details are kept confidential. Another advantage of using secure chat apps is the ability to send notifications and updates directly to a guest's mobile device . This can include everything from room ready alerts to reminders about their dining reservations. Some secure chat apps even allow for more engaging interactions with features like stickers , emojis , or the ability to conduct video chats , making the guest experience more interactive and enjoyable. Compliance and Liability Reduction with Secure Chat In an industry rife with legal and privacy concerns, secure chat is the ultimate convenience. Laws and regulations around data protection are stringent, and for good reason. A secure chat app follows strict laws like GDPR and HIPAA, cutting down the chances of data leaks and the legal problems that can come with them. Using secure chat apps with open-source encryption makes things even safer. This means the code behind the app is out there for regular checks, keeping the encryption tough against new online threats. The most important part of these apps is end-to-end encryption . This keeps all the details guests share – like their phone numbers and credit card info – safe from start to finish. These apps also use advanced ways to make sure the right person is getting access. Features like QR code scans or fingerprint checks mean that only the right staff can see sensitive info, even if they’re on different devices or using public Wi-Fi . Handling Emergencies with Secure Chat in Hospitality Emergencies within hospitality settings, such as restaurants and hotels, require swift and confidential communication. Secure chat apps are indispensable in these high-stress situations, offering a quick way to relay crucial information while ensuring privacy and discretion. This becomes particularly important in a chat restaurant environment or any busy hospitality setting where quick decision-making is key. In restaurant kitchens, for instance, secure chat enables chefs to quickly address issues like ingredient shortages by coordinating through private messaging apps or even video calls with suppliers. This minimizes service disruptions, preserving the dining experience. Hotel emergencies, such as maintenance issues, require discreet management to maintain guest comfort. Secure chat apps , accessible on a range of devices, including Apple and Linux systems, facilitate this. Staff can use these apps, from mobile apps to specialized platforms like Wickr Me , to communicate via text, voice, or video, ensuring a controlled response to unexpected situations. Moreover, the secure backup of these communications, possibly on cloud services like iCloud or servers in privacy-focused countries like Switzerland , is essential for audits and post-incident reviews. This process helps in understanding the handling of situations and identifying areas for improvement. Secure chat , therefore, doesn't just facilitate immediate crisis management; it also contributes to long-term operational learning and development in the hospitality industry. Getting Started with Secure Chat in the Hospitality Industry Now that you're aware of the importance of secure chat in hospitality, let's explore how to get started. This section guides you through selecting the right platform, ensuring data security, and integrating these systems smoothly into your business operations. Choosing the Right Messaging Platform : The first step in implementing secure chat in the hospitality sector is selecting the right messaging platform . Look for platforms that offer a range of communication tools, from traditional SMS and text messages to modern features like voice calls and voice messages . Ensure that the platform is compatible with various devices, including Mac , to accommodate the diverse technology used by staff and guests. Ensuring Data Security and Protection from Hackers : When dealing with sensitive user data , it's crucial to choose a secure chat solution that offers robust protection against cyber threats. Opt for platforms that provide end-to-end encryption to safeguard communications from being intercepted by hackers . This encryption should extend to all forms of communication, including secret chats , ensuring that even the most confidential interactions remain protected. Integrating with Existing Systems and Social Media : To maximize efficiency and user convenience, integrate the secure chat platform with your existing operational systems. This integration should also extend to social media platforms, allowing for seamless and secure communication with guests. By doing so, you can leverage the popularity of social media while ensuring that all interactions remain encrypted and protected. Training Staff and Promoting Secure Communication Practices: Implementing secure chat is not just about technology; it’s also about training your staff to use these tools effectively. Provide training sessions that cover the basics of secure communication , focusing on the importance of protecting user data and avoiding unencrypted messages. Encourage staff to use secure chat for all internal and guest communications, reinforcing the habit of safeguarding information at all times. Wrapping Up In conclusion, secure chat is not just a technology trend; it's a crucial pillar for success in today's hospitality industry. It represents the most secure messaging app approach to handling sensitive information, be it in a bustling kitchen or at the front desk of a luxury hotel. With advanced features like end-to-end encryption protocols and authentication methods, these apps ensure that every piece of data, from a guest's IP address to their dietary preferences, is handled with the utmost confidentiality. Secure chat is a safeguard against legal liabilities, a bridge for swift crisis management, and a facilitator of enhanced guest experiences. It's about recognizing that the hospitality sector, now more than ever, operates in a digital sphere where secure communication is as important as exceptional service. From WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger to specialized apps like Wire , the best encrypted messaging apps offer diverse functionalities. They cater to the dynamic needs of hospitality operations, ensuring that every message, file, or screenshot shared maintains its integrity. With robust encryption keys and secure source code , these apps are setting new standards in protecting metadata and personal details. Ultimately, secure chat apps are redefining how the hospitality industry operates, turning potential vulnerabilities into strengths. They empower teams to perform at their best, making them an indispensable asset in any hospitality setting, striving to deliver the best secure , efficient, and memorable service to its guests.

Integration : Make sure the team chat solution integrates with other tools and systems like CRM, accounting software, or automation APIs such as Zapier . Security: Ensure that the tool complies with industry security standards and compliance. Training Employees Conduct training sessions to teach employees how to use channels effectively, share knowledge, document decisions, and collaborate. Have them complete hands-on activities that give them confidence in using the chat tool. Leadership Buy-In Get leadership and management actively using team chat to model the desired practices. They should participate daily and encourage adoption. Define Etiquette and Recognize Success Define team chat etiquette around communicating transparently while being respectful. Set expectations for response times, especially for those working floors or waitstaff. Recognize teams and employees who collaborate exceptionally well on team chat . Have them share best practices.

We’ve talked about the best loan options , potential food delivery service partners , restaurant safety protocols and guidelines - and today we’ll touch on restaurant sanitization and the best options for sanitizer solution for restaurants. In a recent study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, the coronavirus has been found to survive on non-porous surfaces like plastic, and stainless steel for up to 72 hours . This finding makes it absolutely critical that all contact surfaces in a restaurant be properly sanitized, in order to kill off pathogens and limit transmission during food processing and serving. Also, according to the FDA ’s Food Code , contaminated equipment in food service is one of the major risk factors that contribute to foodborne illness . Sanitizing Process It’s important to note that there is a proper multi-step process to best sanitize dishes and equipment in commercial kitchen . The five-step process is as follows: Pre-clean Scrape off all particles (or food “soil”) from the surface of your tools and food-processing equipment . Oils or grease can actually prevent sanitizers from effectively cleaning your equipment . Wash Soak and wash in the first compartment of your restaurant sink for at least 30 seconds. Water must be at least at least 171˚F (77˚C), or you can run items through a high-temperature dishwasher. Rinse Move equipment to the second compartment of your sink and rinse them off with clean, warm water. If using the dipping method, make sure to replace the water often. Sanitize Clean with a combination of water and chemical sanitizer solution for restaurants. This process will help kill off up to 99% of all pathogens . Dry Let your equipment and tools air-dry . Do not pat or wipe dry as the cleaning aids you will use may transfer pathogens once again if not sanitized properly. Types of Sanitizers There are many different kinds of surface sanitizer solutions for restaurants out there - and yes, not all of them are created equal. Some restaurant sanitizing solutions or hand sanitizers cannot be used on food-contact surfaces like countertops or dispensers because they are too corrosive, too toxic, or simply too expensive for regular use. Here’s a breakdown of the three most common sanitizing chemicals used in restaurants, and some of the pros and cons for each . CHEMICAL SANITIZERS ADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGES Chlorine Effective against a wide variety of microorganisms Non-staining Relatively inexpensive Can irritate skin Has a strong odor Effectiveness decreases with higher PH of cleaning solution Iodine Non-corrosive and non-irritating to skin Longer shelf life Not affected by water hardness Relatively costly May stain some surfaces Less effective against bacteria (compared to chlorine) Quaternary Ammonium Very stable, little loss of efficacy over use No odor or taste residue Non-corrosive and non-toxic Long shelf life Not compatible with many detergents Not as effective against bacteriophages Relatively expensive So how do you choose which sanitizer solution for restaurants is the best one for you according to the food safety ? Check which restaurant sanitizing solutions are allowed by your local regulatory authority Contact suppliers and see which is the most readily available to you Do your costing to determine which is more practical for your budget in the long run Determine your restaurant’s specific needs and match to the most appropriate sanitizer TAGS Franchise HR tech Articles Camille Ranullo Part-time content marketing writer at Workstream, full-time mom and chef wannabe.

    "status": "success",
    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 10/25/23 Why Are Automated Messages Important? Share this article Have you ever stopped to consider the silent yet relentless worker that is automated messages ? Imagine it as a tireless mailman, delivering information at lightning speed, always on time and never missing an address. This digital dynamo works around the clock so businesses don't have to. In today's fast-paced world where immediate responses are not just appreciated but expected, automated messaging plays a vital role in keeping us connected. It's like having a personal digital assistant available to take action at any moment. The upcoming discussion will pull back the curtain on this unsung hero of customer communication and marketing efforts. We'll delve into its intricate workings and show how they can be harnessed for maximum business impact - from engaging customers with personalized content, enhancing customer support surveys, notifying about important appointment reminders , to even integrating social media channels for wider reach. SMS automation when done correctly a huge game changer. Understanding Automated Messages If you've ever received a text notification for an appointment, or a payment confirmation from your bank, then you're already familiar with automated messages. Essentially, these are pre-written texts that businesses send out automatically based on specific triggers or events set up in the workflows . These workflows connect the data-base of phone numbers to the workflow trigger and allow for a smooth, automated process. Defining Automated Messages The beauty of automated messages , lies in their simplicity and efficiency. Businesses use them to maintain constant communication with customers without the need for human intervention at every step. This doesn't just save time - it ensures important information gets relayed promptly. A classic example of automatic text messages is when businesses send automatic texts confirming bookings or purchases made by customers online. It’s instant reassurance for the customer that their transaction has been successful. Implementing Automated Messages for Enhanced Marketing Campaigns Automated messages are not just about sending out a text blast. They need to be carefully curated with automated workflows and some attention to detail. Once that’s figured out you start to see the benefits. Marketing teams try their best to use personalized messages and follow-up logic that keeps the conversation going but can be difficult when mass texting . Leveraging Automated Messages for Improved Customer Support Customer service is a crucial aspect of any business, and automated messages have become an essential tool in enhancing it. They can increase efficiency, lead to higher customer satisfaction rates, and help in conducting support surveys . The beauty of automated messaging lies not only in its convenience but also the potential for personalization. A well-crafted message can make customers feel valued while providing necessary information or assistance. Say you run a tech company that often gets asked the same question: \"How do I reset my password?\" Instead of having your support team answer this repeatedly, an automatic text could give immediate help to your customers. This lets your team focus on more complex queries. Apart from resolving common questions quickly, these messages work as effective payment reminders too. For instance, if a customer's subscription is about to end or their bill due date is near; sending them an automated reminder will prompt action without seeming pushy. Moreover, companies with large contact lists find it easier to manage communications through bulk texting rather than individual emails or calls. In essence, using such technology enhances both speed and quality - two critical elements that define excellent customer service. Choosing the Right Platform for Automated Messaging Selecting the right platform is crucial when setting up automated messaging systems. You'll want one that lets you send texts, receive text messages, and trigger pre-written messages based on specific events or customer behaviors. A well-chosen platform can also help manage your contact list , ensuring all recipients have opted into receiving your communications. Ensuring that only those who have opted in to your communications are reached, you can create a meaningful dialogue with interested customers. Personalizing Automated Messages with Custom Fields Incorporating custom fields into your message content adds a personal touch that enhances customer experience significantly. By tailoring messages according to recipient-specific data like names or past purchase history - gathered from sources such as opt-in campaigns - businesses can establish more meaningful connections with their audience. To make this happen though, it's important we pick platforms capable of integrating these custom fields into our SMS templates seamlessly. That way we can ensure every message feels unique and relevant — because no one likes feeling like they’re just another number on a company’s contact list . Best Practices in Deploying Automated Messages The effectiveness of your automated messages hinges on two key factors: timing and frequency. Striking the right balance can ensure you reach leads when they're most receptive, without overwhelming them. Timing and Frequency of Automated Messages Your message's impact depends largely on when it hits the inbox. Let's consider a business that operates during regular opening hours - their best bet would be to send automated texts just before or after these hours. This way, recipients are likely free to engage with the content. Finding an optimal sending schedule requires some trial-and-error, though there are tools available to help make this task easier by analyzing response rates at different times throughout the day. These findings can be used to refine your communication approach for the best results. In terms of frequency, it’s essential not to overwhelm your contact list with too many messages. One approach is creating a drip campaign where messages are automatically triggered based on certain actions taken by customers or time intervals between sends. You might want to ask yourself if every single text adds value? If not, trim down and focus more on quality than quantity. Remember – people tend to respond better when they don’t feel bombarded. Remember also that while automation helps save time and maintain consistency in communication efforts; human touch should never be completely removed from customer interactions. Remember also that while automation helps save time and maintain consistency in communication efforts; human touch should never be completely removed from customer interactions. The Intersection of Social Media and Automated Messages There's an exciting synergy between social media platforms and automated messaging that businesses can leverage. This integration allows for a broader reach, facilitating seamless communication with customers. In the era where everyone is digitally connected, combining social media channels like Facebook or Instagram with automated messages opens up new possibilities. Businesses can automatically send messages to followers who interact on their posts, boosting engagement rates significantly. This combination also provides value in terms of customer service. When customers raise queries through social media comments or direct messages, businesses can swiftly respond using automated texts while ensuring personalized interaction. Social listening tools come into play here too; they monitor mentions across various networks and alert companies when it’s time to engage—making sure no conversation goes unnoticed. Apart from maintaining relationships, this strategy enhances promotional efforts as well. Announcing discounts or new product launches becomes more impactful when done simultaneously over multiple mediums—the classic one-two punch. How does it work? You start by syncing your contact list from your preferred platform (like Twitter) to your message service provider. Create templates for different types of interactions - maybe a thank you note for follows/likes/shares or informational content addressing frequently asked questions. Your system then monitors activity and triggers appropriate responses based on predefined rules—giving rise to meaningful conversations without additional manual effort. Using Automated Messages for Net Promoter Score Surveys The Net Promoter Score (NPS) , a widely used benchmark of customer loyalty, can provide crucial insights into your business's performance. Sending automated text messages requesting NPS surveys has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency. When the trigger is based on specific events such as completed transactions or milestones, these requests feel less intrusive and more relevant to the customer. This strategy helps businesses get solicited reviews without making their customers feel bombarded with unnecessary communication. This approach also benefits those who are usually reluctant to leave feedback because they believe it will take too much time or effort. By simplifying the process through automation, you encourage customers' participation and increase response rates significantly. Besides being practical and efficient, sending out SMS invitations for NPS surveys using automated texts demonstrates that you value your customers' opinions which further enhances brand loyalty. FAQs in Relation to Automated Messages What is a good auto-reply text message? A solid auto-reply text provides immediate acknowledgment, explains when the sender can expect a response, and offers an alternative contact if urgent. How do I set up automated messages? To get started with automated messages, choose a platform like Twilio or SimpleTexting. Then craft your content, schedule dispatch times, and define triggers. Is there such a thing as automated text messages ? Absolutely. Automated texts are pre-written responses sent out based on certain actions or triggers - they're key in marketing and customer service. How do automatic messages work? Automatic messages work through systems that send predefined texts based on specific events or user behaviors. It's about setting conditions for each message to be dispatched. Conclusion Stepping into the world of automated messages , we've seen how they can revolutionize business operations. They are like your personal digital mailman, delivering timely and relevant content to customers. We've dug deep into their role in marketing strategies, realizing that well-crafted automated texts can significantly boost customer engagement . Diving further, we saw how they enhance customer service by automating certain aspects for increased efficiency and satisfaction. We learned the mechanics behind setting them up - choosing the right platform, using custom fields for a personalized touch.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 10/23/23 The importance of platform security Share this article Understanding the Concept of Platform Security Platform security is a cornerstone in our increasingly digital world. Platform security encompasses measures taken to protect an entire computing platform from bad actors and other threats. VMWare, for instance, defines it as safeguarding the system's hardware, operating systems , software network layers - essentially every aspect that forms part of your tech infrastructure. The concept goes beyond traditional firewalls or endpoint protection methods. It focuses on securing the service edge by creating a robust framework encompassing everything from firmware updates to intrusion prevention mechanisms. This approach not only helps prevent data breaches but also ensures secure design practices throughout the lifecycle of a device or application. The Role of Platform Security in Digital Transformation In today's hyper-connected era where 73% of enterprises use two or more public clouds (as per RightScale’s 2023 State Of The Cloud Report), platform security becomes even more crucial during digital transformation initiatives. A sound understanding and implementation can be game-changing for businesses trying to balance innovation with risk management. After all, if you're looking at embracing technology holistically through platforms based on cloud services or IoT devices for instance – they need trusted boot firmware updates and layered security approaches among other considerations. The Architecture and Elements of Platform Security A secure platform requires a multi-faceted approach, with hardware forming the foundation. One such layer is the hardware, which forms the bedrock of any secure platform. Hardware Considerations for Secure Platforms In designing secure platforms, considering security capabilities at the hardware level becomes essential. This ensures that bad actors find no room to wiggle into your system through physical vulnerabilities . A solid starting point involves implementing trusted boot firmware updates to safeguard against malicious code during system startup. This technique verifies each piece of software from the moment you power on your device until your operating system loads fully. A neat example can be found in Apple devices running iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS - all designed with security capabilities right into their silicon. Beyond these initial steps lies an entire computing platform 's protection strategy: ensuring endpoint detection and intrusion prevention systems are up-to-date and correctly configured; setting up next-generation firewalls beyond traditional ones; establishing policy management processes that adapt to changing threat landscapes—just some examples among many more needed measures. The choice between bundled/unified security software versus portfolio-based platforms often depends on specific use-cases and requirements—an intricate decision-making process involving numerous factors like scalability needs or budget constraints. Apple’s approach towards platform security, for instance, leans towards unified solutions across its various devices. The Benefits and Drawbacks to Platform Security Platform security is like a fortress protecting your digital assets. But just as fortresses had their advantages and disadvantages in historical battles, so does platform security in the digital realm. Benefits of Platform Security A major benefit of platform security is its comprehensive nature. It's not just about app security or data protection ; it encompasses everything from hardware platforms to operating systems . This all-in-one approach simplifies management and provides more consistent defense against bad actors. An effective platform security solution offers robust intrusion prevention mechanisms, coupled with an integrated threat intelligence system for timely response to emerging threats. It also employs firmware updates regularly to fix any identified vulnerabilities , making sure the entire computing platform remains secure. Drawbacks of Platform Security No system is perfect though, including platform security solutions . One potential challenge lies in their complexity: managing multiple layers of defenses can be daunting without proper training or tools at hand. Some might argue that such complexities make the whole setup vulnerable if mishandled. Certain traditional firewalls may not work effectively within a bundled/unified software network framework leading some organizations towards next-generation firewall options instead. To sum up, while embracing platform-based defenses brings many benefits like unified control over different elements under one umbrella, you need expertise on board too because getting things wrong could potentially leave your entire virtual castle exposed. Apple's Approach to Cyber Security Apple is a game-changer in the cyber security /platform security world. The company uses silicon-based security measures , integrating them right into the entire computing platform of its devices. This isn't just about ensuring that your iPhone stays safe from bad actors. Building trust and providing a sense of security are essential for users to feel comfortable using their devices on a daily basis. Encryption Features in Apple Devices A significant part of this approach involves encryption features built directly into iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS systems. They safeguard user data like Fort Knox. Even if your device falls prey to theft or loss, these features enable remote wipe - pretty neat huh? In addition to keeping personal data under lock and key on the hardware platform itself, this approach also covers app security and service edge considerations for all software network interactions too. iCloud services are secured by two-factor authentication which ensures only you can access your stuff. Siri voice recognition learns from you but keeps all information anonymized so she doesn’t know who’s asking her what. The App Store carefully reviews each application before allowing it onto the platform - no uninvited guests here. All these measures together make up an integrated threat intelligence system that continuously monitors for any potential threats. So whether it's trying out new apps or storing sensitive files on iCloud – with Apple at helm; there is little need to worry about environment security as well as unified (or should we say bundled/unified?) software protection aspects either. Finally worth noting is that Apple's devices have the trusted boot firmware update , a unique feature which ensures that only trusted software gets loaded during startup. This not only makes your entire platform less vulnerable but also gives you peace of mind every time you hit the power button. Key Takeaway: Apple's shaking things up in platform security, embedding silicon-based measures right into their devices to build trust and guarantee safe everyday use. Their strategy includes encryption features that protect user data across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS systems—yes, even remote wipe is an option. The safety net stretches further to cover app security and network interactions with services like iCloud — all secured by two-factor authentication . Common Uses of Platform Security The use of platform security is no longer a luxury but rather a necessity. Businesses are recognizing the need to secure their digital transformation efforts and app security plays an integral part in this. Platform security fits into the overall cybersecurity realm as it helps protect sensitive data, maintain user trust, and avoid financial loss due to cyberattacks . In terms of data protection , many companies utilize trusted boot firmware updates as part of their platform's hardware setup. This ensures that the entire computing platform is secured from malicious threats at startup. A more comprehensive approach involves integrating threat intelligence into your security model which can proactively identify potential vulnerabilities before they become significant issues. By doing so, you’re not just responding to incidents after they occur but actively preventing them from happening in the first place. Security Orchestration Across Various Platforms To handle multiple security measures across various platforms effectively, businesses often turn towards using bundled/unified security software or portfolio-based platforms for better manageability and efficiency. This holistic view on endpoint detection enables teams to have an application awareness about possible intrusions and quickly fix these issues while minimizing any negative impact on operations. Endpoint Protection For IoT Devices The surge in IoT devices has opened up new possibilities for bad actors trying to exploit weak points within networked systems. An effective solution here includes implementing next-generation firewalls designed with integrated threat intelligence capabilities that surpass traditional firewall defenses by incorporating real-time analytics regarding ongoing attacks around the world. In addition, bundled/unified security solutions provide comprehensive protection against such threats through a layered defense strategy encompassing the entire platform, including software network and hardware elements. Platform security has a broad range of uses across industries. Its role in ensuring secure design is pivotal to business operations as well as customer trust. In this article, you can discover ways businesses are implementing to make their platforms more secure. Key Takeaway: Platform security is crucial, not a luxury. It protects sensitive data and maintains trust while preventing financial losses from cyberattacks . Trusted boot firmware updates secure the computing platform at startup, and integrating threat intelligence helps identify vulnerabilities early on. Unified security software simplifies managing various platforms' safety measures while endpoint protection secures IoT devices with next-gen firewalls and comprehensive defense strategies. The Future of Platform Security With the digital transformation wave sweeping across industries, platform security is a critical consideration. But let's face it; today's security platforms are much more than just traditional firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. To stay ahead of the curve, organizations must take a proactive stance to security by implementing next-gen firewalls and integrating threat intelligence . This means adopting next-generation firewall technologies and integrating threat intelligence into their environment for real-time response. Data security services coincide with platform security when it comes to the future of the software. Cloud-based or on-site data should be viewed monetarily and as an asset. If data is breeched that can be a drastic blow to any business. Role of Automation and AI in Platform Security As we step further into the future, automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are poised to redefine platform security. From detecting anomalies in network traffic patterns to predicting potential threats based on historical data, these technologies promise unprecedented levels of protection. IBM’s research , for instance, reveals that AI can help identify cyberattacks up to 60 times faster than human analysts could manage alone. That's like having your own team of superhuman defenders. Firmware updates also play a vital role here as they patch vulnerabilities before bad actors can exploit them - think about it as getting regular health check-ups but for your computing platform . It makes sure everything runs smoothly without any nasty surprises waiting around the corner. Bundled/unified software: Bundling multiple layers of defenses ensures robust endpoint detection against emerging threats. Data protection : Implementing policies around data access rights prevents unauthorized use or leaks from inside the organization itself – because sometimes danger comes from within. User-awareness programs: Regular training sessions keep employees updated on best practices while reinforcing safe behaviors online – remember folks; knowledge is power.

The Golden State's minimum hourly rate will jump from $15.50 to $16.00 starting January 1st, 2024 according to the state's Department of Finance Director Joe Stephenshaw (View our California hourly wage index for more information ). The 50 cent increase was announced on July 31st, 2023 and will help hourly workers better weather the high cost of living in California. The impact on wages won't be limited to your favorite burger joints either; it’s going across the board from Los Angeles diners right through San Francisco coffee shops ( Federal Minimum Wage Information ). No matter how sizzling the grills get or how busy the lunch rush is, this hike ensures that every minute spent flipping burgers or making coffees counts even more towards achieving financial stability. On top of the wage changes that are surely happening, a new deal between labor and industry would potentially bump that $15.50 per hour all the way up to $20.00 per hour. This mandatory wage bump would impact all fast food restaurants in California that are part of a chain with at least 60 locations across the nation. This bill must be pending and comes down to the state legislature but hourly workers across the state are surely hopeful for the change. Impact On The Broader Fast-Food Industry Now here's some food for thought: what does this mean for those beyond individual workers? Well, small businesses may need to adjust their budgets while big corporations could see an uptick in labor costs - but hey, happy staff often equals happier customers. This wage boost isn’t just staying within state lines either as other states are likely watching closely too. Will they follow suit with similar changes or will they continue down their own wage path? Impact on Small Businesses and Preparations for Wage Increases Small businesses are typically the most vulnerable to any increase in minimum wage. Unlike large corporations, they may not have a cushion to soften the financial impact of higher labor costs. No Relief or Grace Period for Small Businesses The upcoming hike in California's minimum wage offers no grace period for small businesses. This means there's little time to adjust budgets and strategies. As daunting as this might sound, don't panic. With careful planning and some smart moves, you can prepare your business to weather these changes. An essential first step is reviewing your budget and financial records carefully. It sounds basic but knowing where every dollar goes will help you find areas where savings can be made without compromising quality or service levels. A tip from our firsthand experience: consider cross-training employees so they're equipped with multiple skills. This could let them handle more tasks efficiently - a move that ultimately saves money. You might also want to think about automation wherever possible. Streamlining processes using technology could save valuable man-hours which translates into dollars saved in wages paid out. By the way, Workstream helps alleviate a lot of this automation stress. \"If I had one piece of advice for fellow small business owners,\" says Jim Collins, who runs a bakery chain across San Francisco \"it would be this: stay informed about changing regulations.\" In conclusion, while increased wages do pose challenges especially if you run a small venture; staying informed and proactive planning can turn it around. Comparing California's Minimum Wage to Other States Attempting to make it on fifty thousand dollars annually in California can be a daunting task. With the cost of living and taxes sky-high compared to other states, your dollar just doesn't stretch as far. Our hourly wage index can help break down wage information in all states but for this exersise let's focus on the great state of South Carolina . But let's take this into perspective. In South Carolina, the minimum wage is identical to the federal rate of $7.25 per hour - a figure that may seem meagre in comparison with California's rate but which must be taken into account when considering our state’s notoriously expensive cost of living. That sounds low when stacked against California's hefty hourly rate but remember - it’s all relative. The real bite comes from our state’s infamous cost of living which is one of the highest in America. In Los Angeles for example, that same wage would need to be significantly higher just for workers to have comparable purchasing power. This stark difference between wages and costs makes earning a 'living wage' tough even with our progressive laws leading us towards higher minimums. High Cost of Living in California In cities like San Francisco or Los Angeles, expenses are astronomical. Everything from rent prices to groceries takes more out of your paycheck than almost anywhere else in the U.S., despite having some local ordinances pushing wages above statewide levels. Surely enough, though every Californian dreams about sun-soaked beaches and perfect weather 365 days a year - these perks come at quite a price. But hey, who said anything about paradise being cheap? Future Predictions for Minimum Wage in California The future of minimum wage in the Golden State has been a hot topic, especially considering inflation and other economic factors. The Director's role is crucial as they are tasked with adjusting wages based on these elements. Inflation plays an essential part here because it directly impacts purchasing power. If prices rise faster than wages, workers find it harder to make ends meet despite wage increases. So, we could expect more adjustments to the state's minimum wage if inflation continues its upward trend. This approach makes sense when you think about it like this: You wouldn't keep using your old umbrella during a rainstorm if it had holes in it and was no longer keeping you dry - you'd get a new one. If the present minimum wage doesn't suffice in light of increasing expenses, then a boost is required. Predicting exact numbers can be challenging though; just like trying to guess what color shirt your neighbor will wear tomorrow (good luck with that.). But looking at trends can give us some idea. For example, South Carolina recently announced a deal regarding their own minimum annual salary increase – something that might hint towards similar moves elsewhere too. If we look back over time, there have been consistent increments since 2007 where California’s Department raised the hourly rate from $8 per hour up till now at $15 per hour or even higher for local ordinances. Given such history, one thing seems certain: With ever-changing economic conditions including consumer price indices factored into calculations - don’t bet against another bump soon. Conclusion We've explored the state, federal, and local laws that dictate these rates. Through our journey, we saw how inflation plays a crucial role in setting wages. The differences between local ordinances across cities became apparent too. We peered into fast food workers' upcoming pay raises and pondered over the challenges small businesses face due to this increase. Yet amidst it all, they remain resilient by preparing well ahead of time. A broader perspective revealed California's higher-than-average wage compared with other states; yet the high cost of living remains an uphill battle for many earning at or near minimum wage levels. In looking forward, let’s not forget predictions indicate further increases based on economic factors like inflation.
