This is why so many use discounts, promos and coupons to draw customers in with bargains. But are coupons genuinely effective in the QSR space? You’re about to find out. In this blog post, we’ll be diving into coupons as a marketing strategy, which franchises are using them, and some of the benefits and disadvantages to using coupons as a QSR. Photo by Erik Mclean on Unsplash Which QSR franchises are currently using coupons? If you’re thinking to yourself, “Coupons are old school. Who clips them anymore?” You’re slightly right—and you’ll want to keep reading. Most coupons today are distributed digitally through branded apps. McDonald’s The McDonald’s app allows customers to access digital coupons and get discounts. McDonald’s started a free fry campaign to incentivize their customers to download their app. The free fry campaign involved McDonald’s customers getting free fries with any purchase over $1, but only if they had the app. This fueled a surge in downloads, which allowed McDonald’s to keep offering deals and drawing customers in via coupons on their app. Part of McDonald’s business strategy to compete with Starbucks , which has long been offering in-app loyalty cards and discounts and receiving a third of their orders via the mobile app, is increasing app users and usage. McDonald’s use of discounts has helped them outperform competitors by up to 70 basis points during difficult quarters, getting customers to order more when they come in. Photo by William Enrico Jr Quijano on Unsplash Starbucks Photo by Douglas Bagg on Unsplash Starbucks wanted a better way to attract younger people, which drove them to offer coupons and loyalty cards in their mobile app. Starbucks has the most regularly used loyalty rewards app , demonstrating that coupons can be used effectively. Starbucks incentivizes their customers to use their app by offering free in-store refills to those who have the app. Through their app, they also offer: Birthday rewards A star system that gives you two stars per dollar you spend ‘Challenges’ every month that grant you extra stars (like ordering any macchiato drink) Member offers and discounts The Starbucks app goes above and beyond to make its users feel like they are playing a game; the more you visit Starbucks, the more points you get. Starbucks members usually spend more than other customers, representing 39% of the chain’s sales . What are the benefits of using coupons as a QSR? Coupons fulfill an ‘ever-growing need for savings, caused by global economic turmoil.’ Now that we have looked at some of the successful uses of coupons within top QSRs, let’s talk about the benefits of using coupons. Coupons make launching new menus easier If you have an app for your restaurant, send your customers alerts to let them know when you launch a new menu item. Offering promotional discounts will make consumers more inclined to try something new (and maybe again in the future). Coupons incentivize sales As we saw with the monthly challenges used by the Starbucks app, you can use coupons to make dining at your restaurant feel more interactive. As the coupon experts at DealA explain, “When customers have a coupon with an expiration date, they feel a sense of urgency to use it before it runs out, or run the risk of experiencing ‘anticipatory regret.’ Coupons with expiry dates can not only increase customer conversions but also help secure a customer purchase.” Coupons can be used to boost sales on slower days If your QSR has identifiable slow days, use coupons to bring in more custom on those days. Say sales figures are higher on weekends and slower on Tuesdays or Thursdays, you may want to introduce offers limited to those days. The same applies to slow parts of the day, such as lunch or breakfast. Photo by Marcel Heil on Unsplash What are the disadvantages of using coupons as a QSR? There are some disadvantages to using coupons, and understanding the shortcomings of coupons can help you use them more effectively. Preparation is necessary If you’re offering a massive deal in your restaurant, you need to be sure that you have the staff and stock to cover a surge in customers. If you don’t adequately prepare for a coupon event, new customers could have a poor impression of your brand (and never return). Customers may not spend more A good portion of customers that use coupons only use them to get a cheap meal or free item. They may not spend more than necessary to redeem the coupon and may not respond to upselling. (In fact, they may have ordered the same thing with or without the coupon, so at that point, you’re just handing out a discount.) Summary Coupons work—but they may not always be profitable for your restaurant. Luckily, if you want to give coupons a go, you don’t have to indefinitely commit to them. If you feel like it may generate more customers for you, test into it. Run a promo or two and measure the results. If it works, try more. If it doesn’t work, make adjustments before fully calling it quits. After all, U.S. consumers love a good coupon.

However, hiring managers often overlook the potential of reaching out to passive job seekers. Many passive job candidates are happily employed. Why would they want to make a career change right now? Even though trying to recruit passive candidates may seem like a waste of time, the opposite is actually true. Passive job seekers can be some of the best candidates for your brand because they are more likely to be good employees by virtue of the fact that they’re currently employed. The tricky part is knowing how to best attract passive job seekers and get them interested in working for your store. In today’s post, we discuss five strategies you can use to attract those seemingly elusive passive job seekers. 1. Use social media Restaurants are increasingly turning to social media platforms to attract passive job seekers. That’s because these platforms allow you to reach large audiences in efficient ways. In fact, Chipotle recently used TikTok to attract passive candidates—and it paid off. You can use Twitter's advanced search functionality to scan user profiles for relevant keywords and hashtags. For example, if you're hiring for a district manager (DM) position, you can search Twitter for specific QSR management keywords within your brand’s targeted region. These search results can uncover general managers (GMs) and DMs who share branded content from their current employer on Twitter. Plus, this Twitter activity provides evidence that they're engaged and enthusiastic about their career, which bodes well for their candidacy with your brand. Facebook is another valuable social media platform you can use to find passive job seekers. You can use Facebook’s advanced targeting capabilities to promote career opportunity content to relevant crew member audiences. Facebook provides a wide range of targeting options for this content including geographic, sociographic and interest targeting. Plus, potential crew members don’t usually receive Facebook content from recruiters, so they may be more likely to respond because of the novelty aspect of the engagement. In addition to TikTok, Twitter and Facebook, you should also be using other social media platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram and LinkedIn (especially for vice president of operations and manager positions). As a hiring manager, you can use these platforms uniquely to reach passive job seekers. You can even get creative and send sponsored Snapchats or Instagram stories that let passive candidates know about the amazing opportunities available. 2. Adopt automation into your hiring process Ground-breaking automated hiring technology has been a game-changer for QSR recruiting. Hiring managers can now use artificial intelligence (AI) to more efficiently find passive job seekers as compared with using manual methods. In many cases, digital platforms use algorithms to predict the future success of hires better than humans. AI automatically scans the internet to harvest valuable data on passive candidates including resume information and social media activity. Based on this data, automated hiring platforms can predict which job seekers are most likely to be open to switching jobs, allowing you to place a higher priority on those candidates. 3. Create a strong referral program Current employees can be your best source of future talent. Most of your employees have their own personal networks in the community. These networks often have passive job seekers who would be a great match for open roles at your restaurants. While passive job seekers might be reluctant to respond to recruiters, they are far more likely to respond to opportunities they hear about from a friend or family member. Put a robust referral program into place that adequately incentivizes current employees to help recruit their friends and family members. Doing so will enable you to source more passive and better candidates because of their connection to current employees. 4. Maximize job boards Many active job seekers use job boards such as Indeed and Monster.com to find their next career opportunity. In fact, our customers here at Workstream are able to post jobs to 25,000 job boards with a single click. While job boards are great for connecting with active job seekers, many QSRs don’t realize their potential use for passive job seekers as well. The reason is that candidates upload their resumes to job boards during their active search, but those resumes are oftentimes retained in their job board profiles long after they’ve accepted new jobs. This gives savvy hiring managers a great way to tap into passive job candidate pools. You can do this by searching these job boards based on many different data points such as industry, experience, skills and education level. When viable passive candidates show up in these search results, you can reach out to them and turn them into active candidates for your restaurant. 5. Emphasize your culture and ability to develop talent Since passive job seekers aren’t looking for a new job, simply telling them about the roles and responsibilities of the position is not an effective strategy. You must emphasize their brand’s culture and ability to develop talent . If you’re serious about engaging passive candidates, make it clear why your restaurant’s culture is unique and how it could positively impact their life. In fact, 87% of millennials say career development is important, and approximately 80% want a culture fit with company’s before they further consider a potential job. To motivate a passive job seeker to leave their current job, you need to help them buy into the idea that a new culture can better develop their career. If a passive candidate doesn’t think that your culture is significantly better than their current employer’s culture, they are less likely to engage with your outreach. At Workstream, we provide QSRs with digital hiring solutions that help them consistently source passive job seekers for their restaurants. Our next-generation hiring platform automates the hiring process, which allows GMs and QSR leaders to focus on growing their business and securing their pipelines of future talent.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter 04/18/22 Elevate your reputation by responding to negative reviews Share this article More and more QSR employees are posting negative reviews about their employers online. For VPs of Operations and HR Managers, monitoring and responding to these negative employee reviews is more important than ever before. Responding to a negative review from a current or former employee, however, is not always easy. It’s natural for emotions to heighten when you receive a negative review from a former employee. Despite how difficult those negative reviews may be to read, it’s critical that you put best practices in place for responding to negative reviews. Why? Because, according to a Glassdoor survey , 62% of job seekers say their perception of a company improves after seeing an employer respond to a review. So, let’s take a closer look at how you can build an effective response strategy for negative employee reviews. How to build a response strategy for negative employee reviews When it comes time to respond to negative employee reviews , it’s vital that you have an effective strategy in place to maintain a positive reputation for your restaurant. Here are the core elements you need to incorporate: Differentiate between current and former employees The manner in which you approach a negative review should be different depending on whether the review came from a former or current employee. If you suspect that a review came from a current employee, address the concern with your team and work toward finding an immediate resolution to the complaint. In order to maintain a positive culture , you’ll want to make sure your employee feels heard and valued. Respond thoughtfully and in a timely manner You should respond to negative employee reviews promptly. If too much time elapses, you may unintentionally be giving the impression to your local community that your restaurant doesn’t care. On the flip side of that,  it’s important to not respond to negative reviews as soon as you receive them, especially if you’re experiencing a strong emotional response. Knee-jerk, heated responses will only make the negative review that much worse for your store. It’s best to regularly monitor all employee reviews using automated alerts and then carefully plan a prompt and professional response to post one or two days after the negative review is received. Have one of your leaders write the response Designate a leader on your team (a GM or HR manager) to respond to employee reviews. This is a powerful way to signal that your restaurant takes employee feedback seriously. Each response should be signed with the name and title of the leader who wrote it because it humanizes the response—and your company’s leadership. Investigate any specific claims made by an employee If a negative review mentions a specific event or issue that allegedly occurred, it’s imperative that you investigate each claim by reviewing any available resources in order to determine if the allegation is in fact true. In cases where you determine that there is insufficient evidence to support the allegations, ask for more information. For any allegations of a legal nature, immediately refer the complaint to the legal counsel for your brand before responding. Be thorough and specific in your response It’s important to be thorough in your response and address every issue that the reviewer mentions. If you only respond to part of their issue, it gives the appearance that you’re avoiding responsibility. Whatever you do, don’t post generic, canned responses to negative reviews because this will make your public perception worse than not responding at all. By writing specific and individualized responses, you show employees and readers that your brand is sincere. Sincerity increases the chances of reconciling with the employee and speaks volumes to the public about the integrity of your restaurant. Always be respectful and professional When it comes to responding to negative reviews, objectivity is the name of the game. No matter how offensive and untrue a negative review is, you should remain professional and respectful in your responses at all times. Companies that are disrespectful or combative in their responses only further taint the public’s perception of them. Maintain a culture of gratitude It may seem counterintuitive and even unfair but saying “thank you” for a negative review goes a long way towards improving your brand’s perception. Companies that welcome feedback are more respected by their employees and held in higher regard by customers. In particular, former employees who feel like the restaurant didn’t care about them will appreciate that you’re making the effort to reconcile. Additionally, job candidates who are reading the reviews will respect your humility and openness to criticism. Communicate your plan of action When it comes to responding to negative reviews, words aren’t enough. You must also take action when it’s appropriate. As part of your response, you should detail the steps you’re taking to address the issue. By taking corrective action, you show employees and customers that your business is transparent and accountable.

Such an unprecedented occurrence has given way to anxiety, as people are scrambling to find ways to cope with the sudden shift in their lifestyles. The effects of the coronavirus pandemic have also put senior citizens in the at-risk category, giving rise to panic and fear. In such times, it becomes the responsibility of the community to ensure that proper lines of communication are maintained at all times. While we leave the major breakthroughs to the experts, our job as a community is to radiate positivity, empathy, and optimism. Key Channels of Communication Social Media: As family members of the seniors residing at assisted living facilities are coping with restrictions too, this is the best time to make use of social media to maintain a semblance of normalcy. Upload regular videos that showcase meal times, social-distance activities, and how residents are making the best use of their time while remaining indoors. Videos always carry a personal touch, and will certainly lift the spirits of the seniors’ loved ones and help them stay hopeful and calm. Blog: Assisted living centers can also publish regular blog posts about the COVID-19 situation and the various changes that it has brought about. These articles can range from efforts made by the management to quell fear and curb the spread of the virus, to personal stories shared by residents regarding their take on the global pandemic. Residents can also give insights into their experience at the center, as well as their journey into assisted living. Empathetic and Responsible Communication – What to Remember There is no doubt that times are tough for everyone, but for seniors and their families (considering the high COVID-19 risk at their age group), it's especially scary. It is of utmost importance to remain empathetic, sensitive, and careful regarding your communications and marketing approach. Senior and Assisted Living Centers should focus on delivering timely and consistent communication, so as to suppress any fears and shine a light on what measures can be taken up. In addition to all the preparations being undertaken in line with operations, an effective crisis communication plan must be implemented. Ensure that a capable team is appointed to look after all aspects of communications during this time. They should be proactive in delivering accurate, timely, and relevant news to all the residents at the center, their family, as well as the staff members. The communications team should be able to assure the community that the center is taking the correct preventative measures by sanitizing and disinfecting the property, limiting visitation hours, and keeping a close eye on residents with the right health screening measures. It is also important to relay the same information to all the staff members, so that they remain aware of their enhanced responsibilities during this time. It is absolutely essential to have a plan of action ready if and when cases arise. The most important step is to maintain clear and transparent communication. Keep family members and the general public in the loop of any confirmed cases and subsequent suspected cases. Be proactive in sending out consistent updates with regards to the situation at the assisted living facility, while also mentioning any new protocols or decisions taken up by the management. The media gaze on senior living centers will be more acute, so it is important to designate a media spokesperson who can calmly and effectively communicate any news, if the need arises.

Few have been spared, with businesses laying off workers or shutting down entirely. Unemployment claims have hit an unprecedented 30 million as of April 30, 2020, and many fear the global market has suffered long-term damage. In the midst of the employment crisis, there are a few roles that have seen exponential growth: delivery drivers for food and other essentials, cleaners, healthcare and pharmacy workers, to name a few. Big-name companies such as Walmart and Amazon are ramping up to keep up with ever-increasing demand. The question still remains though: how can you successfully hire in these uncertain times? Here are a few challenges to hiring in the time of coronavirus: 1. Making the hiring process digital Video interviews, electronic signatures, document uploads, automated messaging - these are replacing the traditional steps in what used to be a highly personal process. Gone are the days of office tours and in-person interviews, as processes are converted to become as contactless as possible - and even conducted from home, behind the safety of a computer screen. 2. Postponed job fairs and recruiting events Recruitment agencies have had to cancel recruiting events left and right - from job fairs to campus tours, all these have been restricted as part of the directive to ban mass public gatherings. Even in this aspect, employers are looking to go digital, with events hosted on platforms such as LinkedIn Live , and on apps such as Zoom. Your company must learn to utilize online platforms as well to be able to scout for qualified candidates prospects. 3. Budget cuts for recruitment With revenue streams being severely limited, most companies are looking for ways to cut back on costs - and this includes the hiring process. As a business owner, you need to look for the most efficient and cost-effective solutions to your recruiting challenges. All-in-one hiring platforms can be one answer, so that you can digitize your hiring process and have all steps done on a single dashboard. 4. Lack of qualified applicants Given the current situation and atmosphere of rising fear of exposure and infection, it’s no wonder that there is a decrease in qualified prospects. It’s no longer enough to get plenty of applicants - they must be competent in order to prevent a rise in your turnover rate as well. 5. Low compensation for perceived risks Compensation issues go hand in hand with cost-cutting, with many hourly workers feeling that they are underpaid in light of the risks they are taking in order to keep a company’s daily operations going. Many hourly employees are at the frontline of businesses: interacting with customers, completing transactions, making deliveries. You must take the added risk into consideration and provide other compensation or benefits, where applicable. Experts say we’re in this financial crisis for the long haul, and that we’re looking at tough months ahead. If your company lacks the flexibility to learn and adapt, you could be left scrambling to survive. Workstream is dedicated to helping businesses resolve their recruiting challenges. Our all-in-one automated hiring platform has helped numerous companies save time and costs. Get a free demo today to see how we can make a difference in your bottom line.

According to the International Monetary Fund, today’s global economy has seen its sharpest reversal since the Great Depression . In March 2020, the American economy saw over 700,000 jobs lost, which ended almost 5 years of continuous job growth. Almost 10 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits in the last two weeks of the month alone, surpassing even the impact of the 2009 worldwide financial crisis. What initially seemed to be a series of speed bumps in economic activity has quickly turned into a complete meltdown of global supply and demand. In all of this madness, manufacturing businesses are scrambling to curb the rapid decline. Many industry leaders are struggling to respond to pressing questions surrounding employee job security, supply chain integrity, financial impact mitigation, and a declining demand led by market uncertainty. While the answers aren’t clear yet, here are some tips to help cushion some of the impact: Diversify, diversify, diversify In the past weeks, we’ve seen innovative manufacturers explore new possibilities to keep businesses afloat. In fact, many have made an extraordinary effort to support frontline workers, repurposing manufacturing lines and facilities in order to support the cause and generate new opportunities to sustain their businesses. Baltimore-based wire manufacturer Marlin Steel took on a unique emergency order to make wire test tube racks for coronavirus testing - a product they hadn’t once made prior to the crisis. Wherever possible, consider diversifying like they did too. Collaborate with others Alleviating the impact of the coronavirus on a national scale is too daunting and too urgent a task for any single entity to address by themselves. We need to work together—as business and industry leaders—to present a unified response . A great starting point would be the National Association for Manufacturing (NAM) , as well as state-level associations. These organizations can help facilitate cross-business partnerships and even provide great ideas on diversification based on the needs of the federal government, local hospitals, and medical professionals. Stay informed If the past few weeks have taught us anything, it’s that we live in extremely volatile times. It is therefore more important than ever to keep updated on the latest developments , especially industry-relevant news. Specifically, look out for updates on the $2 Trillion COVID-19 Stimulus bill that could be of significance to your business. Many of the discussions surrounding manufacturing provisions are still underway - such as NAM requesting the federal government to create the “Manufacturing Resiliency Fund,” which would include $1.4 trillion in loans to provide desperately needed liquidity to manufacturers and small businesses. Keep updates on issues like this, it could be paramount to surviving the effects of the global pandemic. Explore new opportunities This downturn offers the chance to take stock — of processes, manpower, technology, and opportunities. Here’s an opportunity for businesses to improve and modernize your approach and position your company to emerge stronger when the tide turns. If cashflow is a concern, there are a number of loan options available to help you through this difficult time. Prepare for the future Yes, you heard it here first - things will get better. And when that does happen, you do not want to be caught off guard. The Manufacturing Institute is already anticipating that there will be a resurgence of mass training and hiring due to future pent-up demand. To avoid a future crisis of a shortage of skilled workers, you should strive to retain your current workforce as much as possible. Maintain that employer-employee relationship, while exploring future options to grow the employee pool. In the words of Jay Timmons, President & CEO of National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), life does go on. It may be vastly different, but it has to. With the right contingency planning, we can all survive the current crisis. Here at Workstream, we’ve made it a personal commitment to help businesses during this critical period.

Coupa Cafe was founded in 2004 here in Palo Alto, right here where we are in this building. And since then, we’ve grown to 10 locations in the Bay Area. We started to grow organically in Coupa, from one location to 10 over the past few years. And, within that process, hiring is more and more difficult in the Bay Area. It got to the point where we had to hire like an in-house recruiter, to try to find employees. Everything was very manual before - lots of paper, lots of kind of misfiling and so, lots of random Excel spreadsheets where you couldn’t really figure out where people were. And it was also really hard to kind of get a hold of candidates that were applying - they wouldn’t answer the phone, some of them wouldn’t have an email. And once Workstream came along, everything completely changed for us. For us, I would say Workstream is the most efficient way to recruit new employees . With the simple ability to just publish a job, and publish it to 10 different platforms at the same time with a click of a button, it was a huge game changer for us. SMS is like a key feature to be able to communicate with them back and forth during the application process. Even if it’s just to send them a link to fill out a document, or get their availability or whatever it is. Workstream has helped us better hire the people we are looking for with the communication tools. Being able to like ask them what’s your availability or are you available Saturdays and then they say no I’m not. And then, that position requires Saturday so don’t even bring him in. The top features that Workstream has that changed hiring for us are, two-way SMS, ability to post an ad on several different platforms at once, and the organizational charts . So we can even schedule for certain positions that have like let’s say drug testing, or background checks, like it’s all on one click. It gives us the guidelines on what’s the next step and where we’re at. So it makes us continue to be efficient in making sure that everything is checked off correctly.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter 02/24/22 5 popular HR practices that will make your employees unhappy Share this article The human resources department is responsible for upholding people practices. Unfortunately, they do not always get things right which causes employee unhappiness. When HR practices go wrong, job dissatisfaction is inevitable; if left unattended, companies suffer huge losses because they depend on people to achieve their bottom line. This article walks through five HR practices that decrease employee happiness in today’s workplace. Poor traditional performance management systems Some HR executives still use traditional performance management systems, such as forced distribution method which grades and ranks employees against each other—and not against standardized goals. This creates unhealthy competition and unnecessary animosity amongst employees ultimately making them unhappy. When performance reviews are not tied to specific project objectives but rather the performance of fellow employees, job dissatisfaction is inevitable. Another poor traditional performance management practice that is still common in human resources is the field review method. The method relies only on the performance assessment from the superior's perspective. Peer reviews are not recognized here, and neither are the actual output results. This method is subjective and many times it gives unfair results that are demoralizing to employees. Conventional performance management practices include delayed feedback, inconsistency and unclear goals. The presence of these drawbacks makes employees unhappy, thereby counteracting any employee engagement strategies the company has in place. Micromanagement To avoid mistakes in operational processes, some HR practitioners adopt micromanagement. This is a management style that involves excessive control and monitoring of every aspect of an employee’s job. It’s frustrating to work in a micromanaged environment. Over-controlling behavior in the workplace reflects a lack of trust towards the employees. When you control every aspect of their jobs, leaving them little room for autonomy, they will not enjoy their work. Furthermore, not only is a micromanaged work environment stressful, but it’s also a catalyst for employee resentment, anxiety and fear. A working climate filled with suspicion is a joy killer and it cultivates a culture of hostility. It does not encourage creativity and innovation because it limits employees’ abilities, voice and expressions. The end result is high labor turnover. People leave difficult managers, not difficult jobs. Poor career development practices One of the major issues employees face today is limited access to career development opportunities. When a person joins an organization, they expect to grow together with the business. Challenges come when businesses keep growing while career progression lags behind. Not only does this stunted growth frustrate employees, but it’s also one of the biggest drivers of voluntary turnover. No one wants to be stuck with a company that does not offer attractive career development opportunities. HR departments that do not curate clear career paths for employees leads to stagnation; thereby affecting employee happiness. Furthermore, many companies offer training and development opportunities without accounting for individual employee needs. A mismatch between available development opportunities and employee’s interests brings their zeal and morale down. People learn differently, some prefer internal workshops, while some prefer conferences. Career development opportunities that do not embrace employee diversity lead to dissatisfaction. Training opportunities that do not align with the personal goals of employees diminish employee satisfaction because they limit the employee experience. Lack of employee recognition Organizations rely on their employers to achieve their ambitious business goals. People are the key to business success and they crave recognition whenever they reach milestones. If these small wins are not recognized, engagement suffers due to poor morale. A lack of recognition by management or the company undermines the talent and performance of employees. For most employees, work is much more than money, so when they do not get a ‘ thank you ’ for their daily achievements, they may feel unappreciated. Unrecognized employees feel lost in a team—they lose the team spirit. They begin to feel like they are not part of the team or company. In fact, when they lose enthusiasm for their jobs, it’s most likely they’ll leave the company. Without a positive review from superiors, employees may find it difficult to remain happy and committed to the company. Insecurity also increases when employee achievements aren’t recognized. Human resources practices that lack meaningful ways to express employee gratitude aid to employer unhappiness. Poor pay practices Pay is also one of the major sources of employee unhappiness, especially when there are discrepancies between the labor market rate and the wage given to employees. Or between top executive salaries and low-level workers' wages. When employees` wages do not match those offered by other similar businesses, they feel cheated as they see this as unfair. A high wage gap between top employees and lower-level employees creates divisions in the company. Even worse, high wage gaps between employees at the same level also cause resentment and bitterness. Employees view pay differences without justifiable reasons as discriminatory. Paper-based payroll systems such as manual pay stubs can cause discontentment amongst employees because they are more prone to calculation mistakes and they slow up the process. Not only are they tedious to prepare, but there is also the presence of human error. Thus, the absence of automated payroll technology such as an online pay stub generator affects the business operations. These days people want easy access to their payroll information wherever they are, hence the need for automated payroll processes. Conclusion Employee unhappiness drives the attrition rate, therefore HR practitioners must devise strategies to foster positivity and job satisfaction. Human resources practices must be consistently reviewed and updated. It is important to consistently gather employee feedback to make sure that your HR practices are not combating employee happiness. The goal is to strive for a satisfied and fully engaged workforce as a way of supporting business success.

The Halal Guys franchise on-boarded with Workstream 4 months ago and ever since, they have posted 18 positions for hire and had 73 applicants in a week. Workstream has effectively helped The Halal Guys increase their influx of applicants and saved them time in the otherwise time-consuming hiring process. Currently we have between Northern California and Nevada – 7 stores. We’re in a growth cycle right now and the biggest thing plaguing the QSR industry for years is finding talent . Before Workstream, our biggest hiring challenge were not getting enough applicant flow, and then also streamlining the whole on-boarding process , ensuring that all the paperwork for each employee was complete correctly. One of the three features that Workstream presents, is that there is always the influx of applicants going through the application. It cuts down on time, it streamlines the hiring process . In the past, people would apply for a job, and you would play phone tag with that person, and you would not have a good idea of what their qualifications were. With Workstream, we are able to designate a set of pre-interview questions when they apply. As a manager, we uploaded what our availability is. That helps streamline the whole initial process because a potential candidate that looks at our schedule and sets up a meeting based on the time that we’ve designated. If we like that candidate, then from within Workstream, we tell it to send the person the new hiring paperwork. By automating this whole process, we’re saving a lot of time. And then also it creates a way for us to have digital record keeping, which eliminates the need for employee files from within the store.

Over the past 25 years, he has successfully turned around businesses for distressed to start-up and growth phase companies while securing ample funding to build globally recognized brands. Gregg is a C-Suite, hands-on global operator, experienced in leading and developing teams across multiple countries, while executing strategic plans with operating budgets exceeding $100 million. Currently, Gregg is the CEO for Pieology , a fast casual pizza company with ~150 corporate and franchise locations globally. He is also the CEO and Founder of ONO Solutions, a business consulting firm specializing in strategy development and distressed turnarounds. Prior to his current duties, he was the COO for PatientSafe Solutions, where he transformed a near bankrupt, no revenue healthcare IT re-start into a revolutionary mobile clinical solution. Within one year, they sold $22 million in hospital contracts, closed $30 million in fresh capital, and launched the world's first smart device designed for direct patient care. Under Gregg’s leadership, the company successfully negotiated a business relationship with Apple to use their technologies and was named one of the Wall Street Journal's Top 50 Venture-Backed Companies. Prior to PatientSafe Solutions, Gregg worked at Highland Capital Management, L.P., a $14 billion AUM industry-leading alternative debt financial services firm, where he was responsible for leading the Private Equity strategy initiatives within the healthcare and consumer products platforms. Gregg received a Bachelor's degree in Economics/Business from the University of California at Los Angeles and is a Certified Public Accountant in the State of California. Q: What professional accomplishments are you most proud of since you start working on the Pieology project? Gregg: One of the things that we're most proud of, especially in the last year, is not only the speed in which we’ve introduced new products to the market, but also the fact that we brought innovative products which have revamped our menu. One of the things that we did was to launch a premium crust strategy that added two new crusts to our menu. Focusing on the best of indulgence and health, we launched our new deep-dish crust, with inspiration from the very popular Detroit type deep-dish pizzas. The second one that we introduced is the cauliflower crust, which is a healthier option. With these premium crusts, we are targeting two diverse sets of consumers. The first type of consumer is someone looking for something different, and a bit more indulgent and robust. The second type of consumer is looking for something healthy, yet with a unique flavor profile. Q: What are the superpowers of your team? Gregg: Historically within the food industry, the ideation process to bring a new product to market could take anywhere between 12 to 18 months. Our team is able to introduce new products to market at a much faster pace. Our sweet spot target is about six months. Bringing things to the market very quickly doesn't necessarily come without failure or its set of challenges, but for our brand, we want to be viewed as the innovators in this space. We have to take some risks and try new things to be able to bring products to market at a speed that the consumer is not expecting. Recently we launched our plant-based protein options and to do that right we needed to make a big impact, and educate consumers unfamiliar with these on-trend proteins. The vegan, vegetarian and flexitarian communities all clearly understand what plant-based proteins are, but to the everyday pizza lover, these are new to the space. We leveraged big influencers from the vegan community and from the broader pizza and food community, and used visual demonstrations of what plant-based proteins include. What went viral was our use of topiaries, similar to a giant chia pet, in the shape of a chicken, a cow, and a pig, to represent our three new plant-based proteins of chicken, meatballs and spicy sausages. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Gregg: I'm a learner leader that enjoys solving problems. I ask a lot of questions and listen to different perspectives, as they better educate me on a situation or circumstances. In the spirit of servant leadership, I lead from the front in situations of uncertainty. But my preference is to allow the team to go ahead by themselves, and I will shepherd from the rear when necessary. Workstream’s Recruiting Tip: For a team to take the lead, they must first be familiar with your company and have a common goal in mind. One way to ensure that everyone is on the same page is trough onboarding and training. With mobile training , send handbooks, checklists and training videos to your employees. These can be easily accessible via a text message link, anytime and anywhere. Both new hires and current employees will be able to familiarize themselves with company materials, and stay on track. Human resource managers will also be able to instantly review completion rates, with SMS reminders guaranteeing completion. Q: What is one piece of advice that you will give someone running a restaurant? Gregg: I think the advice I'd give is that it's really important to engage the guests. We know it's important to move them quickly through the line, and it's important to get the order right and make great food, but what we really want to do is to make a connection with the guest, and that's going to be something that's memorable. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Gregg: I think there are a lot of challenges for all of us that are out there trying to hire talent. The biggest challenge is making sure that people who are coming to your brand understand that you are more than just a paycheck. With minimum wage and other costs going up across the country, it's very easy for labor to be portable, and to move from brand to brand. If the employees don't understand what you stand for, and if they don't really see the opportunities that you can give them, then they're not necessarily going to be as loyal or be as interested in staying with you over a longer period of time. In the workforce right now, everybody's transient and people are jumping from job to job to make a little bit of extra money. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: It is crucial to hire employees that understand what you stand for, and who will be loyal to your company. But how exactly do you filter out those who may not fall within this category? The smart screening feature allows you to get applicants to upload a short introduction video. You can even use multiple choice questions and automate scoring, where only qualified candidates will move forward to the interview. This is a quick, and efficient way of determining which candidates are genuinely interested in working for your company. Additionally, data-driven analytics will allow you to understand the sources of your candidates, and see retention rates by applicant source. By identifying which platforms provide long term hires, you can also pool more resources into these platforms, to optimize your hiring process. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Gregg: The longest tenured hourly job I had was in the grocery industry. This was also my first experience working in a union environment. You had little to no control over your hours and everyone was compensated by the same tenure based wage system. It made it very difficult to earn more money and that dynamic acted as a disincentive for many workers to put in extra effort. Working in that particular job, while also working in a sandwich shop and painting homes, and my compensation was driven by how hard I worked. It made me appreciate the challenges associated with being an hourly worker, and the importance of looking for positions that would reward you based on your own performance.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/30/19 How to Effectively Hire Millennials for Your Retail Business Share this article An online search for \"millennial job statistics\" will yield a plethora of peer-reviewed articles, data-backed infographics and other resources to help your business understand how to hire this generation of workers. Why am I telling you this? Because half of the US workforce will comprise millennial workers by 2020, with that number ballooning to 75% by 2030, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you're a business owner comfortable with the prospect of recruiting only half of all possible candidates, there is no need for you to read further. However, if you are excited about benefiting from the ideas of the next generation, then please allow me to provide valuable business strategies to appeal to this obscure yet eager group of workers and make them more likely to work with you! Before expounding on ways to increase employment rates among millennials in your company, let's start by defining \"millennial\". While age ranges vary, the Pew Research Center includes anyone born between 1982 and 1996. Many millennials grew up in a post-recession economy, which impacted the entire generation just as the Great Depression did to its respective workforce at the time. One of the recession's consequences was a reduction in discretionary spending. The retail industry suffered and the aftermath is still evident today. Using retail's employment exodus as a case study, we can identify problems and find solutions to rectify it. If millennials can be attracted to work in an industry with low profit margins and a notoriously high turnover rate, they can be attracted anywhere. So, without further ado, I give you the four best ways to attract millennials to retail jobs. Be transparent about yourself and your business' direction Millennials are known to some as being professionally distracted, switching companies and jobs at a rate far greater than that of their parents. While arguably true, perhaps they're not entirely to blame for that. Great Place to Work, an analytics and consulting firm, recently published a report self-explanatorily titled, 2018 Best Workplaces for Millennials . The companies detailed in this report conduct their businesses ethically, meanwhile communicating their direction to their employees. 88% of millennials surveyed would remain employed long-term at one of those companies if given the opportunity. This statistic proves that communicative and socially-conscious companies are retaining the most millennial talent. If you tell millennials about your business, why you're passionate about it, and how you want to change the world with your ideas, nearly nine out of ten of all 73 million millennials in the current workforce will want to work with you. Learn more than your employees' names Communication goes both ways, so it is crucial to learn about millennials' passions, goals and expectations within their lives as well. Most people don't have a passion for retail, so find out why they're there working for you. Growing up in the technological revolution of the 21st century, millennials have had to be the ones to find a voice in an increasingly distracted culture. Giving them the time of the day to show that you genuinely care about their wellbeing will be a catalyst for positive change in your business. The aforementioned report concludes that millennials exhibit an eightfold increase in agility and sevenfold increase in innovation when their managers take an active interest in their employees' lives. Changing the way retail chains operate might solely hinge on the owners' relationships with employees. Change your business model The costs associated with a physical location in retail doesn't allow for competitive compensation packages for many hourly employees. This fact coupled with the current inability of millennials to work from home has caused stagnation in this industry. However, ManPower Research Group and its report, Millennial Careers: 2020 Vision will tell you that 79% of millennials prioritize a healthy work-life balance over any other job aspect. Capitalize on that by giving them work to take home occasionally. In the age of E-commerce, it may be more fiscally responsible to work from home at times. If that doesn't work, bring the home to them. Provide your millennials with a comfortable workspace. Referral bonuses for new hires can represent a quid pro quo, if you will. Your employees will enjoy the idea of getting a bonus to work with their friend, and you earn reputable (hopefully) staff. Hopefully this inspires and gives them freedom to change the brick and mortar business model. Incorporate technology As previously mentioned, the retail industry needs new ideas. Technology can be great for that. It may sound unproductive, but allowing your millennial employees access to their phones can actually help your business. Technology has made for more informed consumers, so I shouldn't have to tell you that your employees should be equally knowledgeable on the products or services their selling. Additionally, if phone and technology use at work adds to the work-life balance, endorse the policy.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/30/19 How to Best Hire Baristas for Your Restaurant Share this article Hiring people can be straining and hard work. There are numerous ways to make the process easier, quicker, and much better than constant interviews and \"trustworthy\" candidates. Hiring skilled and motivated employees is your number one priority, especially if you'll be letting someone handle your hard-earned money. This will not be a regular HR article listing obvious ways to look for employees. We will list numerous ways to find the perfect candidate, to interview them, and we'll describe how you should handle the aftermath and make them feel at home in your new business. Before even looking at candidates, make sure you know what you need. Over-hiring is bad for business, and under-hiring could cause existing employees to leave due to stress and being overworked. Hire within reason and according to your abilities and needs. Before hiring someone based on a recommendation from a friend, make sure you check their background and general work ethic. This is crucial, as people tend to recommend their family and friends, and most of the time it will be solid. But, people mostly recommend with their hearts in the right place, but not their minds. The ultimate choice rests upon you. With this in mind, we're going to walk you through some orthodox and unorthodox ways to look for potential candidates for your new and aspiring business. How to Find Barista Candidates in 12 Simple Steps Establish a great reputation for your restaurant Having a good reputation for your restaurant is a must have for any decent and smart business owner. Boosting your reputation with different kinds of advertisement , promotional deals such as \"buy one, get one free\", and offering good, fresh, and new products are sure to attract more customers. More customers equal more positive reviews and more business overall. With more people come new potential employees, so be sure to keep that in mind! A good and regular customer can also make a good and respected employee, if handled correctly. Let potential baristas flock to your restaurant by relying on word of mouth. Find out what good baristas look for in a job You can't be offering a job if you don't know what to offer. The best way to find out what you should offer your candidate is to ask a barista working in a successful restaurant. Find out what is a reasonable pay, what are the terms and conditions you should offer, and the rules your future employee should abide by. Don't try to cut corners! Paying your employee too little (or god forbid, too much) can be very bad for business. With the current young worker mentality being \"Minimum wage, minimum effort\", you need to pay your employees according to the position, their engagement, and the current market value of barista workers. Establish a partnership with local barista courses If there is a barista course in your city or near your business, you're one lucky employer! The fresh graduates are always looking for work and are most likely to accept your offer if you offer it well. Consider looking at online courses and contacting them, you never know! If you don't get the partnership with the course, don't fret! You can always advertise your business near and around it! Ask another barista for a recommendation Improving your business overall can definitely contribute to your hiring needs, so there is no need to be afraid to branch out and simply ask baristas in other successful café's where you can find your own potential employee. Never underestimate a good word from a professional! Being a barista is a profession where spoken word recommendations can take you a long way. What better recommendation than from an already established and good worker? Baristas may have worked alongside each other and may have lost their job due to undercutting and overemployment, something you should keep in mind whilst hiring. You can find a freshly let go gem just from one conversation, so this step is cardinal. Look at local based job boards Depending on your country/state/location, you most likely have at least one Job site. Now, that doesn't necessarily have to be Monster or Glassdoor, but we're pretty sure that there is a useful and helpful local alternative. Keep it local, you don't need someone three states away applying for your job. Job boards can be great, but only if you know how to play them! Don't let yourself miss out on that! Ask yourself: \"If I was a barista looking for a job, where is the first place I would look?\" The most likely answer is a popular job site. Most of them are free to register your business on and can be kept up indefinitely according to the offerings of the job site. You can always keep candidates \"in stock\" if something unexpected happens, and as history has taught us, it's always best to be prepared for the worst! Glassdoor Glassdoor offers millions of different jobs and could be your best friend in finding a new employee for your restaurant. It has a great employer section that basically speaks for itself. It's very simple to use and can be a very effective tool if used right. You can research the in's and out's of Glassdoor's great offer right on their website, which offers you a free starting post limit and numerous success stories from both employers and employees. Google for jobs One of the best \"Job Sites\" you can use is Google for Jobs . Google for jobs uses new and advanced AI technology to find the perfect job for you! It searches through all the best job sites around including LinkedIn and Glassdoor and Is an important tool to use if you're an employer. Make the AI work for you by spreading your business around all the popular sites for hiring. The age-old rule still stands up even concerning this topic, and can never be stressed enough: \"persistence equals prosperity!\" Social Media Marketing Social media marketing can be your best friend if you know how to market right. The first thing you will need to establish a good social media marketing campaign is a good designer. A good designer can help you make your business social media ready, and make it look more professional overall . You should know what kind of designer you need. There are companies that offer designs for your website or social media, but they are mostly expensive. A good and cheap alternative is to find a freelancer on the numerous freelancer sites, such as freelancer.com . You should consider hiring a social media manager. Now, managing your various social media accounts is not rocket science after all, but if you're too preoccupied with other more pressing matters, you should consider employing someone to make your job easier. Make a Facebook page A smart man once said: \"The Internet is the future of marketing.\" And he was more than right. Most people that don't use Facebook are old people and very young kids, certainly not your preferred employee type! Make a Facebook page for your business and use it to hire employees . Be sure to sponsor your posts and make sure you produce original and interesting content. Not many people are going to visit your page and stroll through millions of the same coffee cup images, so keep it different! With popularity come many opportunities, and if you establish yourself as a good employer and a good place for customers to spend their hard-earned cash, you will attract many potential employees. Make an Instagram account Instagram is just as good as Facebook to look for potential employees for your upstart business. If someone doesn't use Facebook, they most likely use Instagram. Instagram also has a business page , that can tell you all you need to know about running a business on it! Unlike Facebook, Instagram is an image sharing social media website, catering even more to your target employee base. Make yourself seen, and impossible to avoid! Cater to young audiences, since being a barista is most popular among young people aged 18-30 years old. Another plus of using social media to find that perfect employee is being able to see what they do in their own private time. You don't want to hire a problematic person to handle your money or, god forbid, ruin your product in any way, do you? See their habits and hobbies and determine if they're the right candidate for you! Make a LinkedIn account Unlike social media sites like Facebook and Instagram, LinkedIn is much more professionally oriented. People are most likely to use their best picture for the job, and offer a good description of their skills and previous work experience. This is both useful in displaying the recommendations and job experience and dangerous, because people can represent themselves better than they actually are. Hire with caution! Look at local colleges/schools Local colleges/schools can be jam-packed with crisp and fresh employees. Most of them are inexperienced, so you need to practice caution when hiring. Always look into their job history and recommendations, if they have any. You're neither a course nor a babysitter, so find someone with previous barista experience. Hire someone to hand out fliers at local hotspots. Look for artists, designers and other part timers As previously mentioned, part timers and college kids go hand in hand. If you know how to get a hold of this demographic, you can open up a whole new window to your business that can offer you much needed relief with running your business. Artists and designers make great baristas. Being a barista requires a bit of an artistic skill, even if it is only with coffee. A well made Mocha Latte and cappuccino should live up to their taste with their aesthetics, which is surprisingly hard to achieve without any art skill. Good looking drinks can also help you with the promotion of your restaurant. Combining well-presented food and drinks with a professional photographer could mean the world for your marketing efforts. Good and cheap photographers can also be found within local colleges, so you can kill two birds with one delicious stone! Always employ celebrity shifters! If you get the rare chance to employ a celebrity shifter , do so without a second thought! Celebrity shifters have the skills and the knowledge that they need to make them a exemplary employee. But be careful and ask yourself, why have they left the position they were previously occupying? If the answer is they've moved to better things and bigger positions in the restaurant business, then you're in the clear! If they've lost the position they've held in the past, be sure to check out why. Ask a hiring center Don't be afraid to seek professional help with your problem. There is no shame in getting help from someone who does it for a living. A hiring center may ask for a percent of the first or first few salaries paid to the employee but will be sure to supply employees as needed. Hiring centers can most likely be found all around your city, and are a good way to find already legally and professionally checked potential candidates for your business. You can also find them online . Most of them are government owned, and are always looking for new employers, just like you are! How to Interview Candidates and Find the Best Barista So you've finally done it. You've advertised hard, you've done the best that you could and now you have numerous applications for your job position. But what now? Well, don't fret! We've got you covered, welcome to step two of employing the best possible candidate. You need to be cautious about whom you hire. You don't want a potential bad apple to spoil your opinion of all your candidates, so make sure you keep a fresh and open mind whilst interviewing your future employees. Check out their Job History The job history can most likely tell you a lot about your potential candidate. Too many different workplaces can mean that they can't keep a job for a long time, which is certainly something you want to avoid. You don't want someone who is going to stay there for a couple of weeks and call it quits, do you? But on the other hand, too few jobs in their background can mean they are inexperienced, and that can be just as bad. You need to watch out for people who just aren't cut out to work in your bar or restaurant. If you already have one barista and need more because your business unexpectedly took off and there's a huge demand, see if your current employee is willing to teach their skills to an inexperienced new candidate. If they are, you might be able to find an employee without much hassle, and could end up with a loyal and hardworking employee for a long time, as long as you treat them right as an employer. Check out their recommendations Recommendations do matter, quite a lot actually! Look at your potential employee's CV, as if examined right, it could tell you all you need to know about them. Business recommendations, personal recommendations, friend recommendations or better yet, current employee recommendations can be a great way to get new and fresh people to work for you. As stated before, they could be potentially dangerous, but with proper thinking, you can make it work for you. If they have business recommendations, if they have worked in the field somewhere before applying to your job, ask them why they left. Did they do something wrong? Did they leave themselves? If so, think about it. Can you offer them a better workplace? If the answer is yes, still check them out! Don't be afraid to call their past employer and check out their work ethic and work history, their strengths and weaknesses, it can all be crucial to your business! First impressions matter! Now for the longest segment, you need to pay special attention to first impressions. First impressions matter for a bastion of reasons and can tell you most of the things you need to know about a candidate. Starting with the candidate's general approach to you and their attitude towards the job, there are many things and subtle body language tricks you can learn to help you pick out the best possible person for your job. Here we're going to list some tips and tricks to keep in mind whilst interviewing your candidate. The handshake. Every interview starts with a handshake. You don't want someone to hand you a wet, freshly killed fish of a weak and sweaty handshake. A firm handshake is a sign of respect among other things, such as determination and positive attitude. Watch your candidate. Someone who is distracted may not be paying attention to your offer or is there just to waste everyone's time. Now, your time is too precious and not to be wasted, so you need to keep an eye out for any signs of negative behavior. Keep an eye out for their body language. Are they nervous? Why? If they are showing signs of nervous behavior such as tapping feet, fidgeting with a pen, pencil, their hair, and looking down at their feet, ask yourself why that is. That can be a sign of uncertainty, something you need to take into account. Important things to keep in mind No one is asking your candidates to go full black tie for their interview for a barista job at a local restaurant, but do keep an eye out for their outfit. If you were going on a job interview, would you dress in filthy, trashy or indecent clothes? Of course not, and you shouldn't tolerate sloppy behavior from someone that will serve drinks in your establishment. Make a note of their general attitude. Do they really want it? Do they, without a doubt in their minds, want to put in the effort and the hours? If it seems so, then it is a good sign. But still, don't put your guard down. A soft employer is an employer who loses money! No one is telling you that you shouldn't be one of those \"cool\" employers, but business is still business, and employees are still employees. No one is stopping you from befriending your current or future employees, but a strict and functional employee-employer relationship is a general must have if you want a successful business.

Another common myth associated with hourly workers is that they are easy to find, require little knowledge, and will not influence the general bottom line of your organization. If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably because it is. Hourly workers, and let's just say it, good hourly workers are extremely hard to find, and in this market are quickly snatched by companies offering better working conditions. Furthermore, the general myth that hourly workers can come and go, and that this strategy is efficient is a pure lie . In HR, it is common knowledge that each and every worker is a part of the team and needs constant attention and care to perform well so that the whole team can prosper. You've probably read about the issue that exists with the Subway franchise model, and how they treat and pay their workers. Basically, they change them constantly, and pay them the bare minimum. And while the franchise itself insists that the users of their name (smaller owners who rent the right to use the name Subway) can decide for themselves how to pay their workers, it still reflects poorly on the brand. While companies like Subway are more interested in how, when, and where their logo is used; how you care or pay for workers is not high on their priority list. How can you use this, and draw some conclusions in order to improve motivation of hourly workers, and make them not only happier, but more efficient workers? 1. Be Predictable with Shifts Yes, hourly employers are expected to have constantly changing shifts, but still, if you want your workforce to be satisfied, you need to create a routine for them to feel comfortable. This does not only include their working hours but take into an account that most of the income for shift workers (especially in the service industry), comes from tips – and tips vary depending on the time of day. Because of this, it's a good idea that every hourly worker has the opportunity to work during busy shifts (where they can get more tips), but also to have down periods where they can enjoy a slow-paced shift from time to time. This can easily be solved with monthly shift planning. Naturally, some other unpredictable events might happen, but those should be rare – if they keep on happening, consider your planning skills ; they might need updating. 2. Keep Workplace Fun Just because someone doesn't work for you on a full-time basis doesn't mean that they are not a part of your team, that they should be neglected or not included in your team activities. Making a fun workplace will not only increase efficiency but will also boost morale. By organizing team-building events ahead of time, you can make sure that employees see their workplace in a much different light. Offer free snacks and drinks, this can help during long work hours and can save your workers a few bucks. Encouraging a few competitions that give bonuses based on performance is also a good idea – while many hourly workers simply don't see their current job as a career, they will appreciate your effort to make them appreciated. 3. Think About Their Needs While it's not easy to show your appreciation to the hourly workers – they don't receive the same benefits as your full-time employees, there are other ways to think about their needs. We've mentioned how important properly managed shifts are to them, and while all this requires a bit more time on your part, it's worth the effort. Creating a small budget that is dedicated for the best hourly worker is a good idea to start, everyone could definitely use more money in their lives. This can increase the competition that we've mentioned, and it will appear as an authentic effort from your side. If hourly workers complain, listen to them. Just because they are temporary, doesn't mean that their complaints are unfounded. By paying attention to what they have to say, you will ensure that your fully-employed personnel, and your business, are also taken care of. 4. Ask for Opinions Another important thing that most companies tend to do is completely forget about their hourly employees, not only their needs, but their input as well. Some of them might have some pretty good insight that could help the future of your company. They will have the most unbiased view of your company, and this is why their ideas might just be the best ones. Ask them to participate in decision-making meetings, to give their own ideas – most of them will shy away from such an opportunity, but some will see this as a great way of staying there longer – which is exactly what you should be looking for as well. By recognizing their potential in advance, you can quickly add valuable members to your team. Treating your hourly-workers like fully-employed will only bring good results for your business and will do wonders for their motivation . Small things can go a long way, especially if you are genuinely interested in helping them feel more comfortable working for you.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/26/19 What you should know about restaurant crowdfunding Share this article For a new restaurant to be successful, you have to ensure that you have sufficient funds in the first place to keep it running. This is one of the most challenging aspects when it comes to opening a new restaurant. Taking a leap of faith and getting stuck in a loan is by definition a risky endeavor. But what if you truly believe in your new idea and you are sure that your new restaurant will be very well received? Is there a way to get to the cash in a risk-free manner? The answer you are looking for hides in the fund-raising. Fund-raising has taken a completely new form in the digital age. You no longer have to go out to meet people in person and convince them to pledge money for your idea – you can do everything online. To help you fund-raise for a new restaurant, we decided to compile a list of all the places that make fund-raising a walk in the park. Kickstarter The Kickstarter platform is the bread and butter of convenient fund-raising. You will be able to pitch your restaurant idea to millions of people, even if you choose to do so from the comfort of your living room. Although it started as a small website 10 years ago, Kickstarter has become the go-to place for all the creative people in need of cash to bring their ideas into reality. The Kickstarter community is global and there are well over 10 million people standing by to invest their hard-earned cash in an idea they deem valuable. Why is Kickstarter good for raising funds for your new restaurant? Because it gives you complete control over your project. You will be able to create your project page on the website and present your idea down to every little detail. You can include pictures, your business plan, and market research. Basically everything you need to back up your idea. Over the course of the past 10 years, Kickstarter has made sure that almost 165,000 projects see the light of day. The Kickstarter community has pledged well over $4 billion. What's even better, once you pitch your project to the Kickstarter community, you are bound to receive valuable insight from your backers. A part of the Kickstarter community is actually keeping an eye out for interesting projects in the hospitality niche and these people are genuinely interested in helping you get enough funds to start your restaurant business. Make sure to stay tuned to that \"Comments\" section and live up to your promises if you want the backers to support you in any forthcoming projects. There are already a dozen restaurant-related projects on the platform. The platform is very easy to use and you don't have to be an IT guru to start a project, which makes it an even more convenient opportunity for fund-raising. Indiegogo Indiegogo is a platform similar to Kickstart. Their business model revolves around crowdfunding. and the platform is quite popular. There are several thousands of new crowdfunding campaigns per week. Since the Indiegogo community looks for opportunities to invest money in innovative projects as they emerge, this is a great opportunity for you. People on Indiegogo really appreciate a good story behind the project. If you decide to test your plan on this platform, we suggest you devote some time to writing a compelling story and make a list of FAQs. Lay out your plan and your intention as well. For instance, how much money you aim to raise, what you will use it for, do the backers get a pre-opening dinner treat, and so on. While we are talking about repaying the backers in some way, Indiegogo features the Perk system you can use to incentivize people to pledge more money. The founders of the platform found that campaigns with perks raise significantly more cash than those without them. Indiegogo also allows video uploading. You should consider this, as a video can help you communicate the details about your restaurant idea that would be otherwise impossible to convey. There is a comment section here as well, so make sure to reply to the backers' questions and address any concerns they might have. Foodstart Foodstart is another crowdfunding portal where you can raise funds for your restaurant. Unlike Kickstarter and Indiegogo, Foodstart only specializes in the food and beverage industry. Whether you want to launch a snack bar, a restaurant or make people happy with delicious bites from a food truck, the Foodstart community can help you achieve it. Foodstart made its services available in 2012 and since then, this platform has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs materialize their dreams. There are some very famous names from the fund-raising industry on the advisory board of Foodstart. For instance, the founder of Ingenio.com, a famous company that raised well over $100 million in private capital. There is also the former CFO of Ruby Tuesdays, who is a huge name in the food industry and who has raised over a billion in the private and public sectors combined. This platform has a similar system as Indiegogo. It uses the perks system to help the people motivate backers to give them funds. The perks system can be used to deliver discounts, free food, cooking seminars, guaranteed tables, and other attractive things. Funds Focused on Food It is important to note that once you go through the crowdfunding opportunities, you are still not out of options. There are dozens of funds focused on food and beverage. They work differently than crowdfunding platforms, but if your idea is worth their money, the chances are that you are going to get it, in some instances even with no strings attached. Unlike crowdfunding options, funds focused on the food and beverage industry are going to be there to see your operation through. This means that you will be able to tap into their network and expertise to not only kickstart your business, but to plan actions for the future, scale, and grow. Chobani Incubator Chobani Incubator is a company looking forward to investing in restaurants creating nutritious and delicious meals. Chobani Incubator's mission is to help people get to affordable food in a more convenient manner. This is why they are on the constant lookout for companies who can make that happen. Chobani's philosophy is all about DNNA – delicious, nutritional, natural, and accessible. If your restaurant is going to challenge the food industry, deliver innovations, and most importantly, truly make a difference in terms of food accessibility, Chobani is your go-to company. If you enter the Chobani program, you will be able to learn a lot about building a sustainable business, branding, marketing, scaling, packaging, pricing, and so on. Chobani doesn't want to provide you with funds and disappear. This company aims to make long-lasting and supportive partnerships with small players in the food niche. Kitchen Town Central Kitchen Town Central (KTC) specializes in food startups. This company even has its huge facilities designed to help entrepreneurs kickstart their own food and beverage establishments. But KTC is not like any other company dedicated to helping potential restaurant owners start their business. Instead of pumping funds directly into a project, KTC has a very unique business model. If you pitch your idea to them, and they like it, you will be able to use their facilities to scale up your production, bring different products to life, and even test out brand new and experimental recipes. Among the many services KTC offers, we would like to point out those of their Product Innovation Lab. KTC product development services can help you get your products from a list of ingredients on a piece of paper to food ready for market. This includes prototyping, commercialization, product labeling, and so on. Kitchen Fund Kitchen Fund is yet another door you can knock on to get your restaurant project funded. Since Kitchen Fund specializes in all things food and beverage, you will be able to receive so much more from them than just funds. Besides the cash injection, you are also going to be introduced to other important companies in the niche, including potential partners and suppliers. If you truly want to deliver a unique experience and make your customers feel like they are part of something really special, Kitchen Fun will gladly get you under its wing. They will assess your project and provide you with access to valuable resources and manpower to make it happen. You can expect to get advice in terms of marketing, branding, POS choice, growth planning, and so on. Some of the famous restaurants that started off as Kitchen Fund projects include CAVA, The Pie Hole, Inday, Curry Up Now, Sweetgreen, and many others. Cleveland Avenue Cleveland Avenue has made it clear that they want to help anyone with a great restaurant idea to start a business as soon as possible. Thanks to their years in the food and beverage landscape, Cleveland Avenue is able to support entrepreneurs not only plan their business but also sustain its growth without sacrificing the quality of products and service. The idea is simple, for the food to be delicious, it has to be made with soul, and that is exactly what new people have to offer to the hospitality and food industry in general. This company will definitely value your creativity and ambition to make a difference in this market. What does Cleveland Avenue offer besides access to financial resources? You will be able to benefit thanks to the collaboration and expertise of company employees. Some of the projects Cleveland Avenue has funded include Farmwise, Bright Cellars, FoodBoss, PizzaRev, Somrus, and many others. Enlightened Hospitality Investments EHI is one of the few strategic investors focused on helping restaurants succeed in the hospitality industry. The main goal of EHI is to identify the value-added potential of your project and help you emphasize it to make it in the market. If your project gets a green light, EHI will make its resources available to you. This includes financial aid, relevant contacts, strategic direction, and marketing strategy. EHI is devoted to helping its partners achieve sustainable growth. Their primary focus is on fine, casual restaurants. But since EHI is more focused on expansion, you might want to save this ace up your sleeve for times when you plan to conquer new markets and open up new locations. The EHI family is huge. Some of the EHI-enabled restaurants include Bay Room, Blue Smoke, Cafes at Moma, Maialino, and others. AP Franchised Concepts AP Franchised Concepts has pretty much the same business model as EHI. They are focused on investing in restaurants that are already established on the market. AP Franchised Concepts is there to help you plan and execute your growth strategy while avoiding the major pitfalls. If you are less experienced with infrastructure-related issues and business processes, AP Franchised Concepts specializes in this. This partnership will ensure that you sustain your business growth and continue to deliver the same service across all locations. Angel Investors An angel investor is a convenient name for any individual willing to invest in a business idea. In return, these investors either seek ownership equity or some sort of convertible debt. AngelList is a platform where you can present your restaurant idea to millions of angel investors around the world. Currently, there are more than 1,000 investors on this platform interested in the hospitality niche. There are other platforms to expand your search on, including Angel Capital Association and Gust. Some of these platforms organize events which you should definitely attend if you decide to go with an angel investor.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/26/19 The Journey to Building Her Own Company by Sybil Ege Share this article Sybil Ege is the Founder, President and CEO of The Business of Food - where they provide business education and business growth consulting to food entrepreneurs. With her years of experience, she has successfully founded and grown many start-ups, and worked within a wide variety of industries. We met her to find out more about what goes behind building a company, and how she does it so well. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Sybil: I spent many years in the corporate world until I finally realized it was not for me. I savored my independence, and that would often clash with management's ideas, or at least how to implement those ideas. While there was ample opportunities for growth, the environment sometimes limited innovation and thinking out of the box. Eventually, I realized it was time to be in business for myself. I learned a great deal from my corporate experience, but running my own business is where I need to be. Q: How would you describe your company culture? Sybil: One of the best parts of owning your own company is that you get to set the values for it. What is most important to our company is respect for customers and employees, honesty/integrity, openness to change/innovation, quality/excellence, and empowering others to be their best. I have two partners. Together, we have well over 100 years of experience. Superpowers come from their insight, work ethic, and fearlessness in the face of new challenges. Critical skills we bring to the table include marketing and sales expertise, very strong financial understanding, and the knowledge of how to build trusting and caring relationships with our customers. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Sybil: New hires seem to want instant gratification, but it takes time to settle into a new job and establish yourself within the organization. Even with enhanced interviewing procedures, it is difficult to understand how a new hire will really work out until after s/he is in place. As a small business start-up, it will take time before our organization really shakes out and has a stable organization chart. In the meantime, we want to hire people who will be open to new ideas, changing roles, and opportunities we cannot predict. It's not so much about what you can do now, but how willing you can adapt to change. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Video resumes are an easy way to determine the characteristics of an applicant, even before you meet them for an interview. It will also help in differentiating those with genuine interest in the job to those who simply wants a temporary gig. Through smart screening , you will also be able to use multiple choice questions and automate scoring. This is useful in filtering out candidates who may not be open to a dynamic and constantly changing environment, while simultaneously flagging out individuals who may be quick in adapting to changes. Q: Who inspires you and why? Sybil: I studied music, so my heroes are classical musicians. It's not about the money or the fame a great musician may acquire. It's about their holistic understanding of the music – their instrument or their voice, the score, their technique. They are able to embody the music completely and transport the listener. Not even the composer can totally convey the intent of the music. To be the best at musical performance takes amazing dedication to the art. It takes perseverance and always striving for excellence. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Sybil: I am lucky to have worked with some extraordinary people in my career. I now want to pass on some of the advantages I had in the work place that helped me develop and gain success. I believe you have to lead by example, and that means commitment to excellence, getting the job done on time and on budget, and a willingness to sometimes do what's needed, but not always what's fun. It is very important to educate your employees. I want to be accessible and to explain why, not just what and how things need to be done. This enables me to better understand each individuals' talents and identify future leaders. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: With everything quickly shifting to the virtual space, mobile training will be effective in educating your employees. New hires and existing employees will be able to benefit from additional training videos and checklists, all made easily accessible via a text message link. Hiring managers will also be able to review completion rates, and employees will be sent text message reminders, which guarantees completion. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Sybil: Yes, but many years ago. I was promoted early on in my career to a supervisory/managerial role.
