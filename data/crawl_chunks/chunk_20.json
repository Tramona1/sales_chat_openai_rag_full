What are the top 10 compliance interview questions every hiring manager should use? Can you provide an example of a situation where you had to navigate a complex compliance issue, and how did you handle it? Importance: This question assesses the candidate's practical experience and problem-solving skills in the realm of compliance.

This question assesses the candidate's interpersonal skills and their capacity to foster a culture of compliance within the organization. What steps do you take to ensure that employees at all levels understand and adhere to compliance policies? Importance: Communication and education are pivotal in maintaining a compliant environment. This question probes the candidate's strategies for disseminating compliance information and fostering a culture of awareness within the organization. Can you share an experience where you identified a potential compliance risk before it escalated, and what actions did you take to mitigate it? Importance: Proactive risk management is a hallmark of effective compliance. This question delves into the candidate's ability to identify and address potential issues before they manifest, showcasing their foresight and risk mitigation skills. How do you handle conflicting priorities between business goals and compliance requirements? Importance: Balancing business objectives with compliance mandates is a delicate act. This question evaluates the candidate's approach to such conflicts, emphasizing the importance of aligning business practices with ethical and legal standards. In what ways do you ensure that third-party vendors comply with our organization's ethical and legal standards? Importance: Many compliance challenges arise from interactions with external entities.

Why are compliance interview questions important? Compliance interview questions serve as a litmus test, unveiling the depth of a candidate's understanding, experience, and commitment to upholding ethical and legal standards. In an era where regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving, hiring individuals who not only possess theoretical knowledge but also have a proven track record of navigating real-world compliance challenges is crucial. These questions are the gateway to selecting candidates who can fortify an organization's ethical framework and safeguard against potential risks. What are some things to look for when conducting a compliance interview? During a compliance interview, astute observation is paramount. Look for candidates who not only articulate their knowledge of compliance principles but also provide concrete examples of their application in diverse scenarios. The ability to communicate complex compliance concepts in a clear and concise manner is indicative of a candidate's capacity to educate and influence others within the organization. Additionally, assess the candidate's attitude towards continuous learning. Compliance is a dynamic field, and individuals who exhibit a commitment to staying informed about regulatory changes demonstrate a proactive approach essential for success in compliance roles. Observing interpersonal skills is equally crucial. Compliance professionals often need to collaborate with various departments to ensure adherence to standards. Look for candidates who convey diplomacy, as well as an ability to navigate and resolve conflicts related to compliance matters. In the delicate terrain of a compliance interview, there are certain phrases and responses that should raise red flags. Avoidance or lack of clarity when asked about specific compliance experiences may indicate a lack of practical exposure. If a candidate struggles to provide tangible examples or resorts to vague statements, it might suggest a theoretical understanding without the application. Statements that downplay the importance of compliance or express a cavalier attitude towards ethical standards should be viewed with caution. An ideal candidate acknowledges the gravity of compliance and demonstrates a sincere commitment to upholding ethical principles. Watch for responses that evade questions about conflict resolution or managing resistance within an organization. A candidate's ability to navigate internal dynamics is crucial in compliance roles, and an inability to address such inquiries may signal a potential gap in interpersonal skills. Statements indicating a rigid approach to compliance without acknowledging the need for adaptability may also raise concerns. The ability to navigate ambiguity and adapt to evolving regulations is essential in compliance roles, and candidates should convey a nuanced understanding of this requirement. Finally, pay attention to candidates who lack a strategic vision for compliance. An ideal candidate not only understands current compliance requirements but also possesses a forward-looking perspective, anticipating potential risks and contributing to the development of proactive compliance strategies. The ideal compliance interview is a dynamic exchange where the hiring manager meticulously navigates through the candidate's experiences, mindset, and approach to ethical and legal standards. It begins with a series of questions that probe the candidate's practical experiences in handling compliance challenges. The ideal candidate responds with detailed examples, showcasing their ability to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios. As the interview progresses, the hiring manager explores the candidate's commitment to continuous learning. The ideal candidate demonstrates an eagerness to stay informed about regulatory changes, emphasizing their proactive approach to remaining abreast of industry developments. Interpersonal skills take center stage in the ideal compliance interview. The candidate articulates their strategies for fostering a culture of compliance within the organization, addressing resistance, and ensuring that employees at all levels understand and adhere to compliance policies. A pivotal aspect of the interview involves assessing the candidate's approach to risk management. The ideal candidate shares experiences where they proactively identified and mitigated compliance risks, showcasing their foresight and commitment to safeguarding the organization against potential issues. Towards the conclusion of the interview, the candidate discusses their vision for compliance within the organization. The ideal candidate not only understands current compliance requirements but also envisions future strategies, contributing to the organization's long-term ethical and legal resilience. Conclusion: Guiding Organizations Toward Ethical Resilience In the realm of compliance, where adherence to ethical and legal standards is non-negotiable, the interview process serves as the compass, guiding organizations toward individuals who not only understand compliance principles but embody them in their professional journey. The top 10 compliance interview questions act as beacons, illuminating the candidate's experiences, mindset, and commitment to safeguarding the organization's ethical framework. The significance of these questions lies in their ability to unveil practical insights, ensuring that the selected candidate possesses not only theoretical knowledge but also a track record of navigating complex compliance scenarios.

Approximately 3.5 million stores are in operation across the US, making the hiring landscape a very challenging one. Aaron Schweifler , Director of Operations of Sports Basement , and Brianne, Hiring Manager, shares with us how Workstream has transformed their hiring process. From a once manual task with tons of paper applications, Sports Basement's hiring process is now fully mobile, automated, and all visible on a single dashboard . During the past 9 months, they have posted 27 positions and saw 277 applications in a week. They have seen more interviews scheduled, more applicants show up, and have saved a large amount of time due to Workstream’s automated process. My name is Aaron Schweifler and I’m the Director of Operations for Sports Basement. We’ve been around for 20 years now. We have 10 stores, all in the Bay Area, and each store employs about 80 people so there's a lot of staff to maintain. We’ve always sold the best brands at basement prices but we also do a lot more: rentals, guided trips - you name it. People that come here to work are all people who basically were customers in the first place. They love what we do, they’re all bikers, hikers, skiers, and if they didn’t do one of those sports before, we pay for them to go out and do that sport. We’re all very similarly oriented when it comes to love of the outdoors and sports. The challenges we faced in hiring in the Bay Area with 800 staff and 0% unemployment, we found that the old ways of recruiting with just going to the paper applications just weren’t cutting it anymore . We needed a much more modern system to find who we needed . Our previous version of hiring was a mixture of paper applications that people would write and fill in in the store and we would have to keep in a folder. Now, everything is online. We used to email and call all our applicants by hand and now they get to pick their own time slot which just makes our job so much easier and quicker to find the best applicants . On a global level, I never used to be able to see how each of our stores were doing when it came to hiring and that worried me because I knew some stores were struggling to find the right people. Now, I can see everything, I can see how many applications we are getting, I can see the applications that are being sent in, and I can see how well we’re doing with hiring. So it really gives me comfort to see how each store is doing and each of the hiring managers at each store have told me that they love it. What makes Workstream stand out among the hundreds of other options that I get emailed about everyday is the fact that it targets hourly recruiting . I’m not trying to hire an engineer, I need 50 $15/hour people fast and Workstream’s approach is much more geared towards hiring hourly workers in the city. Before we had four managers on this one hiring dock and now it's only me doing this Workstream platform because it minimized the work that we have to do and made it so much more efficient. Workstream really has been a godsend for Sports Basement - so efficient, I’m glad we’ve had it.

They constantly work rotating shifts and it's very common that they work at more than one location, so managers and other HR professionals cannot always communicate with them on a regular basis. However, motivating and communicating with hourly workers increases their job satisfaction, and leads to better retention - which is highly critical in any industry. According to the 2019 U.S. Energy and Employment Report , there are over a million employees employed at gas stations and fuel dealerships. In the same report, 53% of those in the trade, distribution, and transport industries reported hiring as somewhat difficult, with 13% stating it is very difficult. With this challenge in hiring, it’s vital to keep employees happy. This leads to higher retention and increased ROI, but what can you do to achieve that? How can you effectively reduce your turnover rate and create a strong team of engaged hourly workers ? Here are some of the most important steps you should start with. Increase Employee Recognition A lot of hourly workers are not satisfied with their job because they don't feel supported and recognized in their workplace. According to the Randstad Employee Brand Research (REBR) 2018 , 27% of employees say that a lack of recognition is what drives them away from an employer . A great number of HR leaders are increasingly recognizing this as cause for concern, which is why many of them are introducing employee recognition programs into their organizations. According to the 2018 SHRM/Globoforce Employee Recognition Report , 84% of HR leaders say that their employee recognition program helps with employee engagement, while 89% of HR executives feel that their program improves the employee experience. If you’re currently unable to start an employee recognition program, you should at least train your managers to support your hourly workers by treating them fairly and providing them with constructive and actionable feedback. Improve Your Scheduling Process One of the most important factors for engaging hourly workers is their work schedule. Hourly workers need flexibility , but they often don't really get it. Your workers want to know when exactly they are going to work in advance, that is, all the days and times they will need to show up for work. This is not a common practice among many employers, and some tend to phone their hourly workers outside work hours and ask them to switch their shifts and promptly come to work. Needless to say, this is not at all engaging. It's actually very frustrating and it can drive away even the most loyal employees. Offer Opportunities for Professional Development Professional development is a factor that a huge number of employees are looking for when searching for a job. They don’t want to stay on square one forever, with no professional growth - they still want to have opportunities to have a fulfilling career. According to a new study conducted by Bridge , 86% of millennials say that offering career training and development would keep them from leaving their current job position. Therefore, don't let your gas station workers see their job as a temporary solution before they move to where they actually want to be. Show them that there are plenty of future growth opportunities at your workplace and help them build strong careers. Provide training courses and career mentorships, and help them learn and grow every step of the way. Introduce Healthy Competition While there are hourly workers who simply want to eventually switch to a place where they would start receiving a fixed salary, there are always those who don't think about leaving their current job to build a career. So, besides offering career development opportunities and improving employee recognition and scheduling, you should introduce some friendly competition into your workplace. According to a research conducted by Anthony Nyberg , a research director at the Center for Executive Succession, pay-for-performance bonuses can greatly boost employee engagement and performance and even generate a 213% ROI. Motivate your hourly workers with regular bonuses based on their performance, instead of giving them an annual raise, for instance. Performance-based bonuses will make them want to work harder and they'll quickly become happier with their job, which leads to higher engagement and retention. Make Your Workplace More Enjoyable Many hourly workers actually prefer a job where they don't make a lot of money but where they feel great, compared to a job that pays very well but that doesn't really fulfill them. This is why you should turn your workplace into a fun and enjoyable place that every employee will love. Provide them with an awesome break room with snacks and lots of entertainment options, where they can have fun and recharge their batteries. Brighten the workplace, continually provide exciting team-building activities, and introduce anything else that will bring all the workers and managers closer together, and make them genuinely look forward to coming to work. All of this will significantly increase engagement, motivation, and retention, and it will bridge gaps in communication, helping all employees create meaningful relationships with one another. They will eventually become a strong team that will work closely together towards achieving your goals and objectives. As you can certainly see, engaging hourly workers doesn't seem so impossible now, does it? It can be a challenging task, but all the effort really does pay off in the long run.

However, while these positions are immensely important for a company's ability to grow and offer competitively priced products, they can hardly be considered coveted positions. One such industry that particularly needs to cultivate and motivate its employees is senior living. Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, turnover rates for the senior living industry can go as high as 50% . An assisted living hourly worker faces a heavy workload, an emotionally taxing job, and relatively low compensation - and thus needs to be consistently motivated and given the chance to progress. Providing the opportunity to grow as a professional and advance within the company is a far better way to get people excited about their job than throwing a few extra bucks their way. With this in mind, let's go over some effective ways to build a sturdy corporate ladder for your hourly workers to climb over time. Enforce a healthy and positive corporate culture Statistics show that millennial workers will go through an average of 7 different jobs before they turn 30 . We're talking about jobs complete with perks and benefits, so expect hourly workers to be even more prone to job hopping. This is why the first thing you need to do is create a positive atmosphere even for entry-level jobs. Engage your hourly workers and make them feel like they're a part of a community. This is very crucial for assisted living facilities, as both the employees and the residents tend to form a bond with each other. Involving your employees in the community will ensure they are invested, and that they’ll stay long enough to start exploring different avenues of building a career with your company. Transparency in next steps Oftentimes, hourly workers hesitate in aiming for something bigger if they don't have a clear target in their sights. Make sure that there's a clear career progression for anyone who starts out as an hourly worker on one of your entry-level positions. An hourly worker in charge of creating activity schedules for residents will want to do a good job if they can see themselves transitioning to coordinator or assistant concierge in another 6-8 months. This is a general example, but there's lots of room to experiment and make the model fit your business. Provide on-the-job training and mentoring Let's say that your new hourly worker has been there for about 6 months and has moved up to a better-paid position with more tasks. They're still an hourly worker, but they're beginning to take on more responsibility within the business. At this point, you should have the more experienced workers show the junior employee around and help them get settled into their new position. This should be a part of the corporate culture and you should promote this helpful spirit. You can also have a designated mentor, a more seasoned employee with a couple of years under their belt, who would get paid a bit extra for offering some training and coaching to the younger employees. There's all kinds of mentors that can guide an inexperienced employee, you just need to make sure that there's always someone there to offer a helping hand. Offer paid training courses and specialization If someone's been working for your company for a couple of years, chances are that they already know the ins and outs of your operation. However, while they might have tons of practical knowledge and good soft skills, they  lack the more in-depth knowledge needed for higher salaried positions. You want to give employees who've shown initiative in taking on tasks and an eagerness to improve with a chance to learn and develop. Give an ambitious hourly worker an opportunity to train and try to advance. You can always restructure if things don't work out, but you'll be surprised at just how driven and hard-working some of your loyal workers can be when given the chance. Incentivize employees to work hard Simply climbing up the corporate ladder to a salaried position isn't what most people consider the end goal for their career. Always keep throwing in the right employee incentives for people to put in that extra effort. From small cash bonuses and gifts, to a few extra days of paid leave or a little corporate vacation time, all these things can really help keep your employees happy and show hourly workers that there's always more to strive for. The basic rules for keeping your hourly workers happy are treating them with respect, helping them improve, rewarding their hard work, and giving them something better and more exciting to shoot for . Once you're able to put all these strategies into practice, you'll have highly-motivated employees lining up to work for you.
