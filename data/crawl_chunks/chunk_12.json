Gastronomy, Inc., better known for their restaurants - Market Street Grill, Oyster Bar and New Yorker. With their eye on the business principle of high-quality service, casual surroundings and delicious food at a good perceived value, they were the pioneers of \"fresh seafood\" in Utah. Staying true to their business feature of excellence, Gastronomy is known for their amazing variety of fresh seafood and the quality of their steaks, which are every bit as good as the seafood. Their clam chowder, paired with delicious sourdough bread, is known all over the country. We got in touch with their Human Resources Director, Catherine Burns, to share her expertise in hiring for such a successful restaurant business. Prior to that, she worked in their fine dining restaurant (recently closed) as a server, hostess and manager. Gastronomy, Inc. employs approximately 400 individuals and her main responsibility is to ensure that they have a great work environment for the staff. Additionally, Catherine is in charge of workplace safety, food safety and Gastronomy's marketing efforts. She is also the manager of the corporate office. The organization has been highly successful because the owners and managers of its restaurants demand top performance from themselves and their employees. With more than 25 years in the restaurant business and nine successful operations, Gastronomy, Inc. continues to expand. Q: What have your experiences been in dealing with hiring hourly workers? Catherine: It has been very difficult for quite some time now. There are too many restaurants in Salt Lake City for the number of individuals interested in working in them. Line cooks and other back of the house staff are especially hard to find. Lately, we have hired some excellent servers, but that is not always the case. Unemployment nationally is low, but it is especially low in Utah. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: With Text-to-Apply posters , set yourself apart from other QSRs and make applying convenient for all applicants! This increases their chances of applying for the roles you've put out. When candidates scan the QR codes on these posters, they will also get a link to all open positions - increasing the likelihood of a successful applicant as there is a higher possibility of them finding a job opening for a job they're interested in. Video resumes are also useful in allowing you to quickly determine the suitability of a candidate, which is especially important in distinguishing whether they should be a customer-facing or backend staff. It is also a great way to find out if they are genuinely interested in the position, and whether their personality is suited for your team. Q: What has worked most for you when hiring hourly workers? Catherine: Making sure we are very clear about the expectations and then ensuring that we make the person comfortable and welcome when they start. Each new employee is assigned a mentor manager, who provides extra care for their training and well-being. Indeed is working fairly well, we have a local job board called KSL which also produces applicants. Workstream is partnering with both of these so it makes it efficient to place ads. We also have a robust employee referral program that results in new hires. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Workstream's Job Board Integrations allow you to post to over 25,000 job boards with a single click! Continue sticking to job boards you're familiar with, or explore new ones, without having to copy and paste job listings across multiple job boards. Furthermore, with data-driven analytics , you'd be able to maximize your spending on job postings, while also tracking which platforms have the highest retention rates or provide long term hires. Q: Where are your go-to channels for sourcing and hiring? Catherine: Indeed, KSL, employee referral, refuge programs, temporary staffing agencies, social media, job fairs (although usually not very fruitful). Q: What innovative recruiting technologies or methods have you seen recently? Catherine: I think the newest thing that could help us is the text-to-apply feature that Workstream has set up. Otherwise, you just have to get the word out that working in restaurants is lucrative, flexible, fun and can set a person up with vital life and/or workplace skills and behaviors. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Did you know that beyond Text-to-Apply posters, Workstream has an automated scheduling feature to optimize interview scheduling? Applicants who make it to the interview stage will receive a text message with a link to your calendar, allowing them to select a slot from pre-designated interview slots in your calendar, based on their availabilities. Thereafter, they will also be sent reminders to prevent ghosting, and are provided with the option of rescheduling should they be unable to make it for their interview.

Here's how to avoid them Share this article Usually, you’re excited and happy to offer someone the job. But sometimes, you’re in such a hiring rush that you make an offer to a less-than-perfect applicant. Unfortunately, hasty hiring decisions can harm morale, culture, and your business's bottom line. So, how can you meet recruiting needs without sacrificing applicant quality ? Defining your applicant standards before beginning the hiring process is a great place to start. Why are applicant standards necessary? Why are companies so determined to develop better hiring practices? The alternative is just too expensive. Creating applicant standards can help you easily avoid making bad hires and set your company up for success in the long run. Hiring has the potential to be a long-term issue or solution Getting the right person in the right seat is essential. A bad hire can cost an organization up to 30% of an employee’s first-year earnings . According to the Bureau Of Labor Statistics , the average hourly wage for leisure and hospitality workers is $21.07. This means that those employees make around $43,825 a year. Replacing a worker like that would cost a company $13,147, not to mention the cost of the new employee's salary. Retention is critical to long-term hiring success We know retention can greatly impact your company's bottom line. When you retain people longer, you spend less on hiring, and your customers are better cared for. Top franchises use many strategies to retain their hourly workers . From providing significant benefits to listening to team members, increasing retention is vital for every company. For example, Shake Shack focuses on sharing common values with their employees, starting with making the right hires. Hiring the wrong person can impact everyone Organizational morale is important. Working a shift with someone who is a bad fit for the organization can be a bad experience for even the best employee. According to Gallup , disengagement is having a massive impact on company culture. A whopping 18% of employees are actively disengaged, with only 32% engaged. These numbers have made drastic shifts in the last few years. Companies need to hire the right people and meet their expectations to improve the workplace for every employee. How to create your company’s applicant standards Bad hires create a toxic environment that is 10x more likely to drive existing employees away . Even a few bad hires can make it harder for everyone else . Once you’re ready to set your company's applicant standards, how do you go about it? Here are the steps you should take to decide who fits your company's culture. 1. Define your non-negotiables for the entire company Every company has non-negotiables. These guiding lights help us make the best decisions and create confidence. When creating applicant non-negotiables, think about the things you can't teach. Non-negotiables for the entire company are typically soft skills. For example, you may want your employees to be respectful or have ambition. 2. Define non-negotiables by department/role After considering the standards that will apply to every worker, it’s time to define what attributes are critical to what roles. Department and role-level standards are where the majority of applicant standards come from. Ask yourself what qualities are absolutely necessary to succeed in every position you’re hiring for. If, at minimum, an applicant meets these standards, you should consider them a good hire. 3. Make setting standards a group activity Depending on the size of your organization, setting applicant standards might be a corporate responsibility or be left to individual business locations. Regardless of where the decision lies, make sure to solicit opinions from team members across different levels of the business. Hear from other HR and recruiting team leaders, general managers, and existing workers. They know best what it takes to succeed on the job (and have probably seen enough bad hires to know what warning signs to steer clear of). 4. Create a rubric Once you have a system, write it down! Systems only work if they are readily available and easy to use. Rubrics will make hiring fair while creating an easy process for recruiters and hiring managers. Once you have a rubric, make it a part of the hiring process. It’s easy for frameworks to sit on a shelf, but checking applicants against your rubric should be a built-in step in your hiring checklist . 5. List standards in your job descriptions Are you judging applicants based on standards they don’t know about? While it might be interesting to get an unfiltered view of each potential worker, that doesn’t set them or you up for success. The job description is the perfect place to let applicants know what you’re looking for and what matters to your business. Consider how you format your description and highlight your non-negotiables using bullet points or a bolded font. Also, list your non-negotiables first or in their own section so everyone is on the same page. 6. Revisit your standards regularly Marshall Goldsmith wrote a famous book about success titled, “ What Got You Here Won't Get You There .\" This title alone is helpful to remember when considering applicant standards for your business. As your team grows, you might be looking for a slightly different applicant. Your criteria need to be fluid and evolve with your business. If you are in hypergrowth mode, you may need to revisit your standards 2-4 times a year. For most companies, reviewing your standards annually will work well. It’s not too late to set applicant standards Whether you’re a new business or you've been around for decades, it's not too late to buckle down and create applicant standards. Understanding the difference between good and bad hires can help you build a great workplace. Start by defining which traits or competencies are truly non-negotiable. From there, you can make these standards actionable by creating a rubric to judge potential employees. Last, it's important to revisit your applicant standards regularly to ensure they still work for your company.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 12/30/21 How to find employees (10 effective ways) Share this article Finding great restaurant employees is tough. And in today’s labor market, it’s harder than ever. Too many of us know someone who’s had to decrease their restaurant hours or close their lobby early (keeping only the drive-thru open) because they were understaffed. It tanks the customer experience and hits your bottom line hard. Keeping your restaurant fully staffed is a top priority. And, if you’re like most general managers or business owners, you don’t have the luxury of a company recruiter who knows all the tricks of the trade and can find employees when the need arises. But, that doesn’t mean you can’t be inventive. This post will include to options for those wondering how to find employees . 1. Strike up casual conversations with strangers As odd as this might sound, finding employees can happen anywhere—in the grocery store, at the movie theater or while in line to renew your driver’s license. As you talk to people and notice that they have qualities that would make them a great fit for your team, ask if they’re looking for work. If they say yes, let them know you own/manage the greatest restaurant in the area and would like to schedule a formal interview if they’re interested. 2. How to find employees at events (other than job fairs) Job fairs don’t always work. They’re often great for networking with other businesses, but finding employees in this environment can be really hard. A job fair is not as relaxed as, say, a social event like a  Facebook group or a Meetup. Attending a gaming event or meeting up with fellow hikers on a trail can put you in the right place. And when people are more relaxed, they are their truer selves, which creates an opportunity for both of you to candidly talk about career goals and aspirations. 3. Stay in contact with professors and mentors College is a wonderful place to find eager, hardworking people who could be a benefit to your business. If you have ever taken classes yourself, you likely have a favorite professor or two who could let you know if they recently learned of someone looking for work. And mentors can be more trade-specific and diverse. Their knowledge of people in need of work is priceless. 4. How to find employees through past applicants Just because they didn’t make the first cut doesn’t mean that they should be forgotten. If you have an open role and a few applications on file from people you didn’t hire because you had only one opening at the time, reach out to those applicants. It could be great timing for both of you. Before you reach out, make sure that you left things on professional terms the last time you spoke. 5. Use employee referral in an all-new way One of the best ways to find employees is through an employee referral program. Most referral programs today are pitched as “refer your friends and family members”—and that’s great. But, what if you deployed your team to actively scout talent? Incentivize them to bring in new applicants. 6. Advertise where your best candidates go Rent a billboard near your restaurant. Not only will you advertise your business, but you can also get word of your job opening out to more people—people who frequent your restaurant and live in the area. Also, advertise in places your ideal candidate spends time. If you need someone to lift heavy boxes, consider putting up a flier in the local gym. If you’re looking for seasonal help, check out college bulletin boards. If you’re looking for someone who can work a flexible schedule, consider churches or community centers. The key is to let your perfect staff member know that you’re looking for them. 7. Send out newsletters As you stay in contact with current customers and let them know about specials you’re having, also let them know that you’re growing your team. You never know when a good customer would love an opportunity to work for you. Don’t have a newsletter? No problem. You can communicate the same message on a note at the bottom of a receipt. 8. Create a fun video A fun video stands out better than a job posting when you’re looking for employees, and it also gives you an opportunity to highlight your business. You can show what an average day is like, the culture of the kitchen and the serving staff. You can also introduce yourself and show how excited you would be for them to join your crew. And, be sure to post the video where people are likely to see it. 9. How to find employees using LinkedIn We all know how great LinkedIn is for posting jobs and seeking out candidates. But for a wider range of people who might be interested in working for you, consider all the platforms. Actively look at profiles to see who is an energetic barkeep or outgoing hostess. Join groups and communities and engage with people’s posts. Get to know them and let them get to know you. That way, when you have that special opening, you can reach out and ask them to apply—or to refer someone else they think might be a good match. 10. Keep in mind diverse candidates You can find great candidates in all places—and from all backgrounds in life. As you look for new candidate pools, keep diverse populations in mind. These individuals may gather at community centers or events you haven’t previously visited, so be open to exploring where those places might be in your area. And, as you interview these individuals, keep in mind that they may not have the exact experience you’re looking for. Instead, be mindful of their qualities and their eagerness to learn. You can teach them the skills they need. Key point When looking for new employees, it’s important not to limit your search radius to the places you’ve always looked. Just posting a vacancy on a job board no longer works. Embrace creativity, and explore the paths less traveled. You might be surprised by your results.

In the US alone, more than 3.28 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits, with many seeing their savings entirely wiped out over the short time frame of a few months. As consumers became increasingly wary, the restaurant industry was not spared from the ill effects of the pandemic . Over 110,000 restaurants were predicted to have permanently closed. Additionally, full-service restaurants, which were hit the hardest, saw a decrease in order by 71% in the March of 2020. Even though many resumed operations, their transactions were still down by as much as 42% . The QSR industry ( quick service restaurant industry ), however, didn't experience quite as dramatic as an impact. What is a quick-service restaurants? The QSR industry is comprised of many well-known restaurants, including McDonalds, Subway, Burger King, and more. And during the pandemic, the QSR industry was the only restaurant type that moved into positive sales territory was the world was engulfed by the crisis. How exactly was the QSR industry able to flourish even in such turbulent times? Let’s dig deeper. Hiring Trends in the QSR Industry What is a quick-service restaurants ? The QSR industry is comprised of many well-known restaurants, including McDonalds , Subway , Burger King , and more. And during the pandemic , the QSR industry was the only restaurant type that moved into positive sales territory was the world was engulfed by the crisis. How exactly was the QSR industry able to flourish even in such turbulent times? Let’s dig deeper. What is QSR in the Industry? As we briefly mentioned above, QSR stands for Quick Service Restaurant , a term that broadly describes a particular segment of the restaurant market that specializes in fast food . Unlike full-service or table service establishments, QSRs offer a limited menu of food items that are quickly prepared and served. Popular restaurant chains like McDonald's , Wendy's , and Dunkin are prime examples of QSRs in America . The QSR market has seen considerable growth over the years, with a Compounded Annual Growth Rate ( CAGR ) that points to its resilience and adaptability, even amidst challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic . QSRs heavily utilize technology to improve customer experience . From point-of-sale systems to self-service kiosks and mobile apps , the industry has embraced digitalization to meet consumer demands. Market size , customer loyalty , and partnerships with third-party providers like delivery services are all crucial aspects that contribute to the success of a QSR business. What is the Difference Between Fast Food and QSR ? While the terms \" fast food \" and \" Quick Service Restaurant ( QSR )\" are often used interchangeably, there are subtle differences between them. Fast-food restaurants , a subset of the QSR industry , generally serve a limited menu of high-turnover food items at a low price. Think of classics like the Big Mac at McDonald’s or the Frosty at Wendy’s . On the other hand, fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle also fall under the QSR umbrella but offer more menu options and slightly better customer experience in terms of food quality and atmosphere. In America , the fast food industry is virtually synonymous with the QSR market , but the QSR experience can differ greatly depending on the restaurant chains involved. For example, fast-casual restaurants might have loyalty programs , partnerships with local food service providers , and a wider range of menu items , thus offering a different kind of QSR experience. Dunkin focuses on coffee and breakfast items, while Mexican chains like Taco Bell offer different menu options altogether. In summary, the QSR experience varies significantly across fast-food and fast-casual restaurants , each catering to distinct consumer preferences. Whether it's Dunkin 's coffee focus or Taco Bell 's unique Mexican offerings, diversity within the QSR market keeps dining fresh and exciting. Hiring Trends in the QSR Industry Despite unemployment across the nation, the quick service restaurant industry bucked the trend and continuously staffed up as on-premise dining resumed. Moreover, some expanded their drive-thru outlets to meet increasing demand, and more personnel were required to man their additional drive-thru booths. The industry not only thrived, but it also generated jobs for people throughout an unprecedented time. According to DailyPay, the QSR industry saw a 28% increase in hiring from May 11 to June 14 alone. To draw a clearer picture, employment in the sector rose by 1.4 million in the month of May, making up half of the increase in US employment. It is clear that the QSR industry still grew despite the setbacks from the pandemic . As we gradually moved back to pre-crisis conditions, the need to hire more people promptly continued to be vital in keeping restaurants running. At Workstream, we helped over 5000 hiring managers rehire during this reopening phase. Drop us a message here to find out how you can optimize your hiring, so you can focus on growing your business. Changing Consumer Taste and Preferences The pandemic caused the public to be more cautious of where they spent their time outside, in a bid to prevent getting infected by the coronavirus. Even as restaurants reopened, it took a while for in-restaurant dining to reach pre- pandemic levels. As such, much of the public still preferred purchasing foods that were quickly prepared for takeout than to eat in a fine dining restaurant . The coronavirus brought upon us a new normal, and getting our food fast, is among that normal. The pandemic also caused consumers to turn towards comfort food to uplift their spirits. Many now prefer foods that can provide a nostalgic appeal. And how did QSRs help them achieve such sentiment? Well, by serving the crowd’s favorites , of course! That was exactly what local restaurants in the major cities had done, and their business was able to thrive despite the pandemic , even with the new dine-in regulations. In turn, their takeout services escalated massively since that’s the only alternative way their customers could satisfy their cravings. In fact, the earnings from their takeout services were able to offset the loss they had incurred from the lack of dine-in customers. For Comal Next Door, a burrito shop located in Berkeley, their business was flourishing so well during the pandemic that they were able to open a new section location in Oakland. It is, however, important to note that comfort foods are unique to your community. So, remember to use a data-driven approach in deciding what your consumers’ favorites are before pushing them out during such a crisis! The Rise of Drive-Thrus The ability of QSRs to thrive despite the pandemic was also in part due to their symbolic drive-thrus . Since contactless services were encouraged to prevent mass infections of the coronavirus, the use of drive-thrus was as timely as ever. According to a report by the NPD Group, drive-thru visits increased by 26% in April, May, and June 2020 quarters, and made up 42% of all restaurant visits in the US. McDonald’s themselves reported that 90% of their US sales were from their drive-thru lanes and their outlets which included a drive-thru tend to pick up faster than others. Of course, they were not the only ones benefiting from this feature - fast-food chains Chipotle and Taco Bell also saw a surge in customers served through their drive-thru lanes. Aside from the fact that it attracted customers during this pandemic , drive-thrus are also ideal growth targets since they operate from a small area, resulting in possibly lower overheads. One thing’s for sure, drive-thrus are a good way to expand your QSR in times of a pandemic . After all, what better way is there to get your food than in the comfort of your car? Ease of Online Ordering The coronavirus brought about a new normal for us as we saw the implementation of working-from-home arrangements and social distancing measures, among others. Fortunately, with the proliferation of technology, this transition to the new normal was a breeze for most. With the limitations that came with dining-in and the extra precautionary measures consumers are taking, digital orders are bound to increase, and understandably so. Chipotle saw their digital sales growing 216% year-over-year while Yum! ’s (owner of Taco Bell , Pizza Hut , and KFC ) increased from $1 billion to $3.5 billion from the same quarter in 2019. With a limited dine-in capacity, many consumers were deterred by the possibility of long wait-times at their favorite restaurants. So, why not just order-in instead of going through the hassle of getting dressed, only to be disappointed by the lack of seats? Additionally, ordering online reduced the risk of being exposed to the coronavirus, which made it a no-brainer for most. The pandemic also galvanized QSR owners into expanding their digital platform or partnering up with third-party delivery services to reduce contact between their staff and the public. With their increased online presence tied in with the new normal, it was no wonder why QSRs were able to keep their business afloat amidst the ongoing pandemic . If you have not built your online platform yet, you’re really missing out. The “New Normal” Now that we’ve gone through (most of) the factors which contributed to the QSRs ’ success during the pandemic , it is time we discuss the ‘new normal’ and how we should adapt ourselves to it. To keep up with other QSRs in the industry, consider incorporating all of the above into your operations. Additionally, here are a couple of pointers you might want to take note of: Change in Schedules The implementation of work-from-home arrangements means that morning commute dramatically decreased , resulting in much fewer breakfast orders during the peak morning periods. Thus, consider making different arrangements to your staff’s shifts to accommodate the ‘new’ peak periods or even temporarily halting your breakfast options to simplify operations. Starbucks , for instance, moved its employees’ shifts towards the new peak hours after observing more customers coming in at later timings. Priority on Hygiene and Safety of Food Preparation Unsurprisingly, consumers’ emphasis on food hygiene and safety has risen in light of the coronavirus pandemic . Gone are the days where reviews involved only food quality and customer service. You can expect to see increased scrutiny on your QSR ’s operations, e.g. how hygiene is maintained on the premises. To gain the trust of your consumers, consider being transparent with your food preparations, and sanitize your restaurants right. Additionally, ensure that your employees are aware of your restaurants’ protocol and guidelines . The QSR industry, in particular, thrived amidst the pandemic as their products proved versatile enough to adapt to unprecedented situations. If you are a QSR industry franchise owner, consider expansion opportunities we have suggested above to get ahead of your competitors. While the experience of COVID-19 was incredibly challenging for many, and will continue to impact trends and habits for years to come, it's also worth reflecting on some of the important takeaways from that once-in-a-lifetime experience.

According to recent reports , from 2020 to 2021, the market size of the QSR industry in the U.S. dropped by $39.88 billion! Of course, this isn’t too surprising given that 2020 was the first year we all were forced to deal with the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. You know what is surprising though? How things bounced back in 2022 even though things have yet to really return to normal. In 2021, the projected market size of the QSR industry managed to surpass the market size of 2019 by more than $500 million. What’s behind the rebound? Well… it would be hard to single out one factor in particular. But we think the innovative strategies from several major QSR franchises may have had something to do with it! And, in this article, we want to bring a few of those innovations to your attention. Our hope is that you can learn from these examples, brainstorm ways to apply them to your QSR, and thrive in 2022! But before we take a look at those strategies and examples, let’s look at a few of the consumer trends that are driving the need for QSR innovation. Convenience is king Thanks to old and current social distancing practices, off-premise dining is still a rising trend with more customers preferring to order out than dine-in at restaurants. This is largely due to the ease and convenience of takeout and delivery. Two-thirds of surveyed customers indicated that they do not see themselves returning to dine-in regularly at restaurants any time soon. Safety remains extremely important The pandemic has forced restaurants to make cleanliness and sanitation a top priority. But, apart from that, safe food preparation is also a big concern for customers. More than half of surveyed respondents (55%) expressed their willingness to pay a premium of 10% to 50% for safety information on their food. Digitalization is the way to go Regardless of the ordering method, customers now prefer their restaurant experience to be as seamless as possible—even if that means little to no in-person interaction. Half of the surveyed customers reported a preference for using an app to order takeout. 81% of customers said they would prefer an automated voice system when ordering from a drive-thru. 5 growth strategies QSRs can apply in 2022 The next few years of the restaurant industry will be defined by innovation and growth . Here are five lessons you can learn and apply from QSRs who are already adapting to the future of the restaurant industry. 1. Exclusive privileges for app users It may seem troublesome to develop an exclusive app for your restaurant when many customers are already used to using third-party delivery apps like Uber Eats and Grubhub. But that doesn’t mean they’re not a good idea. Within your app, you have a direct line of communication with your customers and you can keep them coming back by offering special privileges for app users. For example, the fast-food burger chain Shake Shack created an exclusive curbside pickup lane for customers who placed orders using the restaurant’s Shack App. 2. Drive-thru only restaurants It may be a while before your customers feel as comfortable dining in as they did pre-pandemic. And this means you have fewer opportunities to gain their loyalty within the premises of your restaurant. So, why not improve their drive-thru experience? For example, in 2021, Ono Hawaiian Barbecue opened a new location exclusively for drive-thru and takeout orders , including only menu items that are quick to cook and easy to transport. 3. Multi-channel ordering options When you provide multi-channel ordering options, you make it easy for customers to order from your restaurant. You also make it more likely that they’ll order from you again in the future. So, make sure your customers can place orders through your website, app, third-party delivery apps, etc. Panera recently partnered with Google Maps to create a frictionless ordering process. Customers can order food from Panera within Google Maps after searching for the restaurant’s locations. 4. Partnerships with influencers How you brand and market your restaurant has evolved during the pandemic. Before, it used to be common practice for major QSRs to sponsor celebrities to appear in commercials and print ads. Now, those partnerships are happening online with influencers. For example, McDonald’s partnered with rapper Travis Scott to create the “Travis Scott Meal.” Because of the rapper’s fame, videos about this meal went viral on TikTok—even though it consisted of items from McDonald’s regular menu. Partnering with a famous rapper may be out of reach for your QSR, but partnerships with smaller, local influencers can have just as big of an impact. 5. Timely social media campaigns With few places to go without fear of COVID-19, customers have spent more of their time and money on the internet during the past two years. As a result, more restaurant owners have accepted that a strong online presence is one of the best ways to engage with customers. One of the best things you can do on social media in 2022 is to stay on top of trends and create timely promotions around those trends. For example, Roti created a “National Hummus Month” social media campaign to boost brand awareness and increase orders. The restaurant offered discounts and made charity donations whenever a customer posted a picture related to the campaign on social media. Final thoughts The COVID-19 pandemic might have slowed your restaurant’s growth down in 2020 or prohibited you from starting a restaurant at all. But now that it’s 2022, it’s time to adapt to new customer behaviors and innovate to prepare for the future of the restaurant industry! As we’ve shared in this article, you can help your restaurant continue to grow by implementing strategies like: Exclusive privileges for app users Drive-thru only restaurants Multi-channel ordering options Partnerships with influencers Timely social media campaigns And, if you want more ideas on how to help your restaurant thrive, check out the rest of our blog where we share tips on topics like the best restaurant employee retention strategies for 2022!

That’s a great start. But, how exactly do you then assess if an individual is indeed the person you are looking for? More specifically, what exactly are the right questions to ask in order to draw the right candidate? Well, let’s find out. Why and How to Conduct a Situational Interview Interviews have always been the conventional way to hire someone, even hourly workers. And understandably so. It allows us to assess a candidate’s qualities, mannerism, and whether he/she will be the right fit for the company, all of which are essential aspects a hiring manager should know before getting a new employee onboard. Asking the right interview situational questions to draw out certain skills of the candidate are imperative to know if you’ve got the right person. Most managers use interview situational questions, among others, to determine whether an individual is a right fit for the position. These are different from behavioral interview questions as they focus mainly on future situations rather than what had happened in the past. A popular framework typically used to develop questions for this type of interview is the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method. It is a valuable tool for an organization as it gives them insights on how an individual will solve problems in the future based on their past experiences. So how exactly should interviewers prepare for and conduct a situational interview for hourly employees? Here are some interview tips and tricks we have gathered for you. Top Situational Interview Questions Let’s start with the interview situational questions. To reiterate, having the right questions is of the utmost importance when conducting an interview. Thus, we have rounded up some of the good questions to ask your prospective employee before you ponder on your hiring decision. 1. “Describe a situation when you've come onto a new team or a new working environment.” This question gives you a chance to gauge how well a candidate adapts to change, especially when working with new people. Undeniably, this is important for all new hires as starting a new job means having a steep learning curve and a period of adjustment. But as hourly workers, this is an even more important trait to have considering the transient nature of the job. They might not necessarily be working with the same group of people all the time and as such, it is crucial for them to be able to adapt when their surroundings change. What to look out for in candidates’ response: Top candidates are sure to answer with responses that show they are adaptable and open to change. They will focus on building rapport in the company and know how to seek help should they need it. Additionally, look out for interviewees who are not quick to judge people or processes before learning all the relevant know-how. 2. “Describe a situation where you had to collaborate with a difficult colleague.” Asking this question allows you to assess the candidates’ communication and conflict resolution skills, both of which are key in hourly workers. Tasks held by part-time employees are, most of the time, only one part of a much bigger process. Therefore, it is essential for the top candidate to be a team player so that the company’s operations are not affected. What to look out for in candidates’ response: The ideal candidate will exude a professional attitude when communicating with his/her co-workers. They do not have to like everyone, but it is important for them to be able to work with everyone. To determine how outstanding the applicant is, look out for those who are able to achieve a positive and feasible outcome despite the conflict. 3. “What would you do if you had to work with a difficult manager?” The answer to this question says a lot about a person’s behavior towards authority, communication, and problem-solving. Needless to say, hourly workers are always interacting with their managers during their shifts. Thus, it is important for them to have the right attitude when dealing with potentially problematic situations in order to avoid ruining the workflow of their company. What to look out for in candidates’ response: A good answer here will showcase how the candidate is able to set personal feelings or disagreements aside so that they do not get in the way of working relationships during their period of employment. Keep in mind that a good candidate should be able to demonstrate emotional maturity and professionalism, above everything else. 4. “Describe a difficult problem you faced and how you approached it.” As the question suggests, asking this lets you know more about your candidate’s problem-solving skills and their thought process behind their actions. In a fast-paced environment, efficient and good problem-solving skills are definitely required from hourly employees to ensure the utmost efficiency in completing the tasks at hand. It also gives you a chance to evaluate their methods to see if it is aligned with your company’s values. What to look out for in candidates’ response: First and foremost, ensure that the interviewee’s answer has a favorable outcome due to his/her actions. A good answer will clearly lay out their thought process following the problem and how they approached it. Collaborative behavior is one strength you can look out for here. Did the candidate ask for feedback from his/her co-workers to understand the problem and come up with possible solutions before putting them into action? 5. “Describe a situation when you had to face an aggressive customer.” Naturally, this question allows you to assess your candidate’s conflict resolution abilities as well as problem-solving skills when in a public space. Most hourly workers such as front-end staff in quick-service restaurants (QSRs) are in constant contact with customers. Hence, having an unpleasant incident occurring during a shift is more likely to happen than in any other job positions. As such, it is imperative for them to tackle the problem correctly in order to avoid ruining the reputation of the company. What to look out for in candidates’ response: Similar to question 3, a good candidate should be able to show emotional maturity and professionalism in his place of work. Ideally, you would want an answer which demonstrates patience and respect for the customer, even if the customer is at fault. The ideal candidate will be able to communicate his focus on turning the negative experience for the customer into a positive one. Bringing the manager in to resolve the issue after doing everything in his/her power to solve the issue is also a good way to know that the candidate is able to seek help when he needs it, instead of escalating the situation further. 6. “Describe a situation when you received criticism.” Receiving and internalizing feedback is never easy as no one likes to admit their shortcomings. This question lets you judge the candidates’ growth potential and their ability to learn. The response given by the candidate will give you a gauge on how trainable he/ she is. After all, it is much easier to train an hourly employee when he/she is willing to learn than one who has no motivation to do so. What to look out for in candidates’ response: As mentioned before, a good candidate will always show emotional maturity and adaptability. Therefore, they will never take criticisms personally. Look out for candidates who showcase how they take in, analyze, and possibly make changes based on the criticisms they received. This shows their willingness to grow and improve themselves for the better. 7. “What would you do if you had to work under pressure?” For most part-time positions, time is of the essence especially because they are paid by the hour. And as one would expect, the tasks assigned to the job can be quite demanding when they are rushing to meet a quota or when serving customers during a peak period. This question will help in assessing the candidate’s ability to perform while under pressure, a very much sought after trait of an hourly worker. What to look out for in candidates’ response: A good candidate should be able to convey a positive outcome in his/her response. If it is not a positive one, look out for candidates who show that they are constantly improving themselves to manage stress better in the future. A solid candidate will be able to convey his/her ability to prioritize and analyze many different tasks at the same time. They should be able to show that they can manage their time well and be able to keep a clear head during a crisis in order to come up with the most cost and time-effective solution. Look out for interviewees who are able to relate his past experience to the job he is interviewing for as well. It shows that they have the ability to adapt no matter what stressful situation they find themselves in. During the entire interview, you might want to take notes of key points mentioned by your candidates. This allows you to revisit and remember your candidates’ responses which are crucial when evaluating them for the position in your company. As some individuals may not have the STAR method in mind, their responses may not be as detailed as you would have hoped. Hence, it will be good to ask them follow-up questions based on the STAR approach to probe them further in giving more details in their answers. This will give you a clearer judgment of the candidate and whether he/she will be the right fit for your company. What to do After Conducting a Situational Interview Now that you’ve completed the main bulk of the hiring process, the next steps will pertain to the evaluation of your candidates. Humans are susceptible to bias and this bias is likely to be reflected in the ratings of the candidates for the open position. Thus, conduct a debriefing meeting with the hiring manager and all the interviewers involved to ensure that a consensus is reached with regards to the competency ratings of every candidate. After all, a fair selection process is important to ensure you hire the best person for the job. During the debriefing meeting, we suggest interviewers discuss these three things - their first impression of the candidates, followed by a review of the responses and questions asked by them, and finally, voting for the top candidate based on the information shared by everyone. From here, you may want to choose the candidate for hire or select a few shortlisted applicants to move on to the next round, depending on your hiring process. At Workstream , we can help you manage your backend hiring processes so you can focus on what matters. We provide smart screening of your applicants , among others, and our services include moving applicants down the pipeline easily, requiring little to no action from you. To date, we have helped over 5,000 hiring managers streamline their interview processes. Summing Up Situational questions are, no doubt, a useful tool in assessing a candidate’s soft skills, which are important even for part-time positions. The questions we’ve gathered above are intended to help you evaluate different types of skills, from problem-solving, conflict resolution, and many more. However, this list is in no way exhaustive. Ultimately, the type of question you would want to choose depends on the traits you are looking for in the ideal candidate for your company’s job opening.

She is known for her groundbreaking efforts against the cycle of unemployment and poverty with her Food Technician training program. This training enables her graduates to step straight into jobs that offers a path forward into stability and opportunity. From a \"Chef to Schools\" volunteer to a daily commercial food columnist, an Escoffier Culinary Arts graduate and eventually Kitch'n Lyfe Skills’ Founder and Executive Director, Ze’Carter has come a long way. Beyond her achievements, Ze’Carter is also a speaker at the first-ever Ted-X Talk in Eustis and an Inductee in the Inaugural Lake County School’s Hall of Fame. A wife and mother of two, she is also the proud owner and operator of The Kitchen Cooking School with her daughter, who is also a chef. The Kitchen Cooking School is a consumer-friendly cooking school and personal chef service. When the mother-daughter team is not busy in private homes or teaching cooking classes, ZeÇarter is busy being the Executive Director and Founder of Kitch'n Lyfe Skills, a non-profit organization. Their mission is to reduce the occurrences of food insecurity among schooling children, the elderly, and youth who have aged out of foster homes - through education, enlightenment, and empowerment. The organization seeks to further its mission through basic cooking classes, a professional culinary education course that helps individuals obtain viable positions in the food industry and encourages sustainability practices. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Chef Ze' Carter: The biggest challenge that I have faced during my career is overcoming negative stereotypes. It is so cliché because when people recognize that I am a chef, they immediately ask me about frying chicken. Sure, I love a nice piece of fried chicken, but honestly, I haven't fried chicken in years. I am so much more than that. I am often initially overlooked for certain cooking projects until they see my resume or see similar projects I have worked on. Q: How you would describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? Chef Ze' Carter: The culture of my company is personal service at its best, and what fits your personal needs. We are personal chefs first, then educators. I believe the superpowers of my team are that as an African-American women-owned company, we have a unique perspective when it comes to hospitality. I grew up in the South and have learned how to express the Southern charm. But this is not always expressed when it comes to the workplace, there’s a thin line when it comes to that, and my daughter (Chef Joy) has mastered it. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Did you know that onboarding and training are fundamental in determining a company’s culture? Consider doing mobile training , where handbooks, checklists, and training videos can be sent to all employees. These documents can be accessed anytime, anywhere, and hiring managers can even review completion rates instantly. If the completion rates aren’t up to par, SMS reminders will also help in guaranteeing completion. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Chef Ze' Carter: Some of the challenges that we face in the hiring process is that potential employees want to start where they finish. Meaning, they want to walk into the kitchen and immediately stand behind the stove and serve dishes. While there are plenty of people who could easily manage this, it is vital to work your way up the kitchen brigade. Doing this creates a climate of respect for all positions in the foodservice industry, and I feel that a clear understanding of what goes on in the kitchen makes you a better chef. Believe me, a shift as a dishwasher in any kitchen will definitely give you a different outlook on how vital every person is in the kitchen. Sure \"Chef de Cuisine\" (head chef) is an obtainable goal but it is one that we all must work towards, so my challenge is helping new hires realize the true culture of the kitchen, and that teamwork is vital to survival. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Do you need an easy indicator of a candidate’s personality? Video resumes are a quick way to determine if a candidate is sincere, or simply looking for a temporary gig. By getting applicants to submit a quick video introducing themselves, perhaps only candidates who appear to be driven and demonstrates team spirit should go through to the next round. Q: Who inspires you and why? Chef Ze' Carter: My late father was and still is my inspiration. He was a chef and a giver. He was also a calm man and stayed pretty laid back even in the most challenging situations. A big giver, his motto was that God was going to hold us personally responsible for how we treat people no matter how they treated us, and that is truly sage advice. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Chef Ze' Carter: My leadership style is tough love with a splash of passion. I know that many times I am too hard on my culinary students, but I haven't had one yet tell me that I was too hard. I am a bit more relaxed with my consumer-friendly students because I realize that cooking is a life skill that many people didn't obtain as children and I don't want to turn them off when it comes to cooking. I am a team player and a firm believer that the acronym Together Everyone Accomplishes More is crucial and key to life. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Chef Ze' Carter: Oh Yes, I’ve had plenty of hourly jobs. I started working when I was 12, assisting my godmother with Wednesday night dinner at church. Each job that I had after really prepared me for the next job and in my last hourly job, I was actually promoted to an annual salary. That whole experience taught me that I never wanted to work for anyone again in that capacity. Hope to recruit quality candidates and create a power team? It all starts with the recruiting process.

As of 2016, major tech companies worldwide started changing their policies to go above and beyond government requirements. The intention was to ensure that not only their employees have more time off before and after having a baby, but also to make sure that their time off is fully paid. According to a survey by Recode in 2018, the world's major tech companies offer great benefits when it comes to parental leave for their employees. Netflix holds the first place, with 52 weeks of paid parental leave for both new moms and their partners (following either birth or adoption), followed by Microsoft and Airbnb, both offering 22 weeks of paid maternity leave (12 weeks and 10 weeks of non- birth parent paid leave, respectively). Amazon , meanwhile, holds the fifth place, right after Twitter (20 weeks for both parents), offering 20 weeks of paid maternity leave and six weeks of paid leave for non- birth parents . As of April 2020, Amazon ’s number of employees worldwide is estimated to be a whopping 935,000 , all of whom can now enjoy the benefits of its new parental leave policy . Let's dive in to what makes Amazon 's parental leave special. No More Two-Tier Benefits One key point that should be highlighted regarding this new policy is that the e-commerce giant currently provides the same parental leave benefits to all of its full-time employees , including its hourly workers. This is in contrast with the previous policy where only corporate employees, such as software developers and executives with high salaries, could enjoy the family leave perks . Now, all Amazon 's hourly employees including warehouse workers have access to the enhanced benefits as well. The overhaul of the two-tier system is possibly one of the best steps that Amazon ever took. It shows great care and interest in all of its employees' well-being , regardless of whether they are highly-paid software developers or hourly workers in operations and logistics. Benefits for Both Parents Amazon offers the benefits of paid parental leave to all of its full-time workers who put in over 30 hours per week. New moms can get 20 weeks of fully paid maternity leave , 4 of which can be taken before they give birth. After that, they can have up to 16 weeks off, which will be paid in full. Meanwhile, new fathers working at Amazon are entitled to 6 weeks of paid non- birth parent leave , even if their significant others work at another company. This paternity leave policy also applies for Amazon workers who are adoptive parents . One of its parental leave policy aspects which separates Amazon from other companies is its ‘ Leave Share ’ program . As its name suggests, through this program, their employees are allowed to share their parental leave with their partners. This is especially beneficial for those with spouses whose employers do not offer paid parental leave . Not sure how this works? Let us walk you through an example. Aaron Toso, Amazon 's PR specialist, took two weeks off when his wife, Meghan, gave birth to their daughter in September 2016. He shared the remaining four weeks of his parental leave with his wife, who doesn't work at Amazon and has no paid maternity leave . During his two weeks leave, Toso was paid his full salary by Amazon . Similarly, Meghan was also paid the same amount during her four weeks leave despite not being an Amazon employee . Toso said in an interview that, because of Amazon 's great new parental leave policy , his wife did not have to worry about getting back to work quickly. He also added that the benefit really helped them a lot as they wanted to enjoy spending time with their newborn together as a family, especially during the first few months of her life. The ‘ Leave Share’ program was, in fact, designed with hourly warehouse and fulfillment center workers in mind. After getting feedback from a number of focus groups, Amazon 's HR director, Steve Winter, and the company's CEO, Jeff Bezos, started to think on how they could improve the new parents ' experience at the company and provide them, and their partners, with an opportunity to rest besides their medical leave . \"Ramp Back\" Program Another aspect of the new parental policy which makes Amazon truly stand out from the others is the ‘ Ramp Back’ program . This program enables new parents , regardless of gender, to take up to 8 weeks of flexible work schedule and reduced work hours. The ‘Ramp Back’ initiative is beneficial to both Amazon and its hourly warehouse workers as new parents will be properly rested and much better prepared to get back to work with good mental health . That physical and emotional relief will, in turn, reflect on the company's overall success as employees’ morale will not be dampened leading to better work efficiency. Additionally, Amazon can stand to gain a better reputation for taking great care of their employees’ welfare. Parent Ambassadors With the revision of its parental policy, Amazon created a group of about 40 HR employees who act as ‘parent ambassadors’ or caregivers who help new parents stay in the loop with everything business-related while they are on parental leave . These ambassadors will stay in touch with them until they are ready to come back to work. This is yet another great benefit that all Amazon 's full-time workers can enjoy when it comes to parental leave & childcare and another reason why the Seattle -based e-commerce giant stands out from other major tech companies when it comes to the comprehensive benefits for its full-time employees . Conclusion In short, Amazon maternity leave is  a top notch benefit for the birth mother and Amazon paternity leave is becoming the standard for companies looking to give equal benefits to both dads and moms in the workforce. Amazon ’s policy is pioneering the way companies look at parental leave and the e-commerce giant is doing good work in the human resources department.

This is a multi-national company that has a business interest in various parts of the world. At the same time, this means that they employ a lot of people. Some of their employees have fix pays while others are more entry-level and paid on an hourly basis. This means that they have to put in a lot of effort to maintain their workforce and make a profit. However, let's see how the things work from the perspective of hourly workers and what you can expect at Domino's if you get a job there. How much does Domino’s pay per hour? The thing you need to understand about Domino's is that they have 400 stores which are owned directly by the company. It might seem like a lot, but this is only 10% of all of their stores. The other 90% of stores, however, are run by franchisees. Even though there are certain standards which must be honored to franchise with Domino's , the franchisees have a certain flexibility when it comes to how much they pay their hourly workers. Domino's pay will be inconsistent franchise to franchise (outside of the corporate owned franchises) because the franchisees retain the right to set the wages as they see fit and hire workers. So, some people are paid more and some are paid less, but they are never paid under the minimum hourly wage . This means that the best thing to do is to simply go directly to your local Domino's to see how employees are paid there. How much does Domino's pay per hour The job market can be tough and pay can sometime be a little lower than you’d like it to be. Some of the lowest position employees at Domino's , such as delivery drivers make around $7.50 on average per hour. In the US, the federal baseline minimum per hour is set at $7.25, meaning that this is slightly above the minimum. However, most of the hourly employees work in positions where employees get tips so their monthly earnings are actually higher. Assistant managers and general managers make significantly more and their hourly rate is very much serviceable in most states where the cost of living isn’t astronomical. Additionally, the fact that labor activists are pressuring for an increase in minimum hourly wage for all employees that work in the fast food industry, there are already changes made across Domino's . However, these changes are still made within the 400 stores that they own and run. Sadly, when it comes to franchisees, they have full control over how much they pay their hourly workers and the company cannot give them a directive to increase these wages. However, since the activists have already been pushing the wage increase for 2 years, chances are that they will be able to make it happen. It's a good place to work Domino's has a good working atmosphere. Their employees aren't exhausted, neither do they have time to spare. They have a great organization and company culture. The people working at Domino's are positive and they offer guidance and training to people that come to work there, especially younger people and those with no experience. Whether you are a pizza delivery driver , customer service representative , or a pizza maker you should have a great experience while working at Dominos . Most employees say that it is actually fun to work at Domino's and that work hours pas really quickly. The relationship with customers is at the highest level, as well as the relationships between coworkers. It is always possible to get shorter or longer hours, however the employee sees fit. Switching up is a regular thing and there are no issues here. They really allow great flexibility to employees who haven't committed themselves to the company to the fullest and they repay them this with responsibility. Job benefits and amenities Domino's offers various benefits to their hourly employees, and even though they don't pay as much as some other fast food chains they make it up with these benefits. Every employee has free meals at work, and the amount depends from one store to another. All employees are also given a discount that can range from 10% to 30% but if the store is run by a franchisee, this discount is limited to that store only. At some stores, they also offer 401k and even though there is no health insurance for hourly workers, they get paid sick leave. Overall, Domino's offers some solid work conditions for hourly workers. Still, they are adjusted to students and people who don't want to work full-time . However, if you want to advance within the company, it is possible and as you advance so does your pay and benefits.

Share this article Your business invests a lot of money in an effort to make more money, but what do you think your greatest investment is? It’s not marketing or product development; it’s your workforce. Labor is the biggest cost of doing business, which can make up as much as 70% of your total business expenses. However, you shouldn’t think of it as a cost. Think of it as an investment. And if you want to get the most return on your labor investment, you need to know how to organize your workforce efficiently. That’s where human capital management consulting comes in. What is human capital consulting? Human capital is your business’s most important resource. It’s the knowledge, skills, and experience possessed by the humans in your company. In other words, it’s your workforce. Human capital management is all about how you use those valuable resources to optimize productivity. The task of effectively optimizing productivity can be challenging. If you’re struggling to create an efficient labor force, it might be a good idea to call in a human capital management consultant. A human capital management consultant is someone who works with a business to create more economic value by reorganizing and developing workforce strategies to optimize efficiency. Their goal is to attract the right people with the right skills and experience to get the most return on the business’s payroll investment. Why is human capital consulting important to business? The average business spends most of its operating costs on labor. Wouldn’t it be nice to make sure you got the best return on that investment? Working with a human capital management consultant helps you organize your workforce (your most expensive asset) and make it more efficient. It’s like hiring a professional broker to manage your stocks — except with better dividends! With an optimized workforce, your business can operate more efficiently. You’ll have the right people with the right skills in the right positions to ensure your operations run smoothly. Your labor costs might not change, but your business will run more efficiently. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Beyond efficiency, a human capital management consultant can also help you streamline your hiring and onboarding — which is a serious issue in today’s business world. According to research from LinkedIn, 76% of hiring managers say that finding the right candidates is their biggest challenge. With human capital management consulting, you can utilize professional knowledge to perfect your hiring and onboarding processes and ensure you get only the talent that’s best suited for particular jobs. Not only will that ensure an efficient workforce, but when employees are well-suited for their positions and happy, you can also reduce turnover rates. Armed with a talented and properly placed team, along with streamlined hiring and onboarding procedures, your business can enhance its scalability. You’ll be properly staffed — both in numbers and skills — to take on whatever challenge or directional change you decide is right for your business, without worrying about as many growing pains. All of this is possible when you work with a human capital management consultant to organize your labor force. Human capital management consulting roles and responsibilities Organizing and optimizing an entire workforce is a big job. These are just a few of the primary human capital management roles and responsibilities: Recruitment – Finding the right candidates is just as difficult as organizing them (and perhaps even harder). HCM consultants help you identify the best places to source talent to keep your workforce strong and efficient. Onboarding and training – Working with a HCM consultant to optimize your onboarding processes will help you train more effective workers and boost retention rates. Employees who go through a structured orientation program are 69% more likely to stick around for at least three years. Time and attendance – Your business can’t be efficient if employees don’t arrive on time. A human capital management consultant can help you identify strategies to ensure your employees show up on time, every time, to maximize productivity. Reporting and analytics – Perhaps the most important part of an HCM consultant’s job, they use data-driven analytics to determine the best ways to organize labor to create real, measurable, company-wide improvements. Talent management – It’s not enough to just hire new employees. A human capital management consultant will find the right employees for the right position. When everyone is working toward their strengths, your business can run more efficiently with fewer hold ups or problems. Compliance – Human capital management consultants are experts with HR compliance requirements, and they can help your organization maintain compliance from top to bottom, saving you money and headaches down the road. When all aspects of your HR strategy work together, your business will run like a well-oiled machine, helping you get a better return on your labor investment dollars. That’s the magic human capital management consulting can bring to your organization. Tips to improve human capital management It always helps to work with a professional, but there are ways for business managers to improve their human capital management strategies to create more efficiency and productivity, while reducing errors and turnover rates. Here are a few tips for business owners and HR managers can implement to improve their HCM processes: Understand your workforce The key to any great labor management strategy is to understand your workforce. Take the time to get to know your employees beyond just their job title. Ask yourself a few questions about each employee: What are they good at? What are they bad at? What are their goals? Once you know the answers, think about where you can place the employee to best fit their talents. For example, you might have just hired a new accountant, but they like to talk and distract everyone in the office. If you know they’re good at talking, perhaps they’d be better suited for a job in sales. The better you can fit your employees’ skills and experience to their position, the more efficient your business will run, and the happier your employees will be — which means lower turnover and less hiring for you! Clear and constant communication Employees need communication. Whether they’ve just applied to a new position, are going through the onboarding process, or have worked at your business for years, it’s important to remain transparent with your workforce. Business is always changing, and people don’t always like change. Those two facts might seem at odds with one another, but if people are prepared for the change, there are fewer speed bumps when the time comes to implement. By maintaining constant lines of communication, employees and applicants can be better prepared for any changes coming down the road. When employees feel like they’re in the loop (even if the changes may not be considered “relevant” to the employee’s job position), they feel more engaged with the business and may even offer ideas for improvement that management might not have thought of, helping push the business to even more productivity and growth. Open pipelines to new talent Hiring is never fun, but it’s especially not fun when you’re crunched to fill a position. When change happens — whether someone quits or you want to expand to new areas — it’s important to have a steady pipeline to new talent. Understand the platforms available to you and which ones provide the highest quality talent for your needs. Don’t post a job on Indeed when LinkedIn would get you better and more qualified candidates, for example. It’s also important to keep regular tabs on your various job postings. Job seekers don’t have time to wait around for you to respond, so make sure you monitor your listings and respond to applications right away. Use the right tools to optimize HCM efficiency You wouldn’t use a hammer to put in a screw, so don’t use outdated HR processes to manage your human capital. If you really want to optimize your human capital management, it’s important to invest in the right technology. For example, a hiring software that helps you post and monitor job listings across various platforms can help you track all your open positions and quickly respond to applicants, ensuring a steady pipeline of qualified applicants. Invest in your most valuable resource: human capital Businesses always want to stretch their dollar farther, which is especially true right now! By organizing and optimizing your workforce with human capital management consulting, you can make your business more efficient, reduce turnover rates, simplify hiring processes, and get a better return on your labor investment to push your business to the next level.

Even DoorDash , an online food ordering company, has dedicated a significant amount of their resources to getting the quality hourly workers they need. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more job openings than ever before, particularly those that are paid hourly. Given the saturated market, there’s no denying the increased competition among companies in the hunt for hourly employees. Moreover, the hourly workforce is inclined to work in the gig economy. Why? It’s simple–due to the allure of referral bonuses, a flexible work structure and better compensation. As a result, building up a strong team for your business can be a pretty arduous task. But don’t stress. Although these companies are turning to monetary incentives to attract their gig workers, there are still other ways for you to attract quality hourly workers to support your restaurant. Here are four strategies to help you hire better in this competitive job market! 1. Cultivate a good team culture Though money is the main motivator for hourly employees, it’s not the sole driver. They also value a good working culture , even if they’re not a part of your permanent staff. It’s very easy for people working gig jobs—like a Lyft, DoorDash or Uber driver—to feel isolated and not part of a team. The limited interaction with people can chip away at a gig worker’s sense of belonging. So, here’s your opportunity to differentiate and stand out. Invest and cultivate a strong culture that is welcoming and teamwork-focused so that it will motivate workers to join your organization. Create a work environment your team members absolutely love so they spread the word. 2. Provide good training Contrary to popular belief, hourly workers do care about employee development programs. The importance of good training can never be over-emphasized. Training sessions can range from service training to managerial workshops that can help your team members improve their performance and fuel their career growth. Good training helps increase employee retention, improve your employees’ skills, and ultimately, improve the customer experience. It can also be a compelling perk to attract candidates to join your team. Many hourly workers may not have had the chance to receive higher education or vocational training. Most, however, are hardworking and diligent individuals who want to improve their lives and advance their careers. They’ll value the opportunity to work for a company that provides training for their career progression. After all, who wouldn't want to be given the chance to learn new skills? 3. Provide insurance and healthcare coverage Companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash do not consider their hourly workers permanent employees. Instead, they view their drives as independent contractors , despite pushback from existing gig workers. So, it comes as no surprise that these companies don’t provide insurance or healthcare coverage for their independent contractors, even though the job poses certain risks to their safety. Without the right healthcare and insurance, it can be very challenging for gig workers to prioritize their health and well-being should they or their family members fall sick. Take this opportunity to get an upper hand. By offering your employees the appropriate healthcare coverage, you increase your chances of drawing in more and higher-quality candidates. 4. Set the right goals and reward structure Another way for you to keep your hourly employees—and attract new ones—is by establishing meaningful goals that are paired with a well-structured rewards program. Clearly defined goals and rewards improve employee motivation, giving your team an extra boost to work harder and possibly stay with you longer. One way you can do this is by setting up an \"Employee of the Month\" award program where the recipient receives a reward—like a cash bonus or even physical prizes like books or vouchers. To provide more recognition, consider displaying a photo of the star employee on the wall. Hire hourly employees effectively Despite their deep pockets, companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash are still having a tough time trying to recruit the best talent. They’re in the same boat as you in that regard. That’s why competition is so fierce—and why you need to understand how you can position yourself as the better career option for job seekers. And, if you’re looking for ways to streamline your hiring workflow, look no further.

With the cost of losing an employee rising to approximately $3,500 , the turnover is hurting business productivity, team morale, and the bottom line. The key to reducing high churn is creating an environment where employees are engaged in their work and feel like they’re able to contribute in a meaningful way to the business. It helps employees get involved in, committed to, and enthusiastic about their work, which makes them happy, content, and productive. Striving for full employee engagement is a challenging task, but it’s well worth the effort. Here are five steps to help you keep—and attract more—good hourly employees: 1. Have Empathy, Lead with Heart One of the main reasons hourly employees leave a company is because of their manager or supervisor. Leaders are the first touchpoint for keeping good employees and reducing turnover, which is why how they treat employees is key. According to Harvard Business Review , 85% of HR leaders agree that it’s more important now for managers to demonstrate empathy than it was before the Covid-19 pandemic. The best managers will make an effort to get to know their employees, which, as a result, will improve engagement. Encourage your managers to approach all employee conversations and interactions with empathy. At the end of the day, what this boils down to is being sensitive and understanding of your employees. For example, responding to an employee’s concern in a timely manner is one way to show empathy, that you take their concern seriously. Businesses should also train managers to lead with heart. This means that supervisors should treat employees as fellow equals, showing empathy when needed and providing direction and guidance. Managers should also focus on an employee’s strengths rather than weaknesses. It’s also important to be sensitive to multilingual hourly employees. For more information on how to engage your multilingual employees, check out these helpful strategies . 2. Get Creative with Benefits There are a few common benefits that many businesses use as incentives to attract hourly employees. These lists of benefits may seem exhaustive, but with a little creativity, you can customize yours to stand out from the competition. For example, you can empower employees to pick up a new, cross-functional skill or give them the flexibility to break up the day-to-day routine. Both go a long way towards increasing engagement. Additionally, offering opportunities for employees to work on the weekend or different shifts, either for regular pay or overtime, provides some variety in the work and offers insight into the functions of the business. Other examples of benefits include allowing employees to paint their own parking space, buying small tokens of appreciation like gift cards to their favorite restaurant, car detailing, books, sporting events, concerts, or massages. And, of course, you can go bigger. Starbucks offers special perks, including $10,000 in reimbursement for adoption, surrogacy, or fertility procedures and 100% of tuition reimbursement for a bachelor’s degree through Arizona State University’s online program. Remember, creative benefits are not about the monetary value. Rather, they show the company’s appreciation for the employee.  For more ideas on benefits that will help you keep your best employees, check out these helpful ideas . 3. Provide a Flexible Schedule Millennials today value flexibility in their work schedule. Since 36% of the restaurant workforce is made up of millennials, it’s in your best interest to consider providing flexible work schedules to meet their needs (and yours). Some hourly employees enjoy following a routine, working the same hours on the same days so they can plan their off days. Others, however, need the flexibility to meet other demands and responsibilities: school, family, appointments, etc. Employers that can adapt and cater to the needs of their employees in a reasonable manner stand a better chance at keeping the good employees from leaving. Businesses can consider using scheduling apps to organize shifts such as ZoomShift , When I Work or 7Shifts to allow for advance notice of the shifts changes so everyone involved can plan the rest of their schedules accordingly. 4. Pave the Way for Future Endeavors Often, hourly workers use their job as a foundation to build towards the future of their dreams. When interviewing candidates, hiring managers should show their candidates how a job with them can allow them to reach their goals. Even if they decide to not stay in the same company or industry for long, the candidate/employee will remember the guidance they were given. Offer to send your employees to seminars or courses that will develop their skills that align with their career goals. 5. Seek Feedback Finally, seek feedback from your hourly employees. This helps them feel included in the business and gives you insights and ideas that you may have failed to consider. Hourly employees are often on the front line and experience things that the office doesn't hear about. Having a suggestion box is a good start. Businesses can also consider organizing regular in-person or virtual meetings with their employees to gather feedback. Keep the Good Ones Because you work hard to source, screen, hire, and onboard good employees, you don't want to see them leave quickly. Qualtrics found that the average time hourly employees stay with the business is around two years. To rise above the average, businesses can apply the five steps above and work towards a higher retention rate.

As a hiring manager or recruiter, you may find that interviewing comes very naturally, especially if you enjoy engaging in conversations for example starting with asking real life questions. Behavioral interviews are an effective way to assess a candidate's potential performance during a job interview based on their past experiences . Unfortunately, many interviewers often fail to ask the right questions - ones that can help gain insight into candidates’ experiences and assess who they are as professionals. Ideally, you’ll want to walk out of the interview session with a deeper understanding of the candidate and whether he or she is a great fit for the role and culture. Behavioral interviews are by far the most effective way to assess a candidate’s potential of performing well at a job based on their past behavior and past experiences . This helps employers understand how these candidates would behave and react in similar situations and challenging situations along with their past performance that are relevant to the job role. Before conducting any interviews, employers must define what they are looking for in a candidate, starting with a clear job description . In this article, we will be showing you the RIGHT WAY of preparing and conducting a successful behavioral interview tips . Good job candidates can smell the lack of preparation on your part as a hiring manager right away. Being prepared with targeted questions can elevate your employer branding, which could very well determine if they’ll accept your job offer. Why Conduct Behavioral Interviews Behavioral interviews are an accurate predictor of future performance To find the right candidate for a position, hiring managers should come up with interview questions that gauge applicants’ behaviors in addition to their skillsets and communication skills . Common behavioral interview questions are one of the most accurate predictors of a candidate’s future performance in identical situations by exploring historical experiences. Behavioral interviews are objective and structured The behavioral interviewing technique is part of a group of interviewing methods known as structured interviews. Structured interviews are used to objectively evaluate candidates and compare them for a position in your company by asking a set of questions relevant to the job and based on specific situations . These sets of questions tend to have a predetermined rating scale that helps the employer identify the best candidates for a position based on the answers that candidates provided. Employers must define what they are looking for in a candidate, including assessing their adaptability . Adaptability is a crucial soft skill that enables individuals to thrive in dynamic work environments, navigate change effectively, and embrace new challenges. Behavioral interviews allow for fair evaluation and fewer chances of bias Structured interviews make it easier for hiring managers to complete the job selection process fairly. This is because every candidate gets assessed using the same set of questions, which helps analyze the candidate’s ability to deliver on job duties and assess their soft skills . Why Behavioral Questions are Important when Hiring Hourly Employees According to a survey by PeopleMatter , the annual turnover rates of hourly employees across various industries are over 49% and it costs businesses a whopping $4,969 per employee. This is no surprise, considering the exorbitant cost of hiring (think job postings, wages of hiring managers , training costs). By identifying the right candidate, businesses can lower the risk of turnover, and instead repurpose the cost savings towards incentivizing employees through training and bonuses. Three main factors determine an ideal hourly employee: Availability Do you have any other commitments? Are you available to work during the weekends? Retention How long were you at your previous job? Why did you leave? Conflict resolution Describe a time when you disagreed with your supervisor? What was the situation and how did you solve it? By crafting your behavioral questions that touch on these three factors, you will be better able to identify the right candidate for the job. Interviewers should prompt further to get detailed answers. Such concrete examples include: Can you elaborate on the situation? What exactly did you do? How did it turn out? What specific roles were you taking on at that moment? How to Prepare for Behavioral Interviews Before conducting any interviews, employers must define what they are looking for in a candidate. CAPS is a simple and highly effective framework for defining your ideal candidate. Capacities - the physical and mental requirements to do the job Attitudes - customer service skills, dependability, etc. Personality - the traits needed such as temperament and assertiveness Skills - what is required to perform well on the job You may also apply the KSAOs Framework to supplement this preparation process. What knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics ( KSAOs ) are required for one to excel in this job function? What behaviors are critical to the growth of my organization? What competencies are cardinal to the success of my company that I should check in candidates? The behavioral interviewing technique adopts the competency -based approach when determining the right skills and behaviors for a position. According to Wikijob , competencies are behaviors or traits other than skills that recruiters have decided are suitable for the applicants of a job to possess. Competencies define an individual's ability to successfully carry out his or her skill in line with the company’s culture and handling difficult situations . Defining your ideal candidate shouldn’t be overly time-consuming. A great trick would be to look at the requirements for some of your current job positions and augment them accordingly. Here’s an example to demonstrate the difference between competency and skills: 5 people may be high-skilled in customer service, but perhaps only 3 can match your company’s culture . This can be time management , being an active team player, and working efficiently under high pressure. Skills are undoubtedly critical when identifying the right candidate for a role. But, in isolation, it is essential to assess if the individual will be successful in the position and have a healthy talent cycle once they join your company. By interviewing candidates based on competencies , employers determine if the job candidate can perform the duties required while still being the right fit for the organization. Based on the information gathered, a hiring manager can tell if the candidate matches the company’s culture or not apart from possessing the skill. For example, a skilled, but extremely impolite barista might be able to prepare beverages at an impressive speed. Nonetheless, the inability to communicate effectively with co-workers and even customers could be detrimental to both the work environment and the customer experience. As a hiring manager , you need to determine whether it’s feasible to make the trade-off between hard skills and workplace behavior. After determining the competencies and the problem solving skills you are looking for in a candidate, the next step is to formulate the interview questions. How to Formulate Behavioral Interview Questions behavioral-based interview questions should be formulated to extract information about an applicant’s past experiences that match the competencies of the position and your business rather than traditional interviews . This ensures that you're assessing their suitability as a team member in alignment with the job description . Each question should have a unique purpose, and you should have determined what that purpose is beforehand, along with what you’re looking for in your ideal candidates’ answer. This will make that you're assessing their suitability not only as an individual contributor but also as someone who can actively contribute to the team through effective teamwork . To help develop clear, concise, and effective questions, you can adopt the STAR model . The STAR Model The STAR model is a popular framework used by interviewees to answer behavioral questions . Nonetheless, many hiring managers often adopt the model to formulate effective behavioral questions as well. This prompts candidates to provide comprehensive and detailed responses to each behavioral question , allowing hiring managers to have greater insights into a candidate’s profile. STAR is an acronym for S ituation, T ask, A ction, R esult. Here is an example of a framework for developing a behavioral question using the STAR model: Workstream Tip: You can consider evaluating the effectiveness of your questions by simulating interviews with incumbent employees. These employees should be applying similar competencies in their daily work at the office. Sample interviews help evaluate the effectiveness of the questions and can be useful in developing more probing questions. Remember, the goal is to gain insights about a candidate’s behaviors around your target competencies. When you’re refining the behavioral questions, be mindful and sensitive to the verbiage. There are certain questions that you should avoid asking at all costs ! How to Create a Rating Scale After crafting the right behavioral questions for the job role you’re hiring for, the next step is to develop a rating scale to evaluate the candidates based on their responses. Rating scales can be as simple as having two options: “satisfactory” or “unacceptable” which gives hiring managers an easy time when it comes to decision making . However, this would mean that there will be many candidates who could potentially have the same score. It is recommended to adopt a more complex rating scale to enable variations in results and provide a better comparison between candidates. Hiring managers can adopt a rating scale that is similar to the Likert scale in their assessment. Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS) Behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) are designed to concentrate on specific behaviors deemed necessary for performing well in a job function. While most rating scales focus on general characteristics of the candidate, BARS is more precise and intentional. For example, a superior answer should be presented as an X behavior, a satisfactory answer as Y behavior, and an unacceptable response as Z behavior. The best behaviors should be tied to the highest rating on the rating scale, while the worst behaviors are lowest. To develop a BARS rating scale, you can use the critical incidents technique . It entails asking the occupants of the same position the kinds of behaviors that lead to successful or poor outcomes in situations they encounter in their daily work. Hiring managers can then review the responses to determine the appropriate behaviors to anchor onto the BARS rating scale. How to Conduct a Behavioral Interview To conduct the interview process efficiently, hiring managers should ensure that the lead questions are addressed to each applicant in the same wording and order. The answers should also be evaluated using the same scoring system to promote fairness. Selecting the interviewers Opt for interviewers who have a deep understanding of the job role and can critically assess the competencies required for high performance. This could be the direct manager or supervisor of the incoming applicant. The best interviews should also be able to hold a comfortable discussion with the candidate without making it sound like an interrogation. Workstream tip: It is advisable to use the same interviewer for all interviews in a single position to ensure consistency in the BARS ratings. Opening the interview How you interact with the candidates during the interview plays a huge role in determining if your company can successfully identify and retain the top talent. You can set the tone right by providing a comfortable environment for the interviewee to openly share their experiences and thoughts, allowing you to assess their fit as a team member based on the job description . To ease the nerves of an interviewee, consider asking the applicant to describe an interest, probably something in his or her resume. Here are questions you can ask: Tell me more about some of your hobbies and interests. Tell me about your background and tell me a description of how it relates to this job position. Tell me about your present or past job. Why did you choose it? You can also go through the job position and the details of what the job expectations and responsibilities are. This helps applicants to provide answers to their experience that is relevant to the job role you are hiring for. Introducing behavioral questions During this stage, the interviewer should be able to take clear and accurate notes as the interviewee answers the questions. If the interviewees are not providing clear answers, try to probe them to elaborate more on the exact steps taken and results achieved. Opt to focus on questions that reveal evidence about the applicant’s accomplishments and how they tackled obstacles, as well as those that allow interviewees to showcase their contributions to a specific achievement rather than as a team. Interviewers can use probing questions to get detailed responses from candidates based on verbal and non-verbal cues. These questions can be asked in the following few scenarios: The initial reaction to the lead question is evasive and vague, or the interviewee doesn't understand the question at all The interviewee’s responses become negative The interviewee struggles to form an answer and mumbles along While probing questions are not prepared in advance, they can help you gravitate the candidate’s response in the right direction. Some examples include: Can you tell me more about…? Can you give me an example of …? Can you come again? I missed this part... Taking notes Note-taking enables you to revisit the interviewee’s response and access them on the same rating scale. However, do note that you shouldn’t spend too much time taking notes as it could portray a negative impression on the interviewee. Your core responsibility as an interviewer should be to connect with the interviewee on a personal level. This requires you to be present most of the time by maintaining eye contact. Bonus tips for effective note-taking: 1. Use short phrases that summarize detailed responses 2. Find a balance between taking notes and maintaining eye contact 3. Don’t rate an interviewee’s response during the interview 4. Ensure the rating you give to the candidate matches the content of the notes Closing the interview Before ending the interview, do check with the interviewees if they have any further questions for you. This is usually the time to clarify further details of the job such as the salary, benefits, hours, etc., ensuring they have a clear understanding of what is expected of them as a team member according to the job description . Additionally, consider asking if they have any remaining thoughts or concerns that may warrant follow-up questions or further discussion. As an interviewer, you should answer the questions comprehensively and manage the expectations of your candidates appropriately. Workstream Tip: If the candidate seems to be a good fit for your company, be sure to let them know what the next steps are. Keeping candidates engaged after the interview is crucial.  Giving interviewees an idea of the timeline could put their minds at ease while they nervously wait on your follow-up call. After Conducting a Behavioral Interview After an interview, it is critical that you have a structured follow-up process with swift and clear communication in order to land the ideal candidates. Did you know that 56% of candidates are left with a poor impression of the company if they consider the recruitment process to be overly lengthy or unorganized? In fact, 44% of applicants expressed that they would share this negative experience with their peers. A lengthy process can sometimes leave candidates feeling detached from your brand, and its negative impact could extend past recruitment, and possibly damage your brand as well. Workstream helps you overcome this challenge by customizing your follow-up process ahead of time so that managers have clear instructions and expectations on how to proceed. Set clear timelines and stick to them Establish realistic next steps with the candidate. With Workstream, these follow-ups can be communicated via automated text messages and emails . To further personalize the applicant experience, we recommend giving them a call as well - after all, clear and personalized communication often reflects well on both you and your brand. Internal Alignment and Feedback If multiple interviewers were involved, it is important to discuss the varying perspectives each hiring manager has about the candidate. Workstream’s hiring platform allows multiple managers to score candidates, add notes, and leave feedback asynchronously, which allows for a more efficient vetting process. Making the hiring decision Once the hiring decision is made, prepare the necessary documentation before contacting the applicant. Your offer letters should include details like job title, compensation, benefits, and expected start date. Of course, the start date depends on the availability of the candidate. Nonetheless, it is an essential component of the offer, and can sometimes be the deciding factor for many candidates. All of the administrative paperwork can be prepared ahead of time, and can even be automated as templates with a hiring platform like Workstream. This way, all you have to do is extend the offer over the phone for an added personal touch!

Apart from roasting whole, high-quality coffee beans that have a heavenly taste, the global coffeehouse chain also encourages human connection. As stated in the company’s mission , it strives \"to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time,\". And this doesn't refer only to its customers, but also to all of its employees, which Starbucks refers to as “partners”. Starbucks employment benefits go far beyond free coffee and regardless of whether you are part-time or full-time employees , all of Starbucks Partners can be eligible for the company's benefits package , termed as \"Your Special Blend\". This special blend is customized to match every Starbucks employee's needs and includes a wide range of awesome perks that eligible Starbucks ' partners (i.e. employees working 20 or more hours a week) can enjoy. Read on to explore the benefits included in the package to see why it is absolutely perfect for hourly workers. Healthcare Coverage If eligible Starbucks workers ever need dental services (preventive, basic, and major ones) or vision services, which include getting eye exams, contacts, lenses, and frames, the Starbucks benefits package has them covered. All of these are parked under the healthcare coverage that Starbucks provides. It also includes various medical expenses, including hospitalization, emergency care, prescription drugs, and many other treatments. Health insurance is becoming a must have in the fast-casual/QSR space and Starbucks part time and full time employee benefits are among the best in the industry. What’s more, employees can enjoy the perks of reimbursement accounts, namely Dependent Care Reimbursement Account (DCRA) and Health Care Reimbursement Account (HCRA), which help them cover their dependent care and healthcare expenses. Life Insurance All Starbucks ' employees eligible for benefits will get basic life insurance coverage. Retail employees get $5,000 coverage, while non-retail and salaried ones get coverage that equals the amount of base pay they receive annually. Supplemental coverage is available as well but, naturally, it costs more. Non-retail and salaried employees, who can get the coverage of up to four times their base pay, can get it through automatic payroll deductions. On the other hand, retail employees can purchase their chosen coverage, which is in flat dollar amounts of $10,000, $25,000 and $45,000. Disability Plan Coverage In case an illness or injury prevents a partner from working, their disability plan coverage can provide them with partial income. There are Short-term and Long-term Disability coverage plans, the latter being provided automatically only to non-retail and salaried employees where the company pays the full premium. Meanwhile, retail employees can choose to purchase a Long-term Disability insurance plan. Employee Assistance Program (EAP) If any employee working in the U.S. is dealing with stress-related problems, emotional issues, personal concerns, or any critical workplace incident, they can receive short-term counseling to help themselves out. For Starbucks , mental healthcare is just as important as physical healthcare . As such, this program is established as it helps its partners feel better by improving their mental health , ultimately enhancing their overall quality of life. CUP ( Caring Unites Partners ) Fund The CUP Fund is yet another incredible benefits program that all Starbucks employees can apply for. It provides financial assistance to any worker who needs it after a natural disaster , illness, family death, or any other extreme case. Commuter Benefit Program Employees who need to commute to work can also save money on their commuting expenses , as Starbucks will enable pre-tax payroll deductions . Adoption Assistance If any Starbucks ' employee decides to adopt a child, the company will provide them with $10,000 for the necessary adoption expenses. The coffee company will also give them up to 6 weeks off so that they can spend time with their child in his/her new home. Additionally, they will still receive their full pay for the time off. Starbucks College Achievement Plan While the aforementioned benefits are definitely astonishing, the College Achievement Plan may just be the best one. Starbucks invests in its employees and wants to help them get a college education, even if it is completely unrelated to a career at the coffee company. Starbucks encourages its partners to get a bachelor's degree by providing them with full- tuition coverage for all four years at Arizona State University . The tuition at ASU is about $15,000 a year, but everyone who enrolls in the program automatically receives a scholarship of 42% of the full tuition. Under the college achievement plan, Starbucks covers the remaining 58% of the full tuition, which means that the students in the program need not worry about their tuition fees as it will be covered fully for them. According to a Starbucks ' press release , 1800 employees signed up during the first month of the College Achievement Plan back in 2014, and the numbers keep surging to this day. The plan includes over 70 undergraduate degree programs that are delivered online. Even better, Starbucks provides them with a dedicated enrollment coach, academic advisor, and financial aid counselor, so that they can have the best possible support system they need to earn their degrees and improve their lives. The employees who receive the tuition reimbursement don't have to keep working for the company after they graduate. They just need to ensure that they continue working there while undergoing their studies. Tying employees to the company that way is certainly beneficial to both parties, which is precisely why Starbucks started the plan. It helps the company significantly decrease its turnover rate and save a lot of money in the long run, which it would otherwise spend on recruiting and training every new employee. Apart from all these benefits, \"Your Special Blend\" benefits package also includes perks such as vacation, holidays, sick pay, as well as coverage plans for employees' partners, spouses, and children, which adds a cherry on top of this incredible package that is difficult to find anywhere else. \"Your Special Blend\" truly is perfect for hourly workers, especially since each of them can tailor it to their individual needs. Every company should consider taking a page from Starbucks ' book and work towards providing their hourly employees with the much-needed benefits that can improve their lives. By following in the coffee giant's footsteps, they can create a culture where every employee is equally valued, respected, and seen as a partner, allowing them to grow and work in an inspiring community.

People from all around the world flock to California to find their place under the sun since it definitely seems like an ideal place to live with your family. And let’s not forget to include walks on the beach and weekend brunches to complete this picture-perfect life. With the presence of big companies, alluringly high salaries, and great perks, you might wonder - what are the most demanded hourly jobs in the area and how much do these workers typically get paid? According to a survey by Payscale in 2015, restaurant workers in San Francisco are the highest-paid when compared to other cities like New York City and Los Angeles. In more recent news, grocery and retail hourly workers who make less than $35 an hour will see an increase in their wages by $5 per hour due to the pandemic. This hazard pay is passed in San Francisco and other bay area cities. From these, you might have guessed that hourly jobs in this area are generally higher paid than other cities in the US. Take a look at the following list to find out which are the most sought-after hourly jobs in the Golden City and how much you, as an employer, should be paying your workers. The following list is based on hourly rates found in Glassdoor’s and Indeed’s job listings. 1. Customer Service Representative A customer service representative holds the responsibility of interacting with the customers and meeting their demands. This position can be found in any industry, from fitness to retail. There are morning, evening or late night shifts and the rates may differ for each shift. Typically, hourly workers in this position are paid from $18 to $20 per hour . 2. Personal Fitness Trainer Given the specialization required for the job, personal fitness trainers probably earn one of the highest among the hourly jobs listed here. They can earn from $25/hour to as high as $82/hour . If you are opening your own gym and looking to hire some personal trainers, consider their qualifications and years of experience to determine their hourly rate. 3. Delivery Driver The hourly rate for delivery drivers depends on the industry and the amount they are delivering. If they are handling fast food, the wage ranges from $11 to $17 per hour . If they are delivering food in bulk or bulky items the rates are higher and can reach as high as $22/hour . 4. Part-time Elderly Caregiver An elderly caregiver can earn from $12 to up to $23 per hour . As the job role requires some expertise in handling the elderly, the hourly rate depends on the number of years of experience the individual has. Aside from that, the ability of the elderly has to also be taken into consideration. Caregivers who are responsible for those who require more assistance should be paid higher than those in charge of more abled ones. 5. Kitchen Assistant The job responsibilities of a kitchen assistant can get very extensive as they can include washing, preparing ingredients, and even cooking. As such, you should provide a wage that corresponds reasonably to what they are expected to do. In San Francisco, the typical rate of a kitchen assistant ranges from $11 to as high as $19 per hour . 6. Cashier Cashiers in this area earn in the range of $11 to $17 . The hourly wage given to them differs based on the industry. Some have a higher possibility of receiving tips than others, so do take this into account when determining your hourly rate. 7. Bartender A bartender’s wage can vary widely depending on the nature of the establishment. Usually, it ranges from $10 to $17 per hour though it can go as high as $24/hour if the bartender is based in a hotel bar. As with any other positions listed here, the wage should correspond to the number of responsibilities assigned to the individual. 8. Server As the name suggests, servers take orders and serve customers their food and beverages. Your hourly rate should depend on the type of food establishment your business will take on. High-class restaurants have a higher rate as the servers’ job responsibilities are more than that of a, say, fast food restaurant server. Commonly, servers are paid $16-30/hour . 9. Warehouse Assistant Warehouse assistants are usually in charge of receiving and sending products from the warehouse. Their responsibilities include the packing of these goods and safely moving them. Individuals typically get paid from $14 to $21 per hour due to the labor-intensive nature of the job. Additionally, you will also want to be sure to provide them with safety guidelines while working in the warehouse. 10. Sales Associate A sales associate is one of the more commonly found hourly jobs in San Francisco. Most of the time, these associates do receive a commission for selling your products. So, do take this into consideration when you decide on your hourly rate. For this position, individuals are paid between $11 to $17 per hour , depending on the types of goods they sell. While this serves as a guide to how much you pay your hourly employees, there are other benefits that you should factor in to attract job seekers. Your benefits package may include healthcare coverage, insurance, and even college fee assistance or subsidies. Consider taking a page from Starbucks ’ very own benefits program to make your prospective employees feel appreciated. By doing so, you can reduce your turnover rate and minimize additional hiring costs that can substantially lower your company’s expenses in the long run.

Wearing donated clothes and shoes. Working at the local public library. Surviving on state welfare to put food on the table. Taking care of his younger brother while his mother took on two jobs at a gas station and supermarket to keep the lights on at home. This was the life of Thuan Pham when he arrived in the United States from Vietnam as a refugee. He was only 11 years old. Pham was born in Vietnam in the late 1960s, to parents who barely finished high school. Due to the political situation in Vietnam, it was increasingly unsafe for Pham and his family to stay in the country, and his mother made the decision to leave the country. She sold everything they had in order to pay for the journey, but failed to escape several times, as the arranged boat never showed up. It finally did; but during the journey, Pham and his family encountered and were victims of pirates twice. When they finally landed at a refugee camp in Indonesia, they lacked shelter and sanitation for weeks, but ended up spending 10 months there. Pham would swim to nearby islands to buy candies, which his mother would then use to trade for bread for the family. Pham's mother believed that it was better to leave their home country than to risk her children growing up without opportunities for a better life. Eventually, Pham's family arrived in suburban Maryland in the United States, where he started a new life. In Maryland, Pham worked hard and hustled as a teenager - to do well in school, to overcome the language barrier, and to work to support his family. He quickly became the adult in the family, taking care of his younger brother and completing household chores, while washing cars and working at the local public library. He would often work long hours, washing cars on the weekend to earn extra money, even when it was cold in the winter. At the local library, he developed an interest in coding by fiddling around with the public computer terminals. This was when he started to realize he had a natural affinity for programming. In order to further develop his newfound interest, Pham volunteered his services at the local government agency, National Bureau of Standards Publications. Using Lotus, he automated the entire accounting system for the team within 3 months. As a result of his extra-curricular involvement and excellent academic record, Pham was admitted into MIT to study computer science in 1986, and graduated in 1991. In the same year, Pham saw his father for the first time in ten years - he finally got a visa to visit the United States for Pham's MIT graduation. From MIT, Pham went on to work at HP Labs, Silicon Graphics, DoubleClick, and VMWare. Pham had always favored working at smaller companies in his career. He started off his career at HP Labs, which provided a research-focused and academic environment, allowing him to focus on learning the latest technologies. However, he soon had the desire to explore something new. In his career, Pham always prioritized learning. He was not afraid of a company failing, because as an immigrant, he had the mindset that one could always start afresh if need be. He then joined Uber in 2013 as the Chief Technology Officer, when the company was present in 60 cities and employed about 200 people. Finishing up our conversation on market street off downtown San Francisco, I was curious about how Pham gets around these days, and if Uber provides their CTO with ride-hailing services to make his journey to work more comfortable. As Pham stood up to return to his desk, he shared that he has been taking the Caltrain (California's public transport system) everyday, from San Jose to San Francisco. It is a 3-hour commute daily, but he spends his time wisely by clearing emails or doing one-on-one with his colleagues for feedback.

He began looking for a job, any job would do, as he was an immigrant to this country. Like many in the industry, he went to a restaurant - a small Cuban restaurant, to be specific; and applied for his first job. Jose was hired as a prep and fryer cook. He was not familiar with cooking, nor could he speak English or Spanish, both of which proved to be a challenge. How exactly did he end up who he is today? We conducted an interview to find out more. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Jose: I consider myself a visionary leader. I'm always coaching and communicating my vision and goals for the future to my cooks. I think it's very important to make sure everyone is involved. I want to inspire my team members. Q: How you would describe your company culture? Jose: The business is family-oriented, from the concept down to the staff and operations. The team superpower is definitely the long term employees that enhance the quality of work and mindset needed for success. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Jose: One of the biggest challenges I have faced is building a team in the kitchen, and it has happened more than once. When you have the responsibility of leading the kitchen, building a solid back of the house team is essential for success. I have definitely had challenges with seasoned employees that did not respond well to change of any kind. However, I found that taking the time to show them the goals and the \"big picture\", made it easier for them to make the adjustments they needed, in order to contribute to the success of the business Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Jose: I believe one of the challenges today has to do with recruiting. The whole process of contacting quality candidates and setting up an interview sometimes takes too long, and we end up loosing them. I guess I am more \"old-school\", in that sense. I still believe in going to the job location, introducing yourself and trying to meet with the chef or manager, despite the fact that it is becoming more difficult to do nowadays. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Job board integrations and text-to-apply posters help in contacting quality candidates, saving you time in copying and pasting job descriptions across multiple job boards. Furthermore, automated scheduling and integrated calendars allow candidates to schedule their own interviews, doing away with the hassle of setting up interviews. Reminders will also be sent prior to the interview, ensuring that candidates turn up for the meeting, or reschedule it to another time of their convenience, effectively reducing the instances of ghosting. In light of COVID-19, face-to-face interviews are also harder to come by, and many organizations are gearing towards virtual interviews . Video resumes make it easier to determine a candidate's interest in the position, while smart screening will also allow recruiters to use multiple choice questions and automate scoring. This automates the entire hiring journey, which makes recruiting a more seamless and efficient process. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience? Jose: Of course! I had many hourly jobs in the beginning of my career. When I started working in the restaurant business, I was a prep cook, then a busboy, and food runner. Q: Who inspires you and why? Jose: Chef Rafael, my \"Cuban father\" from Hard Grove Cafe in Jersey City, NJ. He took a chance with me and gave me the opportunity to work in his kitchen as my first job in the United States. He was patient, talented, and taught me what a great leader should be. It is because of him that I found my passion for cooking and became who I am today. Want to stay on top of hiring trends? Schedule a chat with us to find out more!

My first encounter with Zoom was when my high school friend requested that I use the software for a video conference call. As with all users, I was initially reluctant, hoping to stick to platforms which were familiar, such as Skype or Google Hangout. However, the video call experience with Zoom was seamless, and exceeded my expectations. It occurred to me that I was a laggard in adopting Zoom in Silicon Valley - all my friends were already using it. Today, Zoom is valued at over a billion dollars, having recently received venture capital funding of $100 million led by Sequoia Capital (a total funding of $145 million). Eric Yuan is co-founder and CEO of Zoom, and we had the opportunity to meet him for an interview, where he shared more about his experiences. In 1997, Yuan immigrated from China to the United States, specifically Silicon Valley to pursue his dream of starting a successful technology business. \"I read in the news about technology leaders like Jerry Yang from Yahoo and Jeff Bezos from Amazon.\" Yuan felt that if they could do it, so could he. He started out as one of the founding engineers for WebEx, the video conferencing tool for enterprises which was acquired by Cisco for $3.2 billion in 2007. When he first arrived in the United States, he was unfamiliar with the English language. However, through sheer grit and determination, he powered through and became one of the top engineers at WebEx. Yuan was then promoted to the Vice President of Engineering. However, when WebEx was acquired by Cisco, he was frustrated by the change in direction of the company from its original mission - to create the perfect video conferencing tool. This led Yuan to leave WebEx and start his own company, Zoom. When he first came out to work on Zoom, many people discouraged him from doing so, stating the reason that the market was saturated. However, Yuan had spent a lot of time talking to customers, and confirmed that they were not happy with existing video conferencing solutions. Customers had complained about the video conferencing experience repeatedly but no company was satisfying that need. After raising a seed round of funding from angel investors, friends and WebEx senior executives, Yuan started Zoom. His mission for Zoom, which still remains true to today, is \"Delivering Happiness\" to users, employees and stakeholders. Yuan believes in leading by example and often points to Andy Grove's statement \"Only the paranoid can survive\" as his motto in business. In the first two years of Zoom, Yuan focused exclusively on hiring engineers and getting the product right. He personally led product development and worked closely with his team to talk to customers and design the product. Zoom was finally launched in 2013. It was quickly adopted by tech companies in Silicon Valley and beyond, who were eager for a better video conferencing tool. Today, the San Jose-based company (just down the street from Cisco) has over 500 employees, and over 200% Y-O-Y revenue growth in 2016, servicing over 18 billion annual minutes, with 50% of the Fortune 500 and 90% of the top 200 Universities as customers. Through sheer determination and drive, Yuan has achieved his dreams of building a phenomenal technology company, and reinvented video conferencing.

Next Wednesday, Workstream's Chief Hiring Expert, Blake Harber, will be walking you through how Domino's operators hire, which job boards deliver, and how they've changed their hiring and training process during COVID to ensure contactless delivery. Sign up here! The June jobs report came too soon. More than 4.8 million jobs were added last month , which is a new record in a year of breaking jobs records. This pushed unemployment down to 11.1%; still an incredibly high number, but hugely positive in light of the continuing pandemic and economic slowdown. Here's how that jobs spike looked in context : Unfortunately the spike in jobs paled in comparison to the spike in COVID cases over the past couple weeks; cases that the June jobs report could not have factored in due to the timing of the research. This is why many economic experts are cautioning us to temper expectations as many states re-close bars, restaurants, and other retail stores . Compounding the dire outlook is that the additional unemployment benefits are set to run out this month unless we see quick moves from the government, which we probably will. The pandemic aid programs have saved 51.1 million jobs -- a success despite its flaws -- so it's likely that more stimulus is coming which should continue to prop up hiring. The Takeaway : The June jobs report may have painted a too-rosy picture of the state of jobs, but with more stimulus incoming (probably) and states opting not to completely shut down a second time, the US may not see another giant drop in employment. The virus is not yet contained, but now that a fairly successful jobs protection program has been tested, its coffers can be replenished to continue floating the economy. A new set of pandemic-related skills and qualifications. Workers are reinventing themselves during the COVID crisis . Be it ambition or just recognition that some jobs won't be coming back, many are acquiring new skills to position themselves for a much different jobs market when hiring resumes in earnest... or to position themselves to get hired at a pandemic-proof job right now. Similarly, hourly workers may have to add new skill sets, and show them off on their resumes to get hired in a post-COVID job market. It's likely that tele-skills (conducting online interviews & training , online customer service, etc) as well as pandemic skills (taking customer temperatures, understanding of new safety and health measures) will be sought after when hiring retail workers. A sobering example might be teachers. While schools are debating whether to bring students back onto campus or not for fall, and thereby sowing uncertain about rehiring teachers , virtual teaching jobs via companies like Springboard and Pathrise are in demand . The teachers that have added online learning to their skill sets are the ones who are being hired. The Takeaway : We're living in a world where private companies are hiring epidemiologists . Jobs are changing and so are their requirements. As workers re-calibrate, hiring managers will want to update their job posts to reflect these new skills that will be important to businesses moving forward. Here comes group interviews and 4-hour hiring. Inc.com recently published a short piece on the changes they see to hiring, the focus being hiring quickly via a virtual and automated hiring process . A company named Teleperformance aims to hire 15,000 US customer service reps for their clients in the next 3 months: \"The company's recruiters have turned its virtual hiring process into a near science... After group phone interview, individual follow-ups, and final interviews with a potential manager-- on average-- successful candidates can receive job offers just three or four hours after their first interview.\" Group interviews? That's a level of hiring-fu that we don't see very often. But conducting them virtually can make it seem less strange, especially if potential employees are becoming more accustomed to video meetings with multiple people at a time. Have you considered group interviews via video? Something to think about. The Takeaway : This level of speed and efficiency can only come with hiring software in place to facilitate pre-screening, tracking interviews, vetting candidates, and sending out offers. It seems companies are accelerating their hiring to take advantage of the large pool of talent currently looking for work. The slower a business takes to hire, the more talent they will ultimately miss. Need help hiring the right people? Workstream can help.

But some time has gone by, and the referrals aren’t exactly pouring in as you expected. Are your employees to blame for not stocking your applicant pool? The biggest mistake HR leaders make with employee referral programs is treating them like set-it-and-forget-it initiatives. Employee referral programs need to be regularly monitored and optimized to ensure you’re adapting to changing hiring needs and employee behaviors. If your referral program isn’t performing well, these three factors could be to blame. And here's what you can do about it. 1. Revisit your incentives Asking employees to refer their friends and family to work with them might sound like a small request, but often there are relationship dynamics at play. Not only is their reputation on the line at work if they refer an unqualified applicant, but they also might feel uncomfortable if their referral doesn’t get hired. The best way to overcome these employee concerns is to offer incentives when a referral gets hired. This motivates your team to refer applicants they truly feel are a good fit and rewards them for doing so. So, what if you have incentives in place and your employees still aren’t participating in your referral program? Your rewards might not be attractive enough. Sure, you could test out different incentives every so often to see what works, but the fastest way to find the right incentives for your team is to ask them. Send out a company-wide survey or poll and see what motivates them. Throw out suggestions like a referral bonus, an extra day off, gift cards, or even charitable donations in their name. You can also give employees the ability to suggest incentives themselves. 2. Simplify your program No matter how attractive the incentive is, if your employee referral program consists of too many steps for your employees and/or referrals, you’ll have a hard time getting people to participate. Your employees might refrain from sending their friends and family to an unpleasant referral experience and encourage them to apply on their own instead. And while this still gets you more applicants, you’re now losing the ability to track the effectiveness of your program. Even worse, you might lose those potential referrals altogether. Take a look at your referral process and find ways to streamline it. Are you asking too many questions? Only ask for the information you need (for the referrer and the referee). Is the intake process too manual? Consider using an online form, adding a field to your applications, or even allowing employees to send an email to the hiring manager. 3. Re-promote your program One thing HR leaders can always do more of is talk about the programs they build. Even if you made a big splash about your employee referral program when you launched it, chances are you haven’t re-promoted it recently. Since you launched it, new employees have come on board, and existing employees probably forgot all about it. Consider ways to consistently communicate about your referral program, whether that’s adding quick blurb in monthly company-wide emails or newsletters or publicly celebrating employees who’ve referred new hires. This point extends to applicants and new hires as well. Talk about the program in job descriptions to raise awareness with potential applicants and show that recruiting is part of your company culture. Reiterate the program during the onboarding process, so new hires have it top of mind too. Review and optimize. Often! Setting up the components of a referral program is the first step to success. But what differentiates a good referral program from a bad one is what comes after you launch. It’s not just about creating the program and leaving it to run itself, but rather, consistently going back to it to see what can be done to optimize and improve. A little maintenance goes a long way to building a program that fills your applicant pool with qualified potential employees.

One crucial component of this is the job interview; what was once a more personal, face-to-face element of hiring has gone digital as well. While a video interview has its share of benefits (no need to pay for travel expenses, reduced no-shows, easier scheduling, etc), many people are finding it challenging to adapt to it. As an HR professional, what can you do to embrace this change? Check out our pointers on conducting the best video interviews ever. Set the stage It’s doubly important to give the best first impression to your prospective employees, as they’ll only be seeing you - and by extension, the company -  through the lens of a simple video call. Regardless of whether you’ll be conducting your interview at the office or at home (the most likely option), choose a tidy space that has good lighting and minimal background noise. Place your mobile phone on silent mode or out of your reach to help minimize distractions. In addition, you should prepare in the usual ways: ready your questions, tailor-fit to the applicant’s work experience and what role they’re applying for. Dress the part and make the effort to look as professional as you would in an office setting. Check that you have all the right files or presentation materials, if needed. Test your tech Think Murphy’s law - what could go wrong? Your laptop could freeze, or your mic or camera might be defective. Test your equipment well ahead of time to make sure everything you need is working fine. Video conferencing tools also have different requirements. Popular app Zoom , for example, has a list of recommended specifications for a seamless call experience, such as bandwidth of at least 1.8 Mbps for receiving and sending HD video. You can check your internet speed via this handy link , or ask your IT staff for more details on your hardware. Workstream tip: If something still goes wrong during your video interview, don’t panic! Here are a few things to try or keep in mind: If your internet connection seems laggy, move closer to your router or try turning off your video. Leave and then rejoin the meeting (make sure to give your applicant a heads up). Try an alternative app; your computer may be having problems with a specific software. Call your applicant via mobile phone to give an update if you need to restart your computer or troubleshoot for a few minutes. If you are still experiencing issues after 5-10 minutes, it may be best to reschedule. Keep your applicants informed Make sure to share information with your applicants. Aside from the scheduled time, it may be good to let them know the estimated duration as well. Keep in mind that your applicant is most likely at home and there will be other things they may need to attend to. Let your prospective employee know what app you’ll be using for the call, so they can download it ahead of time, register an account, and test it. Also inform them if you have a contingency plan in case tech issues arise - give them your mobile number, or have a backup video conferencing app ready. Workstream tip: You can also send applicants a primer to help them out, with links to check internet speed, system requirements, or to articles with tips on acing video interviews. You can include links to your company’s website and social media accounts as well, so that they can get a feel for what the company culture and values are like beforehand. For utmost convenience, set up automated messaging to keep applicants apprised regarding schedules and other information. Be considerate Don’t forget to take your applicant’s situation into consideration. There are different factors that can affect the interview from their end, so be more considerate. Offer the chance to do a quick test call prior to the actual interview. This would serve different purposes: get them familiarized with the video call app, test their connection/equipment, and let them work out some of their nerves. Give candidates a bit more time to answer questions, as there could be a bit of delay if their internet connection is slower than yours. Be forgiving of interruptions. A child could come knocking , their pets might make an appearance, a delivery may need to be received. Keep in mind that there are so many possible distractions given that the interview is likely to take place in a home setting. Schedule a quick break in the middle of the interview in case applicants need to get water or take a breather. Keep it human Just because you’re going digital doesn’t mean you can’t give your video interview a human touch. Make sure to maintain eye contact throughout the interview, smile,  and engage in small talk, same as you would in a typical interview. Share a funny anecdote on what the work-from-home experience has been like for you, or ways the company has been taking care of its employees throughout the current crisis. Be mindful of your body language - minimize any fidgeting, nod along if you agree with what candidates are saying, don’t speak with your eyes looking off-screen. Towards the end, give applicants time to ask any questions about the role, expectations, and more. Keep these pointers in mind and you should master the art of conducting video interviews in no time.

And they successfully did, in just a few months. Within this period, most QSRs had already established their own application to make it easier for both old and new customers to make an order from their restaurant. Other modes of orders such as curb pick-up or drive-thru were also available should the customers prefer to do so. With many QSRs jumping onto the digital bandwagon, the need to differentiate themselves from others to provide a better customer experience becomes more important now than ever. And what better way to do so than to create a loyalty program unique to your brand? In this article, we will be exploring some of the ways in which a loyalty program can be advantageous to your business and how you can leverage it to maximize its benefits. Benefits of Loyalty Programs Collection of data The primary benefit of having a loyalty program is the data that you will be privy to. When customers sign up for your program, you will be provided with a wealth of valuable data pertaining to them. This includes their preferences which you can leverage to come up with personalized and relevant offers. Some companies use their customers’ past purchases to send them targeted advertisements, in hopes of having them return to buy more from the restaurant. Others, like Starbucks , treat their customers by gifting them something on their birthdays. These customized specials help them feel a sense of connection with the brand which increases customer satisfaction. Most importantly, collecting your customer data allows you to constantly improve your customer experience as you figure out their ordering habits. Higher Sales and Brand Value According to a report by Paytronix in January 2021, loyalty program members spent more than twice on takeout as compared to those who do not have a membership. And this is understandably so. Loyalty programs typically provide members with an array of special features, from personalized orders to game rewards. Naturally, this will keep customers coming back for more to see what’s in store for them. Even better, this increase in order traffic and customer transaction count will work well in your favor as Wall Street is analyzing these , instead of just taking your sales into account. Needless to say, a loyalty program can potentially place a higher value on your brand. And the bonus? When these programs integrate seamlessly into the workflow of your staff, you don't only get higher sales but a more efficient crew as well. Higher Customer Retention As the name suggests, loyalty programs are rolled out to, well, create more loyal customers for your brand. With businesses getting back up on their feet, the competition in the QSR industry will be stronger now more than ever. Especially as restaurants are scrambling to earn back their losses from the pandemic. Again, loyalty programs provide members with perks that are like no other. As such, this will encourage them to make repeat orders to reap the full benefits of their membership. So, what better way to rise above the rest by retaining your customers through a loyalty program? What’s more, repeat customers spend 67% more than new ones on average. And if you ask us, that itself is a good enough reason for you to start your own loyalty program. Loyal Customers Can Make Great Hires Too While this is not the main point of having a loyalty program, it is possible for you to gain an exceptional employee for your restaurant. Think about it - a loyal customer turned employee. Firstly, you can rest assured that they will work their hardest due to their loyalty to the company. Secondly, they are probably familiar with all the offerings your restaurant has to offer so onboarding them might not be too difficult of a task. Talk about killing two birds with one stone. But if you are looking for ways to hire better, Workstream has the solutions for you. We improve your hiring process with features like smart screening , job board integrations , and more so that you get only the best candidates for your restaurant! Schedule a demo with us today and we’ll let you know how we can best meet your hiring needs. Making It Effective To make a loyalty program effective, you have to ensure that your application interface promotes a good user experience . It is important that you do not make it even more confusing for your customers as this will only deter them from ordering from your restaurant. Additionally, consider adding a few extra features that are accessible only to your loyal customers . This will incentivize them to sign up for your restaurant’s loyalty program. You can also come up with special menus that are only available to the members. Integrating your loyalty program with your marketing strategy is also another way for you to maximize your loyalty program’s benefits. For example, you may choose to build your loyalty program with a social cause . By doing so, you are creating a meaningful program that gives them a stronger sense of connection to the brand. At the same time, you are also letting the wider public know that your brand is a strong advocate for the social cause. While having a loyalty program can bring about numerous benefits, its effectiveness is also dependent on how you utilize it. As it is just a means for you to create a deeper connection between your customers and your brand, merely creating one and expecting it to work magically by itself is not how it works. Instead, ensure that you have the capabilities to analyze and pull insights from the data collected. Only then will you be able to implement changes to improve your customer experience. Summing It Up As you’ve seen above, your restaurant can reap plenty of benefits when you create a loyalty program. Not only will it improve your sales performance but it can also help you continuously improve your service to your customers - something that is very well-valued among them. The key takeaway here? Ensure that you are utilizing your loyalty program the right way as it is not going to work its magic all by itself. Does your restaurant have its own loyalty program? Let us know!

Having a detailed compensation strategy encourages pay equity and builds a great employer brand. If you’re struggling to build a compensation philosophy that fits your business, this article will walk you through all the steps you need to know. What is compensation philosophy? A compensation philosophy is a written statement that organizations can use to organize and understand how compensation works at their company. By producing this document, your business can create a competitive compensation program that pulls highly-qualified talent into your company and keeps them there. Let's go through the steps starting with: 1. Do a deep dive to determine how your organization currently handles compensation One of the first steps to determining how compensation structure will happen at your organization is to deeply dive into how your employees are currently paid. Create a spreadsheet with all of your employees and their: Title Compensation Years of experience Years on the job Benefits Perks Do you notice anything that's wildly misaligned? For example, do certain employees with the same title have drastically different payment structures? Can you explain pay differences based on experience or years at the company? Pay equality (and even pay equity) are important philosophies to uphold if possible. 2. Dive into market research to determine what your competition is offering Next, you want to take some energy to dive into market research. What compensation choices are other companies in your area offering? Try communicating with other managers in your area for intel or looking up reviews about in-area businesses. With a bit of research, you should be able to find where your offerings fit with your competitors. If you don’t want to spend hours researching competitors, there are some companies that offer compensation market analysis that can assist you. 3. Choose a philosophy that works for your organization and employees Once you've done market research and taken a look at the internal pay structure, you need to choose a philosophy that works for you. Here's the bottom line: your business may not be able to sustain the compensation package you want to offer. If you want to create an effective budget, you have to pick a path you can afford. You can try a few different compensation policy options: Market : Pay based on job complexity, qualifications, risk and talent scarcity. Equal : Equal pay across a company regardless of job complexity. Flexible : Using organizational culture and the market to determine rates. Tailored : Using corporate culture, the market and employee performance to determine rates. Besides pay rates, you also want to think about other monetary and non-monetary benefits you can offer like: Work/Life balance Health insurance Bonus programs Vacations Career development opportunities 401(k) matching Free meals Discounts It may be challenging to tie a monetary value to some of these benefits. Still, these benefits can make a huge difference in your employees' lives. 4. Communicate compensation philosophy changes and what that means for current employees After you have made tweaks to the compensation process, you have to consider how these changes will impact current employees. While new hires making more than current hires isn't unheard of (or always bad), it doesn't always bode well for employee retention. If possible, current employees shouldn't be punished for their loyalty to your organization. Make tweaks to ensure that current hires feel compensated appropriately for the long-term contribution to the organization. You can do this in the form of bonuses, pay raises or extra benefits. Whatever you decide to do, make sure that everyone feels good about your decision. 5. Follow-up to ensure that your compensation best practices are still working Once you've set everyone's pay according to your new policies, don't forget to follow up. Take informal feedback as you roll out the new compensation packages. Once employees have spent a few months with their current pay, send out a compensation survey to see where you can tweak and update pay. Does everyone feel like their job is paid well? Is there unnecessary competition between employees with the same job? Do tenured employees feel threatened by how much new employees make? Understanding the answer to these questions can make all the difference when you revisit your compensation strategy at a later date. 4 compensation philosophy examples for inspiration Now that you know the steps to create your compensation procedures, let's cover some examples from popular companies across several industries that are known for their compensation. Are you looking for more QSR examples? Try this article that compares McDonald’s vs. KFC hourly compensation strategies . 1. Buffer Buffer is a marketing technology company that is well-known for being transparent about its salaries. Buffer is a remote team with employees all over the globe. They strive to create fair salaries while taking into account different living situations for employees. Their compensation strategy only considers the role/experience level and cost of living. Buffer's pay policy is basic, but it's effective. Every employee knows that they will be paid in a transparent and fair way. 2. Apple Apple is another organization that takes pay seriously. One crucial part about Apple's pay philosophy is that they don't ask about prior compensation levels. Instead, Apple states, \"our recruiters base offers on Apple employees in similar roles. And every year, we examine the compensation employees receive and ensure that we maintain pay equity.\" This is crucial for employees who are considering getting into technology. Often employees aren't pricing themselves appropriately for roles because they come into technology from another industry. Companies of all sizes can use Apple's approach and avoid asking for prior compensation measures. Giving your employees what you can afford versus what they have the guts to ask for will help employees feel more appreciated. 3. Citi Next on our list is Citi. Citi has a well-thought-out compensation philosophy that connects compensation to retention. In their brief of compensation for shareholders, Citi shares, \"Employee compensation is a critical tool for Citi to attract and retain top talent and successfully execute our corporate goals.\" Without proper compensation, companies won't be able to comfortably staff businesses. We've seen how a lack of compensation has impacted companies during The Great Resignation. Several companies have boosted their pay to attract top talent to restaurants and stores. Companies who want to fully staff their shifts need to focus on providing better compensation. 4. Walmart Last, we'll discuss Walmart's compensation philosophy. According to Walmart, they thrive on creating access to opportunities with hourly pay and incentives , career advancement, and specific help for military veterans and students. Walmart also touts their scheduling stability, health/wellness, family support and education perks. Walmart's policy does a good job of focusing on the additional compensation that the company provides. If you cannot offer a competitive hourly wage, focusing on those other things you can provide makes a world of difference when recruiting new employees. Create a compensation strategy that brings in top talent Pay strategies vary wildly across companies. The best organizations have developed a strategy that helps their employees and their company thrive. Creating your first take on your company's strategy may be challenging. Understanding how much you should pay isn't easy. Hopefully this guide has helped break down some of the barriers as you determine what to pay your team members.

That's what candidate sourcing can feel like. Sifting through heaps of CVs, seeking that ideal candidate for your vacant position. Sure, the right person is out there somewhere... but where? The clock is ticking. Your hiring manager is breathing down your neck and all you have are stacks of maybes and no-ways. You've posted on job boards . Scoured LinkedIn profiles until your eyes crossed. Sent countless InMails with few replies All while wondering: Is this really the best way to source candidates? Let's dive deep into the world of candidate sourcing strategies . We're talking mastering social media outreach , harnessing Boolean search powers and learning how top recruiters build talent pipelines . Understanding the Power of Candidate Sourcing Candidate sourcing , simply put, is a game changer in today's recruitment process . It plays an integral role in determining hiring rates and steering towards a candidate-driven market. But what does it entail? The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides us with some enlightening data that states that sourced candidates account for 24-33% of all hires. Yes, nearly one-third of new hires are sourced candidates. This means your chances are more than doubled when sourcing is part of your strategy. And if we look at job-seeking behavior patterns – only about 36% actively search for new jobs while an astonishingly high percentage (90%) show willingness to learn about new opportunities . The power shift from employers to potential employees couldn't be clearer. A New Era: Embracing the Candidate-Driven Market Gone are the days where job seekers would scramble over each other for limited positions; welcome to the era where companies vie for top talent . Sourced candidates make up such a significant portion because they're often passive - not actively seeking but open to exciting prospects nonetheless. This isn’t mere chance; recruiters deliberately focus their efforts on this group due its higher yield compared with traditional methods. In fact, research indicates that well-executed sourcing strategies can drastically improve hiring success rate by tapping into this hidden pool of potentials. Mastering Your Strategy: Unleashing the Full Potential As appealing as these stats may sound though, achieving them requires mastery over multiple elements like understanding who makes up your ideal talent pool and using appropriate channels and tools to reach them. Remember, in this game of sourcing, precision and relevance are key. Just like you wouldn’t use a net to catch butterflies, job boards might not be your best bet for executive-level candidates. That's where the art and science of candidate sourcing blend together; using data-driven strategies with human intuition to navigate the vast talent ocean. So here’s food for thought: how well-versed are you in harnessing the power of candidate sourcing ? Key Takeaway: Embrace the game changer of candidate sourcing . It doubles your hiring chances and taps into a pool of passive yet open candidates, making up to 33% of all hires. Success lies in knowing your ideal talent pool and using precise tools to reach them. So, how well can you navigate this vast talent ocean? Harnessing Social Media for Effective Candidate Sourcing As the digital landscape continues to evolve, so does the game of candidate sourcing . Today's recruiters are no longer limited to traditional job boards and cold emails; they now have an array of social media platforms at their disposal. Leveraging LinkedIn 's Potential in Candidate Sourcing If you're not utilizing the expansive professional network that LinkedIn has to offer for your recruitment efforts, then you are missing out on a wealth of potential job seekers . It offers advanced search capabilities that allow hiring managers to find qualified talent tailored specifically to their open roles . But it doesn't stop there - using keywords related to job openings can help target both active and passive candidates . This is where mastering Boolean Search comes into play – by combining relevant keywords with operators such as \"AND\", \"OR\" or \"NOT\", this technique can be used effectively within LinkedIn (or any other platform) for precise results. Beyond just finding profiles though, make sure you're building relationships too. By engaging with posts or reaching out directly via InMail, recruiters source candidates who might otherwise remain hidden gems. Finding Candidates Beyond LinkedIn : Facebook & Twitter Moving beyond LinkedIn , let's talk about how Facebook and Twitter can also be valuable tools in your recruiting strategy . These platforms provide unique ways for connecting with potential hires – whether through shared content on company pages ( a great way to showcase employer brand . ) or direct messaging features. The Proactive Search: Both sites offer search functions which give access today's competitive pool of talents when used correctly. Social Sourcing Tools : There are various tools available to optimize your sourcing efforts on these platforms, such as Facebook's Job Board and Twitter's advanced search. Instagram: A New Frontier in Candidate Sourcing ? Finally, we can't overlook Instagram. Boasting a billion users globally, this visually-focused platform is growing in popularity for social sourcing . It might seem offbeat compared to LinkedIn or Indeed , but many recruiters have struck gold by tapping into it. Key Takeaway: Master the digital game of candidate sourcing by using social media platforms . LinkedIn 's advanced search, Boolean Search techniques, and InMail can help you find hidden talent. Facebook and Twitter offer unique ways to connect with potential hires while tools like Facebook's Job Board enhance your efforts. Don't overlook Instagram as an emerging platform for finding candidates. Unleashing the Power of Boolean Search in Candidate Sourcing Boolean search can be a game-changer and this method allows recruiters to combine keywords and operators for more relevant results. Making the Most Out Of Your Search To make full use of this technique, understanding its basic components is crucial. In a nutshell, you have three key operators: 'AND', 'OR', and 'NOT'. 'AND' lets you find profiles containing all specified terms. For example, \"Software AND Developer\" will fetch those who hold both these skills or experiences. The operator ‘OR’ helps widen your net by fetching profiles with either term. If you're looking for people skilled in Python or Java – “Python OR Java” does just that. The third operator - ‘NOT’, excludes certain words from your search results. So if you want developers but not front-end ones? You'd go for \"Developer NOT Front-End\". Beyond using these alone, they can be combined to form even more powerful queries. Let's say we need software developers experienced in Python but not front-end development; our query becomes “Software AND Developer AND Python NOT Front-End”. Sure sounds fun once we get the hang of it. And hey - don't forget those quotation marks when searching multi-word phrases; else things might go awry. This approach empowers recruiters by enabling targeted searches that yield high-quality potential candidates much faster than traditional methods would allow. We should note though - mastering Boolean requires practice and patience as precision plays an essential role. A minor slip-up could lead to a completely different set of profiles, or even none at all. So why not start experimenting today? It's about time we leveraged the full power of Boolean search in recruitment. Happy hunting. I'm sorry, but without further information on the topic I cannot provide a rephrased version. Could you give more info? Key Takeaway: Power up your candidate sourcing with Boolean search. Understand and use 'AND', 'OR', and 'NOT' to hone in on the best talent . But remember, precision is key - a minor slip could alter results. So start practicing today for more targeted searches and faster high-quality hires. Mastering the Art of Sourcing Passive Candidates The art of sourcing passive candidates can seem like a complex puzzle, but with personalized communication and effective networking strategies, you can make strides in reaching these hidden gems. Remember that only 36% of candidates actively look for new jobs while an astounding 90% are open to exploring fresh opportunities. Finding passive talent requires more than just broadcasting your job openings on traditional job boards or social media platforms . It's about making connections through mutual acquaintances, attending industry-specific meetups or webinars where you could potentially find suitable candidates. This approach is not just beneficial; it's essential given today's competitive talent marketplace. A key aspect here involves building relationships with potential hires before there’s even an open role at your company. You don't always need to have a current opening to start forming meaningful professional relationships. Tapping into Personalized Communication In this digital age, it may be tempting to blast out automated messages hoping one will land on the right candidate . But remember that personalization goes a long way in capturing attention and fostering trust - two critical elements when sourcing passive candidates . To master personalized communication means taking time to research prospective talents thoroughly before contacting them – understand their skills set and career aspirations from information available online such as LinkedIn profiles or other relevant publications they might have contributed towards. A good rule of thumb? Tailor every outreach message so that each recipient feels valued for their unique skill sets rather than being another nameless face among hundreds reached out daily by recruiters everywhere around the globe. Leveraging Networking Strategies An important part of mastering candidate sourcing lies in leveraging effective networking strategies: attend industry events, join forums related to your field (such as those found on Meetup ), and engage in online discussions. By expanding your network, you can expand the scope of potential candidates . When you're networking, LinkedIn can be a great tool for building professional connections. But don't overlook other platforms like Twitter or Instagram where potential candidates might pop up. Key Takeaway: Cracking the code of sourcing passive candidates takes personalized outreach and savvy networking. It's not just about posting jobs but forming connections even before a role is open. Personalized communication helps build trust, so take time to know potential talents ' skills and aspirations. Meanwhile, effective networking strategies expand your talent pool —attend industry events, join relevant forums, and engage online. Time Investment in Candidate Sourcing It's not about how fast you can get a candidate, but rather the quality of candidates you bring to your talent pipeline . Just like nurturing plants, sourcing candidates needs time and patience. A crucial aspect that many hiring managers overlook is the amount of time needed for effective candidate sourcing . It might seem efficient to rush through this process with an aim to fill job openings as quickly as possible, but rushing often leads us down a road filled with missed opportunities and less than ideal fits. The Risks of Rushing Recruitment Rushing recruitment is like eating unripe fruit - it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. You may end up asking for resumes before even conducting a phone screen which could raise red flags among potential candidates . Why? Because it suggests that you're more interested in filling positions quickly than finding the right fit. If we turn our attention towards data provided by Glassdoor , they recommend spending at least 30 minutes per week on sourcing activities depending on the position being recruited for. This shows that even if there's pressure from above or within ourselves to speed things up, slow and steady does indeed win the race when it comes to recruiting top talent . Beyond just timing though, let's also think about efficiency in recruitment – another vital component influenced by rushing processes unnecessarily. Think back again: would you prefer biting into ripe juicy fruit or something half-baked? Similarly having more structured timelines allows us space not only focus on quantity (i.e., numbers) but also quality i.e., selecting highly qualified individuals who are likely contribute significantly their respective roles & organizations overall performance. In essence don't sacrifice long-term success short term gains because remember – Rome wasn't built day. Rather than pressuring your recruitment team to rush through the sourcing process, it may be worth considering if such haste is really necessary. The right candidate could be just around the corner if only we give ourselves enough time and patience to discover them. Key Takeaway: Don't rush your recruitment process . Just like nurturing plants, finding quality candidates needs time and patience. Avoid shortcuts that sacrifice long-term success for short term gains. Invest at least 30 minutes per week in sourcing activities to find the right fit. Remember, slow and steady wins the race. Social Media Platforms : Websites such as LinkedIn , Facebook, and Twitter are not just for connecting with friends anymore; they've become valuable sources for finding potential candidates too. With their advanced search capabilities and vast user bases, it’s easier than ever to source both active and passive candidates from these sites. Candidate Relationship Management ( CRM ) This system tracks interactions with past applicants or prospective employees who haven’t yet applied but might be suitable future hires — essentially building up your own talent pool . A robust CRM software makes sure no potential hire falls through the cracks while also helping build relationships by providing timely responses using automated emails or messages. Talent Pipelines Mastering candidate sourcing gives recruiting teams an advantage in today's competitive talent marketplace. The technology can help create a pipeline of candidates by storing and organizing potential hires’ information for future openings. This way, when a new job opening arises, you have already sourced some potentially qualified candidates to reach out to immediately. Tools for Sourcing: Key Takeaway: Embrace tech in your hiring process . Use job boards and social media to find potential hires, analyze post performance with tracking systems, and make the most of Boolean searches for precise results. Don't forget CRM software - it's key for building relationships and ensuring no prospect is overlooked. Finally, use technology to build a talent pipeline ready for future opportunities. Building an Effective Talent Pipeline through Strategic Sourcing In today's competitive talent marketplace, building a robust talent pipeline can give your recruiting team a serious advantage. Mastering candidate sourcing is the key to this success. Strategic sourcing involves proactively searching for potential candidates rather than waiting for job seekers to find and apply for your open positions . This approach helps you build relationships with qualified candidates and nurture them until they're ready to step into an open role in your company. A solid networking strategy , whether online or offline , is crucial in strategic sourcing. Networking lets you tap into passive candidates - those not actively seeking new opportunities but are open if something interesting comes along. Remember that only 36% of individuals are active job seekers ; the remaining majority forms our untapped pool of passive candidates . Leveraging Social Media & Job Boards The power of social media cannot be overlooked when it comes to candidate sourcing . Platforms like LinkedIn offer vast professional networks that recruiters can use effectively for their sourcing efforts . Social platforms help increase visibility about your employer brand while letting you connect directly with potential hires, both active and passive ones alike. And let's not forget traditional job boards which still remain effective tools in any recruiter’s arsenal. Tapping Into Employee Referrals An often-underestimated source of top-notch applicants? Your existing employees. A well-executed employee referral program encourages current staff members to recommend talented individuals from their own network—people who might make excellent additions to your team. This method brings higher-quality leads because people usually refer folks they believe will fit right into the work culture—and succeed at their jobs too. Using Technology to Enhance Sourcing Last but not least, technology platforms like Lever provide powerful tools and resources that can streamline your sourcing process. Lever’s comprehensive suite helps recruiters manage their talent pipelines effectively while making the overall hiring process more efficient. Key Takeaway: Mastering candidate sourcing is key to building a robust talent pipeline in today's competitive market. It involves proactive search, relationship-building with potential hires, and nurturing them for future roles. Harness the power of social media , job boards , employee referrals, and technology like Lever to source both active and passive candidates effectively.

And those missed opportunities can have big implications for your business growth. In this post, we’ll explore how building brand awareness attracts potential candidates and how screening techniques weed out those who aren’t quite right. We'll also delve into interviewing strategies that help you pinpoint top talent from among dozens or even hundreds of applicants. But don't worry! With these insights in hand, mastering the hiring funnel won’t feel as tricky as catching butterflies. Understanding the Hiring Funnel An overview of what a hiring funnel is, its stages, and how it serves as a framework for the recruitment process . Defining the Hiring Funnel A deeper look into what constitutes a hiring or recruitment funnel and its significance in talent acquisition . The hiring funnel serves as a critical framework for your recruitment process . It's a series of stages, each narrowing down potential candidates to help you find the best fit for open positions . A statistic from Small Business Trends shows that most companies take two to three months moving applicants from application stage to hire. This fact underscores the importance of having an efficient hiring funnel in place. The journey starts with attracting talent through job boards and ends at offer acceptance. Each step—awareness, consideration, intent, evaluation—is essential in ensuring successful hires. And remember, no matter how well-crafted your job descriptions are or how attractive your brand seems if your recruiting process isn't smooth and streamlined you may lose valuable prospects along the way. The Importance of Brand Awareness in the Hiring Process When it comes to recruiting top-notch talent, your employer brand can be a deal-breaker. In fact, 75% of job seekers consider an employer's brand before applying for a role. This means that establishing and maintaining a strong brand awareness is no longer optional; it’s crucial for successful recruitment marketing . Your organization needs to give potential candidates the right impression from the get-go. Building Employer Branding A solid employer brand isn't built overnight but with consistency and authenticity, you can attract quality candidates who align with your company culture and values. Remember that most applicants aren’t just looking at what you do but also how you do it - so make sure your actions reflect your words. Your website plays an instrumental role in shaping these impressions – more than half (53%) of candidates get information about their prospective employers there. Attracting Potential Candidates Finding potential candidates can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack. But with the right strategies, it doesn't have to be that hard. Firstly, social media isn't just for sharing memes and cat videos anymore; it's also an effective tool for attracting potential candidates . Platforms such as LinkedIn or Facebook allow you to reach out directly to talent pools and can drastically reduce time to hire . Job boards are another resource at your disposal. They're not only where most people apply for jobs but they also give your open position exposure to a wider audience. Last but definitely not least is crafting compelling job descriptions . A well-written job description attracts qualified applicants by giving them clear expectations of what the role entails and how their skills fit into it. Remember: It’s about making the candidate see themselves in that role before they even apply. Most job applications have a completion rate of only 10.6%. That means almost 90% don’t finish applying. Ensure your application process is straightforward and user-friendly. Screening and Selecting Candidates The task of screening the best candidates is an integral part of the hiring funnel . This step lets you filter out those who may not fit your open position 's requirements, allowing for a more efficient recruitment process . It all starts with reviewing applications to find qualified applicants. During this stage, you might look at resumes , cover letters, or even recorded video submissions from potential hires. The Role of Background Checks A crucial component in screening is conducting background checks. This practice provides further insight into each candidate’s history that isn't readily apparent in their application materials. Background checks help confirm information provided by candidates and uncover any possible red flags such as criminal records or falsified credentials. It's essential to observe that background checks must be done carefully, in agreement with laws protecting privacy and principles of equity. Interviewing and Assessing Candidates Hiring managers have a tough job. Not only do they need to attract top talent , but they also must assess candidates based on specific job requirements . The process can be daunting. A crucial part of the hiring funnel involves spending hours each week interviewing potential hires. In fact, for small businesses, this task alone could take up to seven hours. It's a significant investment in time that emphasizes the importance of having an effective recruitment strategy. When assessing candidates during interviews, it’s important not just to focus on their skills and qualifications but also whether or not they’d be a good fit for your company culture. This is why most successful companies conduct at least three rounds of interviews as a benchmark - more opportunities mean more chances to make sure you’re getting the right person for your team. Making Job Offers It's time to make an offer, the final step in your hiring funnel . Before you present the job offer , think about some points. Negotiating Terms Negotiation is more than just deciding on salary; it includes other factors like benefits and work hours. It’s not always about money - sometimes flexible working conditions can be the deal breaker for potential hires. Remember this: Compensation matters but may not guarantee acceptance of your job offer . Be ready to negotiate terms beyond just compensation to secure candidate acceptance. A good fit between employee expectations and what you're willing to give can drastically improve your offer acceptance rate . This isn't easy – making offers is often a balancing act where both parties need satisfaction. So put on your negotiation hat and let's get started. Improving the Hiring Funnel The hiring funnel can seem like a never-ending rollercoaster ride. But, don't worry. We're here to help you turn it into a smooth sail. The Role of Referrals in Recruitment Candidate referrals are one of the most potent tools in your recruiting efforts arsenal. Not only do they increase conversion rates but also create an environment where everyone's involved in talent acquisition . A well-oiled referral program can be compared to a turbo-charged sports car; it'll get you from A ( open position ) to B (filled role) faster than other methods. Studies show that referred candidates have higher acceptance rates and stay longer at companies, proving their worth as a core element of recruitment strategies. So, buckle up and let your employees drive your company towards success. Measuring and Analyzing the Hiring Funnel The hiring funnel , like any other business process, needs to be measured and analyzed. It's not enough just to have a hiring funnel ; you must comprehend its performance. You measure a hiring funnel by looking at various metrics throughout its stages. These include measures such as the number of applicants that enter your funnel (funnel metric ), how many progress through each stage (applicant tracking), and finally, those who accept job offers (measure offers). Each of these steps provides vital data points for understanding your organization’s hiring effectiveness. By analyzing these numbers over time, you can pinpoint where candidates are falling out of your process or where bottlenecks occur. Small Business Statistics shows it generally takes two to three months for most companies to move candidates from the application stage to hire. That might seem long but remember: effective recruitment isn't about speed—it's about finding the right fit. Enhancing the Candidate Experience Crafting a memorable candidate experience isn't just about being nice - it's also key to attracting and retaining top talent . After all, candidates are people too. A well-crafted job description can make all the difference in setting expectations right from the start. It lets potential applicants know what they're signing up for, helping them visualize their role within your organization. To truly stand out though, consider taking things one step further by incorporating recorded video interviews into your recruitment process . Video interviews provide a more individualized approach and enable job seekers to demonstrate their character beyond the content of their resumes . Remember: every interaction counts. So whether you're communicating via email or over the phone, always aim for clear and timely communication that respects each individual’s time. Optimizing the Hiring Funnel for Small Businesses When it comes to hiring, small businesses face unique challenges. With limited resources and a smaller talent pool, making the most out of every stage in the recruitment funnel is essential. The first step? Crafting an attractive job description that appeals to both internal and external applicants. This doesn't just mean listing skills or qualifications - a well-written job description should paint a picture of what working at your company looks like and why potential candidates would want to join. A great tip is focusing on highlighting opportunities for growth within open positions – this attracts ambitious individuals who are looking not only for employment but also professional development. Beyond attracting candidates, small businesses must work hard to retain them through effective screening processes , creating an appealing employer brand , fostering employee referrals , and ensuring smooth onboarding procedures. FAQs in Relation to Hiring Funnel What is a hiring funnel ? A hiring funnel is a framework used in recruitment to streamline the process from attracting potential candidates to making job offers . How do you create a hiring funnel ? To craft your own hiring funnel , start by defining the stages of recruitment, like attraction, screening, interviewing, and offer extension. Then optimize each stage for efficiency. What does top of the funnel mean in recruiting? The ' top of the funnel ' refers to initial recruitment phases where efforts focus on building brand awareness and pulling in potential applicants. How do I create a recruitment funnel in Excel? In Excel, lay out your stages vertically (like application received, interview scheduled), then log candidate progress horizontally across these stages. This way you can track them easily. Conclusion Mastering your hiring funnel is no longer a daunting task. You now understand its significance in the recruitment process and have grasped key strategies for attracting potential candidates . Your employer branding is more than just an image, it’s a magnet that draws top talent towards you. Remember, crafting well-written job descriptions will keep application drop rates low. The importance of screening can't be overstated either. Background checks are essential to ensure you're bringing aboard the right people. And when it comes time to make job offers ? Skillful negotiation could seal the deal with your ideal candidate acceptance rate soaring high!

Some opportunities may boast a more recognizable company name or more attractive pay. There are lots of free job posting sites to utilize so it's important to learn how to elevate your job ads and rise above the noise. Designing an engaging job description is not easy, but it's an important part of any successful recruitment strategy . A hefty dose of creativity and careful messaging are necessary to make your job postings stand out on job boards and make your careers page be heavily frequented. It's not an easy task, but with a little extra effort, you can attract the right candidates and inspire them to apply to your job opportunities . Many creative job postings have been created over the years. In this article, we take a deep dive into eight creative tips that we picked up from some of the best job postings we’ve found online. 8 job posting examples to emulate 1. Be personal Company: Taco Bell Why it’s great: It’s rare to find job postings that speak this directly to an applicant. This posting on Facebook shows an appreciation for each candidate and their unique characteristics. This not only leaves your prospective candidates curious but also makes the post feel more open-minded to its people. This is a great use of an online platform to reach out to qualified candidates . Key takeaway: Speak directly to the applicant and make them feel special. 2. Proudly embrace your company culture Company: McDonald’s Why it’s great: This job posting on Facebook is for the job title of an Operations Associate in Nebraska. McDonald’s clearly embraces their company culture right at the start with the second paragraph of the posting: “At McDonald’s , we see every day as a chance to create a positive impact. We lead through our values centered on inclusivity, service, integrity, community and family. From support of Ronald McDonald House Charities to our Youth Opportunity project and sustainability initiatives , our values keep us dedicated to using our scale for good: good for our customers, people, industry and planet.” McDonald’s is making clear what the company culture and values are all about. Applicants appreciate seeing a company that is passionate about making a difference in the community and the world. Key tkkeaway: Show off your company culture in your job advertisement and be true to your brand voice. 3. Be clear and specific Company: Chick-fil-A Why it’s great: This job posting on LinkedIn is for a Front of House Director for a Chik-fil-A restaurant in Ohio. The post does an excellent job of clearly explaining exactly what it will take to succeed in this open position : “We are looking for a self-directed leader with a growth mindset and hunger to take ownership of the front of house and create a strong vision for Chick-fil-A Reynoldsburg. First, this leader will learn all aspects of Chick-fil-A, so he/she can understand each facet of the business and begin to think strategically for the front of house. This leader must have high emotional intelligence, the ability to build strong relationships, grit, energy, attention to detail, and a strong passion to see the business succeed.” The post also gives potential candidates a clear idea of what the job will entail from day one. Key takeaway: Candidates do not like generic job post templates . Your post should describe the specific role in detail and give the candidate a clear understanding of what to expect in the job. 4. Be unconventional Company: Burger King Why it’s great: Burger King made a short video they shared on Facebook and Instagram which promotes the benefits and perks of being a part of the Burger King team. With the current hiring shortages facing quick-service restaurants (QSRs), it’s more important than ever to promote the benefits you offer your workers during the recruitment process . Usually, these benefits are listed in bullet point format on a job posting . Burger King thought outside the box with this unconventional video, which they shared on social media to help attract new applicants. Key takeaway: Find new ways to attract applicants and lean into your employer brand . Use videos on social media to spread your message. 5. Be concise Company: Kentucky Fried Chicken Why it’s great: The reality is most job seekers have limited attention spans. You have to make the most of a small amount of space to get your message across. Kentucky Fried Chicken recently did a great job of being concise in a job posting on Indeed. The entire posting was only five short paragraphs. However, KFC was able to get the key information about the position across in their post. This brevity increased KFC’s chances of getting a response from the posting because applicants weren’t overwhelmed by too much information. Key takeaway: Find a balance between being concise and still including key information about the role. 6. Be visually appealing Company: Jack in the Box Why it’s great: The words that you use in your job postings are obviously important. However, the visual aspects of your postings are important as well. The visual aesthetics of your post help draw the reader in and build a sense of curiosity. Recently Jack in the Box posted on Facebook an image that helped capture candidates’ imaginations about their future career goals. This image not only draws candidates in but also shows them that Jack in the Box cares about their future goals. Candidates want to work with teams that will help take them to the next level in their careers. Key takeaway: Use visual aesthetics—and words—to draw more candidates into your application process . 7. Be positive Company: Zaxby’s Why it’s great: It may sound obvious, but creative job postings should also be positive. Unfortunately, this is not always the case in QSR job postings . Sometimes hiring managers that are overworked and overstressed can be less than positive in job postings and make allusions to the challenges that await the candidate. This approach of course seldom works well, and when it does, it tends not to attract the ideal candidate . The best talent is looking for a positive team environment. Zaxby’s did a great job of this recently in a Facebook job post . The post featured a local team smiling and having fun. The words of the post emphasized how fun it can be to work with people you enjoy. Zaxby’s is doing a great job in this post of promoting a positive vibe that is attractive to top talent . Key takeaway: Above all, be positive and never negative. 8. Make compensation easy to see Company: Culver’s Why it’s great: Let’s face it, compensation is one of the top reasons applicants are interested in joining your team. In a recent job posting on LinkedIn , Culver’s made it very easy for candidates to understand the compensation associated with the role. This is not always the case for QSR job postings . Sometimes, the hourly pay range or annual salary is buried within the paragraphs of the post. Follow Culver’s example and make the compensation very easy for candidates to see. Key takeaway: Make the compensation rate very easy for candidates to find in the job post . Take the time to write creative job postings If you're struggling with filling positions, consider taking cues from some of these fun job ad examples we’ve found.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 09/14/23 3 Steps to Finding and Bringing in the Best Hourly Employees Share this article Managers responsible for recruiting hourly workers typically do a good job of bringing in candidates and keeping them long enough to recoup their hiring costs. Unfortunately, not much is gained after the initial employment honeymoon is over. In fact, high turnover rates seen in the hourly workforce may impact a company more negatively than we would expect. The hourly worker turnover rates are the highest in the industry, with the rates soaring as high as 160% . With such frequently published rates announced through media outlets, it's understandable why some employers are unbothered by their own high turnover rates. After all, the numbers are pretty much the same in every other industry. So why not just deal with it, right? Well, that is one way to look at it. But what if there was a better way of finding good employees and keeping them longer than the average time period? What if we could skew the statistics to work in our favor? The good news is we can make a positive change simply by going back to the basics - knowing who to look for, knowing where to look and lastly, screening and assessing your candidates properly. Read on to find out how these three simple steps can help you improve the hourly employee turnover rate in your company. Step 1: Know Who To Look For We often fall into the trap of assuming what a job entails and what a candidate should be able to do to excel in that position. While this may seem harmless, such assumptions could be detrimental to a company’s operations. That is why an in-depth job analysis should be performed every year or so to make sure that the details in the job description are accurate to the tee. What’s more, the process does not take very long and is well worth the effort. The best way to perform the job analysis is to observe the employee working and obtain feedback from the employee, the manager or supervisor, other employees and customers. It is important not to leave any tasks or skills required in the job out of the analysis. In the process, you may want to take note of the CAPS of the job or Capacities : the physical and mental requirements to do the job; Attitudes : customer service needs, dependability, etc.; Personality : the traits needed such as temperament and assertiveness; and Skills : what is required to perform well on the job. After the analysis, you can then put together a job description based on your observations and the inputs you have received. Ensure that you include all of the requirements needed. This not only helps the candidate understand the position but also protects your company in the long run should an employee decide to file a complaint against you or the company. Step 2: Know Where To Look To effectively find the right candidates for the job, place your job posting somewhere highly visible and accessible to job-seekers. You want to look for individuals who meet the prerequisites of the job based on your previous job analysis. Studies show that advertisements are the second-best way to find good candidates, after referrals. If your company depends on hourly employees, your efforts should be focused on a consistent and constant form of marketing for candidates. Be very creative with your ads. If you find that your potential candidates are avid users of social media, place an advertisement on Facebook or utilize Instagram to generate leads. At Workstream , you can post your job advertisement to 25,000 different job boards in just a single click, improving your chances of finding a quality candidate. Through data-driven analytics, we help you identify where your applicants are coming from and which applicant source provides candidates with higher retention rates. This helps you reduce expenses in areas that do not bring much returns. Ultimately, the idea is to recognize where your qualified candidates are and saturate their environments with your message of hiring. At the same time, you may want to promote the impressive culture in your company. Find out how you can optimize your job post with our article - ‘ 11 Tips for Writing a Job Post that Grabs Attention ’. Step 3: Screen and Assess Your Candidates A pre-screening stage allows you to get to know your applicants better before scheduling a proper interview with them. At this stage, consider utilizing questionnaires that allow you to assess a candidate’s personality and aptitude for the job. This allows you to narrow down your candidate pool so that only the best are shortlisted. As with every other hourly position, be sure to ask for their availability so that you will know whether the working hours of the job match the candidates’ available timing. There are a few Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) in the market which help you screen your applicants so that you do not have to go through each and every resume you receive. At Workstream, we even allow you to customize your screening questions so that you are not limited to a set of assessments for your potential candidates. After the pre-screening is done, ensure that you plan out your interview questions in advance. This allows you to better assess your candidates and know what to look out for in their answers. Consider including behavioral questions in your interviews so that you are able to determine how they will react in different situations, and whether their behaviors are what you look for in your employee. Behavioral questions differ depending on the nature of the job. Check out our Ultimate Guide to Interviewing Candidates Using Behavioral Questions to find out how you can make the best out of them! Begin Today A high employee turnover rate can cost more harm than good to your company as it comes with an increase in unnecessary hiring costs.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 01/14/22 Pay transparency laws and what it means for restaurants Share this article Do you remember the advice you got early in your career? The one that encouraged you to never ask what the job you’re interviewing for pays? Well, that advice is slowly becoming obsolete. Recently, NYC passed a law changing how pay rates are revealed to job seekers. The new law states that when employers’ posts job openings, the pay rate must also be listed alongside job requirements and duties. Why was the salary transparency law imposed? The NYC law is set to go into effect in April 2022. The aim for these laws, even though they differ some from state to state , is largely to reduce wage disparities for women and minorities. Women and minorities have been, on average, paid lower wages compared to male and white counterparts. According to the Economic Policy Institute, women on average make 22.6% less than men with the same education in the same role. And women who wait on tables in restaurants also make 12% less than their male coworkers. Plus, from findings of another report done by the Economic Policy Institute, black workers make up about 1 in 6 of all the workforce in front line industries, including service workers and are paid roughly 26.6% less than their counterparts. The New York City Council passed the bill in December, joining Colorado and California that both recently passed the law stating that wage ranges need to be part of the job ad. Some states, such as Maryland and Washington, and some cities in Ohio, like Toledo and Cincinnati, have already had these requirements in place, helping improve the gap in wages and create equitable work conditions. What does wage transparency mean for employers? The first thing to understand here is that if you’re not already sharing wages in your job posting, you’ll most likely need to do so in the near future. California and NYC give insight on what’s to come down the road—and across the nation. The laws ban employers from using the applicants’ salary history when determining what to pay them. For example, say that an applicant was being paid $10/hour at previous jobs, but the job you might be offering them is slated to pay $15/hour. In this scenario, you could not ask about their previous compensation (or use this information, if learned) to offer a lower range because of their history. Second, the laws grant applicants and current employees the right to access a company’s pay range for a particular job. Hence, if employee A wanted to know what employee B was making for the same job, they can do so. Additionally, an applicant can ask that taboo question: “What does this company normally pay for this role?” Why is salary transparency beneficial for employees (and employers)? Listing wage ranges on your job openings is a great way to help potential candidates find you and determine if the job is right for them. Many job boards today allow people to filter roles by their pay requirements. This, of course, cuts down the amount of time potential applicants spend looking for roles that align with their needs (and yours). Pay transparency also removes the stress of negotiating pay once the job is offered. And for those people who don’t negotiate? Well, those who are likely to accept the wage they were initially offered—who didn’t ask for more—may develop a sense of resentfulness once they learn they could have been earning more. And with transparency of salary, current employees will find more job satisfaction. When they don’t have to wonder if their coworker who is performing the same duties is making more than they are, they’ll be better supported to focus on their responsibilities and the customer experience. How can employers use pay transparency to their advantage? At first, you might think you are losing your advantage in the hiring process if you already have all your cards on the table when it comes to wage negotiation. But that won’t be the entire case. True, there is a chance you will pay out more than before, but there will be advantages you have to consider. In the tight labor market, having the pay wages listed on your job ads will attract more qualified employees. You will save time with your hiring process as only those who are looking for the wages you are listing will apply. Remember, a lot of time is wasted with the application and interviewing process when the candidate looks at the pay and says they were looking for more. And if you were wondering what your competitor down the road was paying their employees, a simple search of their job listings will give you all the information you need to be competitive. And if you’re advertising competitive wages on your job ads, you’ll also be boosting your employer brand. It can also help you hold on to employees during the labor shortage. With wage transparency, a current employee who might have considered leaving your restaurant due to uncertainty of whether they were being paid fairly will more likely stay with your organization, confident they are doing just as well as their coworkers. Final thought Hiding what the pay range of an open position on a job ad was always troublesome for potential candidates. Posting the range so everyone can see it and make educated decisions on whether to apply or not benefits everyone, saving hiring time and closing the pay gap to those who normally were offered less compensation for the same quality of work.

You’ve probably heard of LinkedIn, but did you know it can be an effective tool for job postings? Join us as we discuss the basics of posting a job on LinkedIn and how it can help you reach potential hires. Overview of LinkedIn Job Postings The LinkedIn social media platform allows professionals, recruiters, and companies to connect with others and build relationships. As such, it has become an effective tool for finding qualified candidates and posting job openings. LinkedIn job postings usually include the job title, description, salary range, location, and contact details of the recruiter. Importance of Using LinkedIn for Job Postings Using LinkedIn for job postings has several advantages: It allows employers to access an enormous pool of potential candidates, as millions of users on the platform are from different backgrounds and locations. It also helps refine search results as employers can filter the right candidates based on skills, relevant experience, or qualifications they may look for in prospective employees. It reduces costs associated with traditional job boards as most postings are free or low-cost on LinkedIn. Setting up a LinkedIn Job Posting Setting up a job post on LinkedIn can be done in just a few steps. Here’s what you need to do: 1. Create a company page A company page is an easy way to set up your profile and present your brand on LinkedIn. You can also use this page to manage job postings, add a drop-down menu for job categories, assess applicants, and have access to free job posts. 2. Choose the right job posting package Different packages are available depending on the duration of your post, budget constraints, or whether you’re looking for candidates locally or internationally. 3. Write an effective job description When writing a job description, focus on the qualifications you’re looking for in prospective employees, such as their experience and skill set. Make sure that it is also tailored to the type of position being advertised, as this will make it easier for potential candidates to find your listing from the homepage or other searches they may be doing on LinkedIn. Understanding the Recruiter Perspective LinkedIn’s recruiter tool provides recruiters with various options to enhance their outreach and increase engagement with job postings. Here are some tips on how to make the most out of this feature: 1. Analyzing LinkedIn's Recruiter Tool The recruiter tool allows employers to choose from a drop-down menu of different hiring processes, such as hourly pay, full-time, part-time, job location, etc. This helps them narrow down suitable candidates for their job ads. 2. Enhancing Recruiter Outreach through LinkedIn LinkedIn lets you create job posts and enables employers to manage job postings and track responses received in real time. This helps recruiters create an efficient pipeline of potential hires, which can be used for future job postings. 3. Increasing Recruiter Engagement with LinkedIn Job Postings Employers can use LinkedIn insights to understand the interests of prospective hires and customize job descriptions according to their needs. This information helps recruiters engage more effectively with their target audience and increases the chances of getting conversions from the job posting. LinkedIn vs. Other Job Boards Regarding job postings, there are many factors to consider when deciding which platform to use. Here’s a comparison between LinkedIn and traditional job boards: Total Budget Traditional job boards charge per posting, whereas LinkedIn uses pay-per-click or total budget plan pricing. This advantage makes LinkedIn more flexible for small businesses that may not have the funds to invest in expensive job listings. Professional Network Having a LinkedIn page dedicated to your business is a great way to promote yourself and show potential candidates your professionalism. Additionally, since it is already a social media platform, you can reach out directly to influencers or post about open positions on your page wall. Potential Candidates With its extensive professional network, LinkedIn allows employers to find the best candidates for their open positions regardless of location or industry type. This is an excellent way for employers to target specific professionals when considering different candidates for their vacancies. Tips for Writing an Effective LinkedIn Job Posting Posting jobs on LinkedIn requires a few steps to ensure they reach the right audience. Here are some tips to make sure your job postings are effective: 1. Use relevant keywords in your job description Using relevant keywords helps potential candidates find your post more easily when searching for jobs using LinkedIn’s search engine. Find keywords by looking at similar job postings or search terms related to the position you’re hiring for. 2. Utilize LinkedIn's pay-per-click feature If you’re looking for the best candidates, LinkedIn offers a pay-per-click job ad feature. This feature allows employers to target their job listings to specific demographics, making it easier for potential candidates to find the listing. 3. Leverage the power of LinkedIn for small businesses Small businesses can effectively use LinkedIn to promote job postings and reach potential candidates. Utilize the platform’s networking tools to connect with potential job seekers, such as alumni of your school or local business owners. Concluding thoughts LinkedIn is an invaluable resource for employers looking to hire the best candidates. Its extensive professional network allows recruiters to target specific audiences and customize job descriptions according to their needs. Additionally, LinkedIn offers a pay-per-click feature that makes it easier for small businesses with limited budgets to post effective job postings.

If you want to hire in today’s competitive landscape, you need to use Indeed —and optimize each of your job postings within it. Before we dive deeper, let’s cover a few things around Indeed costs to help you get started with Indeed . Indeed plans How much is Indeed for employers? Well, Indeed offers a variety of plans to help hiring managers meet their specific hiring needs . With Indeed , you have access to tools that can help you improve the visibility of your job listings . With Indeed for employers, you can opt for sponsored listings, which give your job openings premium positions in the job search results. You might be wondering how much Indeed plans cost and what each plan includes. Indeed Resume plan With Indeed for employers, you can conduct unlimited resume searches under the Indeed Resume Plan. Employers pay $15 per prospective candidate they contact. This option is perfect for hiring managers who work in industries with low turnover rates. Indeed Standard and Indeed Professional Standard Subscriptions Many employers choose a subscription to get more value out of Indeed . The Standard Subscription Fee ($100/month) allows you to contact up to 30 candidates, and the Professional Standard ($250/month/user) allows up to 100 candidates.

The cost of this Indeed Sponsored job listing is $0.20 - $1.20 per click so this could be more friendly on the daily budget . Indeed Simple Plan The question how much is Indeed definitely changes depending on what you want. There's the Indeed Simple Plan, which allows employers to specify how much they are willing to spend daily or monthly for each job posting . How to post a job listing on Indeed Go to Indeed .com and create a free employer account using your company email Add details about your job posting Fill out the application questions Review and publish the job posting Add your account information Select \" Sponsor job \" or \"Post job without sponsoring\" to the right of \"Continue\" Tips to get the best results out of your Indeed job posting Writing a highly detailed and professional job posting helps attract qualified applicants. When writing a job posting , there are three key points to focus on: job title , job description , and applicant qualifications. Job title The job title should be specific and short (keep it under 80 characters) so it’s easy for job seekers to spot a role that they’re suited for. While the title should be brief enough to convey what the position is, it should also be creative. After all, this top-line real estate is your chance to help catch a job seeker ’s attention—and stand out above all the other job postings they might see. Take an assessment of the job titles that appear when you search for similar roles. Do they include certain terms? Do they mention salary? Do they include emojis? See what your competitors are doing, not so you can copy them but rather so you can learn what’s working. From there, add your brand twist to it so you can stand out and, ultimately, win more applicants. Here are a few examples of what a stand-out title could look like: Restaurant General Manager Chicago—Never Work Sundays Team Member—Daily Pay Available with Instant Pay! Crew Member Evening Shift—$18/hr Job description Job descriptions should be engaging, easy to read, and include terms related to the role and industry. This is an opportunity for you to sell the potential applicant on why they should work for you. Take this time to clearly and concisely outline not only the job responsibilities (shift hours, daily duties, etc.) and qualifications (experience, language proficiency, etc.), but also to highlight the benefits you offer and your restaurant’s culture. This can also include business values and mission statement. As you write job descriptions , make sure your job postings are optimized for search engines , by including SEO-rich keywords whenever possible. This will help your postings rank higher and drive more traffic to your open role. And remember, most applicants today are searching and applying for jobs on their phones. Listing the job description in short paragraphs and/or bullet form is ideal. Applicants' qualifications Let’s dive a little deeper into qualifications. In your job description , it’s important that you make a distinction between what's required and what's preferred but not mandatory. Most often, the qualifications that need explicit parameters include: Education Experience Certifications Language proficiency Skills Providing this level of clarity around qualifications helps applicants see whether or not they would be a great fit for the role before they invest any of their time (and yours!) pursuing the role. Bonus tip: Watch your budget With Indeed for employers, you have the option to sponsor job posts to maximize their exposure and reach. It’s a great feature to use. Make sure to track your job posting via Indeed 's performance reports so you can make sure your investment is producing the results you need. You can modify or cancel sponsored posts anytime by selecting \"Edit Job\" in the employer dashboard . Pricing is always a big factor for anyone looking to post on Indeed so if you want more than free job postings , sponsored job postings will be a great solution. Indeed is a great place to find a candidate for hire. That's why it's one of 25,000 job boards Workstream integrates with to make it easy for employers to source candidates. Want to learn how you can post to Indeed —and thousands of other job boards —through a single click and a  streamlined experience?

Many are left wondering how to navigate it without a dedicated hiring team or sufficient budget. The solution? Enter Hiring software . This modern-day knight-in-shining-armor doesn't just help you get through your day-to-day HR tasks—it also plays an instrumental role in transforming your entire recruitment process . Imagine this: You're juggling multiple job boards , tracking countless resumes and conducting interviews—now think about doing all that on a single platform. That's exactly what hiring software lets you do. However, for many small businesses who frequently experience financial difficulties, these convenient tools may appear too good to be true. Recent statistics suggest that less than half of them use such platforms because they believe they can't afford it. The Challenges Faced by Small Businesses in Hiring In the absence of a designated HR team and adequate resources, finding suitable candidates becomes as hard as finding a needle in haystacks—the size of Mount Everest. But with robust recruiting software solutions like Zoho Recruit , even the smallest teams can compete with big names when it comes to sourcing top talent . A well-chosen hiring system not only streamlines processes but also ensures that no great candidate slips through unnoticed. It helps manage applications from multiple job boards efficiently while making sure each potential hire gets personalized attention—a win-win. Evaluating Key Features of Hiring Software for Small Businesses Choosing the right hiring software is a crucial step in optimizing your recruitment process . To make a knowledgeable decision, it is important to evaluate both basic and more advanced features. Essential Features for Streamlining Recruitment The core functionalities that small businesses should look out for include job posting , resume parsing , and interview scheduling . Job posting features allow HR teams to distribute their vacancies across multiple job boards simultaneously with just one click. Resume parsing tools help streamline the initial screening process by automatically extracting relevant information from resumes . Meanwhile, integrated interview scheduling helps save time coordinating between candidates and interviewers. Advanced Features for Comprehensive Candidate Management Apart from these basics, there are other comprehensive candidate management solutions that can provide more value. These include performance management tools which aid in assessing potential hires' skills or cultural fit through predefined metrics or assessments . Betterteam offers this as part of its standout feature set. An important consideration when selecting software is ensuring it aligns with your business needs without exceeding budget constraints – according to stats 69% of successful marketers report having a strategy in place. Leveraging Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) in Small Business Recruitment Despite the complexity of recruitment, an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) can help small businesses streamline the process. But what if I told you that an applicant tracking system could help? Let's explore how ATS can make your recruitment more efficient. The Power of ATS in Screening and Tracking Candidates An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) isn't just for big companies - it's a game-changer for small businesses too. With this software, screening candidates becomes less of a chore. You get to easily sort through potential applicants based on qualifications or experience without having to manually go through every single resume . The magic doesn't stop there. The same tool lets you track each candidate’s progress throughout your hiring process . It helps keep everyone on the same page - no need to juggle multiple spreadsheets or email threads anymore. You might think such tools are expensive but fear not. There are affordable options designed specifically with small businesses in mind. These platforms offer free trials so you can see firsthand how they'll fit into your operations before making any commitment. Incorporating an ATS into your recruitment strategy not only streamlines the process but also allows for improved communication within HR teams and better relationship management with candidates. Moral of our little chat: Leveraging technology is essential in today’s fast-paced world, even when it comes to recruiting talent. Utilizing Hiring Platforms for Enhanced Recruitment Strategies In today's digital age, hiring platforms are revolutionizing the way small businesses approach their recruitment strategies. These platforms, like Zoho Recruit , not only let you post job ads on multiple job boards but also include applicant tracking software that simplifies candidate sourcing and streamlines your hiring process . The power of a well-designed hiring platform doesn't stop there though. One key feature is how it makes managing candidate data effortless. An important part of any modern-day recruitment strategy involves leveraging social media as a potent tool for employer branding and reaching out directly to prospective employees. With this capability integrated into most hiring software solutions these days, casting a wider net has never been easier or more effective. All things considered; if you're looking at enhancing your recruitment processes while staying within budget constraints - investing in robust yet affordable hiring software should be top priority. So why wait? Start exploring these dynamic platforms now and get ready to take your small business ' growth story several notches higher. The Impact of Recruitment Software on Small Business Growth Recruitment software can have a profound impact on the growth trajectory of small businesses . By streamlining the hiring process , these tools let HR teams focus more on strategic tasks that contribute to business expansion. One way recruitment software helps is by speeding up candidate sourcing . Instead of manually posting job ads across multiple job boards and social media platforms, businesses can use this tool to post jobs in one click. This not only saves time but also increases reach and visibility. Apart from improving efficiency in candidate sourcing and tracking, recruitment software also facilitates better communication with candidates through built-in messaging or email integration options - keeping everyone involved informed at all stages during the hiring process . Leveraging Technology for Talent Pool Management An effective hiring strategy involves maintaining a healthy talent pool. Having an applicant tracking system (ATS) enables businesses to manage their talent pools effectively by storing candidate data securely in one place. Beyond storage convenience though, having an ATS lets employers carry out background checks easily while employee referrals become simpler due to integrated referral management systems offered by some providers . This goes beyond mere conveniences; when used right such technology-based solutions foster sustainable growth within small enterprises looking forward towards expanding their operations confidently. Ensuring Successful Implementation of Hiring Software The successful implementation of hiring software is a game-changer for small businesses . It's not just about installing the software and expecting magic to happen, but more about how you use it effectively. Let's start by making sure we choose a software solution that aligns with your business needs. For instance, if resume parsing and job posting are essential aspects of your recruitment process , these features should be top priority when choosing a system. Familiarize Yourself With The System Your first step towards effective utilization is getting to know the system inside out. Spend time learning each feature in detail so you can leverage them fully during your hiring process . If the tool includes an applicant tracking system (ATS), make sure everyone involved understands how to use it for screening candidates and keeping track of their progress through different stages of selection. Pilot Test Before Full-Scale Implementation No matter how promising or popular a software solution may seem, there’s no guarantee that it will work perfectly within your specific business context from day one. So before going all-in, run pilot tests on selected roles or departments first. This way, any potential issues can be spotted early on and resolved without causing disruption across the whole company. Involving Your Team in The Process To get buy-in from everyone who’ll be using this new tool - including HR teams as well as line managers - involve them in its rollout right from the inception stage. This not only ensures smoother adoption but also fosters ownership among users which translates into better engagement levels over time. With careful planning coupled with proper training, you'll be able to ensure the successful implementation of your hiring software . Key Takeaway: Picking the perfect hiring software can totally transform your small business . But remember, it's not just about snagging the tool - knowing how to effectively use it is key. Ensure its features match your needs, get fully acquainted with it and conduct trial runs before a complete rollout. Bring in all folks who'll be using this tool right from the get-go – including HR teams . FAQs in Relation to Hiring Software for Small Business What kind of software do recruiters use?

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 05/14/21 3 reasons why QSRs are struggling to hire Share this article Restaurants are starting to completely reopen and consumers are gaining confidence to eat out again, but are restaurant workers ready to come back to work? A handful of economic factors point to the perfect storm of low supply and high demand in the hunt for hourly employees. QSR owner/operators and hiring managers should keep these in mind as they put time and money into recruiting talent. Stimulus checks are frustrating the supply of job seekers The IRS recently reported that Economic Impact Payments for 90 million qualifying Americans began dropping into personal checking accounts again on March 12th, 2021. Another 37 million payments were reported on March 24th, followed by several million more announced on April 1st. This makes a total of 130 million payments worth about $335 billion being distributed in the past 30 days. Stimulus checks may be delaying employment seekers from taking job action. Over the past 30 days, QSR owners have reported seeing former employees come out to eat, but demonstrate little interest in jumping back into the workforce. Likewise, other QSR owners have reported a 66% decrease in front-of-house applicants and an 88% decrease in delivery driver applications over the same time period. To put all of this in perspective, consider the following example. A married couple with two kids will receive $1,400 for each qualifying adult and for each qualifying tax dependent. So this family of four could receive $5,600 in a single stimulus check payment. Employment Services professionals estimate that potential workers will abstain from active job seeking until this stimulus money runs out. But this is not the only reason potential job seekers might stay home. Unemployment benefits may have a longer-term impact on job seeker supply Federal unemployment benefits were recently extended through September 6th, 2021, giving qualifying Americans $300 per week. Over the next 25 weeks these individuals will receive $7,500 from the Federal government in addition to the unemployment benefits they may receive from their state government. While stimulus checks may be spent almost as quickly as they arrive, the unemployment benefits pose a longer-term effect on the supply of job seekers. Although, it’s worth noting that state unemployment benefits will vary substantially from state to state. And states such as Arkansas, Montana, and South Carolina have already opted out of the Federal Unemployment benefits provided by the American Rescue Plan, in an effort to eliminate any disincentives for potential job seekers. Demand for hourly workers is up… way up! Consider this $1.9 trillion stimulus package against the backdrop of broader COVID-19 vaccine availability and many state economies opening back up. In recent days both California and New York , arguably amongst the most strict states in regards to pandemic closures, are reporting strong progress toward reopening. Additionally, the old adage, “money burns a hole in one’s pocket” seems to be holding true as consumers begin to flock back to restaurants and bars, likely with stimulus checks “in-hand.” Chief Economist at Indeed.com, Jed Kolko, recently reported that job postings on Indeed have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. As of March 18th, 2021, there were 10.7% more jobs listed on Indeed than there were on February 1st, 2020. However, restaurant owners are struggling to find applicants . Workstream CEO, Desmond Lim, is calling this phenomenon The 2021 Great Rehiring . Restaurant owners that had to lay off virtually their entire staff, are now having to rehire that amount and more , but the supply of job seekers is clearly at a painful low. While employee hiring has always been one of the top challenges for restaurants, it is now by far the biggest challenge for restaurants across the country. How to make hiring your competitive advantage QSRs are faced with the decision to adapt to these circumstances or to continue struggling. Many are seeing a meaningful impact with just a handful of changes to their hiring strategy. Here are three of the most impactful changes reported by QSRs. 1. Up your wages It may seem obvious, but we recommend that you consider upping your wages. Restaurants that pay above minimum wage are effectively jumping to the front of the line when it comes to sourcing applicants. 2. Review and revise your job posting strategy Are you spending money to promote your job postings? Do you take a “set it and forget it” approach to your job ads? If so, then you may need to revisit and revise your bids. In a more competitive market, what you were willing to pay for a click last year likely won’t get you the same result now. A quick check-in may reveal that you actually haven’t been spending at all. 3. Be the first. Be the best at hiring. If you are spending money to promote your jobs, but it takes you too much time to source, screen, and interview candidates, then you’re likely wasting a lot of money. Reaching applicants immediately after they apply and reaching them on their mobile devices will make hiring your competitive advantage in these tough market conditions. Find out how thousands of QSRs are using Workstream’s powerful hiring platform , built on automation and 2-way text messaging, to be the first to source, screen, interview, and hire candidates. Summary Economic relief and stimulus from the Federal Government is likely creating passivity in prospective job seekers, while states are re-opening, consumer confidence is rising, and the need to hire is bouncing back in a massive way. Restaurant owners and hiring managers need to review and revise their hiring strategy across wages, job ads, and the technology needed to succeed in extremely competitive circumstances.

On May 8 2020, the New York Times published an article on how the American economy has lost over 30 million jobs in the space of 6 weeks, as the unemployment rate jumped to over 15%, the worst since the Great Depression. The Labor Department published a report that showed the clearest picture yet of the breadth and depth of the economic damage, and how swiftly it spread, as the coronavirus pandemic has swept the country. Job losses impacted the entire economy, from restaurant to retail and more. Areas like hospitality were impacted the strongest, but even healthcare shed over a million jobs. Low wage workers, including many women and members of racial and ethnic minorities, were hit especially hard. The scale of the job losses in April 2020 alone far exceed the 8.7 million lost in the last recession, when unemployment peaked at 10 percent in October 2009. “I thought the Great Recession was once in a lifetime, but this is much worse,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global. The only comparable period is when unemployment reached about 25 percent in 1933, before the government began publishing official statistics. Looking Forward with O ptimism Like many of you, I enter each new year with optimism. Like many others, I was wondering whether or not restaurants, local businesses or retail may ever recover from the impact of Covid-19 and the devastating job losses that impacted the economy in 2020. It was hard to predict or forecast in January or February of how the world and America was moving towards - will the unemployment trend continue or will the economy start to re-bounce back? Last week, I went on my first business trip in a long time , to Salt Lake City, where I spent two energizing week with my team in Utah, planning out our 2021 business strategy and goals. I felt like a hermit coming out of the cave in a long time - each experiences, from buying a milkshake at a cafe, checking in for my flight, to having lunch with my colleagues - was energizing and liberating. (I made sure to have my mask on at all times where possible, practiced social distancing, regularly washed my hands!) Getting back into Palo Alto last weekend, I went to nearby Stanford Shopping Centre, where to my bewilderment, I could not find parking on a Saturday afternoon after almost 20 minutes of looking for a parking spot. In addition, when I tried to buy bread from my favorite local bakery at 3.30pm on a Saturday, the shop had a sign saying \"Closed - sold out due to lack of manpower\" and next to the sign read \"We are hiring!\". That was when it hit me - local businesses are not going away. People want to meet in person, visit restaurants and local businesses, and meet in person. People want to be able to leave their homes, and do not want to spend their entire lives staring into monitors or just stay at home. That was when it hit me - local businesses are not going away. People want to meet in person, visit restaurants and local businesses, and meet in person. Over the past 12 months, me and my team at Workstream have been doing our best to stay close to our restaurant partners and local business owners, to do our best to help them overcome the devastating impact of Covid-19, and doing our best to empower them to be able to hire the hourly workers they need. In the past 8 weeks, we have felt a different type of energy as we speak with our restaurant customers and partners. There is a clear increase in demand from consumers who not only want to dine out and meet people, but is wanting to consume and spend even more then pre-Covid, as they are excited to make up for the loss of in-person time as they were shelter in place at home over the past year. At the same time, we hear a clear demand from our restaurant customers and local business partners that there is a clear trend that is emerging - we need to hire, and we need to hire fast. We need to bring back the talent we had before Covid, and more. Hourly workers want to get back into the job market and are aggressively looking for the right fit and the right jobs, and local business owners need to rapidly bring on the best talent, train them up and step up for the surge in demand. The Challenge We Face As Jeff Jordan of a16z wrote in his article , \"Rebuilding the labor market is a much more complex task than a market rebound. As we rebuild, an inevitable reshuffling will happen. Businesses and job seekers will experience an accelerated sorting of talent and opportunity. But the fallout from the economic shutdown is like throwing a pack of cards in the air: you can eventually put the deck back together, but not everyone will end up in the same spot.\" Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the current infrastructure of the economy is built to be able to support a turnover of 3-4 %, not the current turnover of over 30% that the economy has been dealt with over the past 12 months. The average time to hire in 2018 was 38 days , a timeline that is far too long to be able to efficiently realign and reshuffle the the hourly worker landscape, which is where most of the jobs were lost and now in the coming months, will be added back, from hospitality, healthcare to restaurant jobs. In the hourly worker space, potential job seekers are looking to find new work and jobs in the same day or within hours. They are increasingly used to the opportunity to find new job opportunities from gig-based companies like DoorDash, Uber, Instacart, and local businesses inevitably will have to compete with them for talent. In addition, there is an average turnover of 150% in the industry, which means that the typical business owner who has 300 employees, is having to hire one new person everyday or make 25+ new hires every month in normal times, and in today's world, there are needing to hire at least 3X as fast, in order to keep up with the demand, and the lack of manpower due to Covid-19. At the same time, local businesses are not equipped with the right technology, software infrastructure or tools to be able to recruit efficiently and quickly. In our survey done with thousands of local business owners, many of them still rely on software infrastructure that were built over 10 years ago, pre-mobile, pre-internet, and built upon on-premise software. We were also astonished to see many business owners still relying on pen and paper, word of mouth or even walk-ins. The Great Rehiring The first day I went back into our Utah office, I could feel an incredible amount of energy and passion. It was a function of the talent and energy of our team, but at the same time, it was a result of the energy we feel from our customers and clients - at Workstream , we are on a mission to empower local businesses and local businesses to do better work. As my fellow streamers speak with customers on the phone and engage with them, it has become clearer and clearer that we have an important mission to help our restaurant and local business partners to be able to find and recruit the talent they need, in order to re-open their business, re-hire the talent they need, and to re-energize their company. Having spoke 1 on 1 with hundreds of customers in the past few months and meeting with numerous mentors, advisors and investors in the restaurant and local business sector, it is apparent, over the past 12 months, the number 1 challenge that local business owners are having is the constant struggle with recruiting and finding the right talent. At the same time, millions of jobless Americans and potential job seekers is also highly motivated to get back into the job market, to re-engage with business owners, and to be able to get into the right job position. Here are a few trends that the 2021 Great Rehiring may bring about - Trends of the Great Rehiring 1) The need for speed in recruiting will be most important than ever In 2018, the average time to hire was 38 days, and that does not include onboarding, training and more. That speed is no longer enough. On Workstream , we have seem our restaurant and local business partners getting their first interviews and hiring people within hours and days. Potential job candidates today want to move fast, and want to be able to find work immediately. A delay of a few days or weeks will mean that the candidate has moved on to the next opportunity. In a competitive market for talent, business owners and restaurant franchisees need to be able to ramp up the speed of recruiting by reaching out to potential job candidates quickly, often within the same day, if not in the same hour. It is crucial to be able to find the right candidate rapidly in order to be able to make up for the lack of manpower as a function of the impact of Covid-19. 2) Local businesses are adopting software and technology more rapidly Due to Covid-19, many employers and employees had to adopt software and technology rapidly in order to survive, to grow and to move things forward. From technologies such as Zoom video conferencing to scheduling tools, we have seen a surge in business and restaurant owners who have step up to adopt technology and software rapidly in order to stay in line with needs of today's climate. At the same time, it is also safer to be interviewing and recruiting candidates by using software tools like text recruiting and video tools, as compared to meeting candidates in person from the first interaction. This shift in adopting software and technology will also help both business owners and candidates to be more efficient in matching. 3) Mobile-based and text recruiting will become mainstream Even before Covid-19, we had seen a clear trend of both business owners and job candidates wanting to communicate via texting, SMS, and mobile phone. Text messages has a 95% open rate, compared to email which only has a 20% open rate . At the same time, the penetration and adoption of mobile phone has reached an all time high for millennials and generation Z, who is the mainly supply of job candidates for local businesses. It is obvious to business owners that we speak with and help, the mobile-based and text recruiting will become mainstream in the coming months and years, and we could see a clear trend of it becoming a necessary was for business owners and job seekers to communicate as it is more efficient, faster and safer. 4) Local businesses and restaurants are here to stay, and will grow stronger Before and during Covid-19, there were always talk of the offline market and local businesses diminishing and becoming smaller. On the contrary, I think Covid-19 has ensured that the strongest local business owners stay on and grow even more. We have seen an outsized acquisition and expansion strategy and initiative by the top franchisee owners. We have also seen that Covid-19 has led to more opportunities for new entrepreneurs to leverage the lower rent and leasing terms in order to start new businesses and grow their businesses. Based on the growth in consumer demand to meet in person, dine out and to shop local, we firmly believe that local businesses and restaurants are here to stay. The best entrepreneurs and franchisees will thrive even more post Covid-19, and will be able to leverage technology, software and more to grow even faster. 5) Diversity is more important than ever in recruiting We have seen the importance of recruiting from a diverse pool of job candidates, and leveraging software and tools to do so. We have seen that the ability to leverage a wide pool of candidates not only from a wider pool of job boards, build a referral program, set up offline text to apply channels , and sourcing talent from less traditional channels have benefitted many of the thousands of hiring managers that we work with on a day to day basis. We have also found that by being open to recruit talent from a wider pool both in terms of channels, but also demographics, it ensures more stability and innovation in a company as employees come from different backgrounds and are able to contribute more. The Path Forward At Workstream , we are excited to be able to work with hundreds of restaurants, local businesses and more, helping them daily with their hiring needs via text recruiting and more. In our daily conversations with franchisees, business owners and more, we see a rapidly adoption of technology, software and more, and we are humbled and honored to have a role to play in that movement. We see a clear movement that \"The Great Rehiring\" is a movement that will happen over the coming months and more. We are excited to help local businesses and restaurants ramp up their hiring, and humbled to play a role in helping our partners, customers and local business owners re-open, re-hire and grow faster.

We are also always actively hiring and please feel free to look at the job openings we have here.

And if you understand the differences between them—and why they both matter to a successful and sustainable hiring strategy—you can increase the odds that you’ll have the best talent available working for you. Sounds pretty appealing, right? That’s why we’ve put together this blog post that’s going to walk you through: The difference between these two restaurant recruitment strategies Examples of recruiting strategies (inbound and outbound) for QSRs Let’s get started! Inbound vs. outbound recruiting Inbound recruiting and outbound recruiting share the same goal, but how they look in practice is not the same. Here’s an overview of what each term means: Inbound recruiting , or passive hiring, is the method of attracting potential candidates to your business. You put out honey, and the bees come to you. Outbound recruiting , or active hiring, is when a business goes on the search for potential candidates. You bring honey with you, and you offer it to the bees. Now, the honey is an apt image because all employees take jobs to meet certain needs. An income is the obvious one, but candidates have other needs that your company might match: a particular benefits package, a strong community culture or opportunities for career growth. Inbound hiring strategies broadcast those aspects of your organization—the flavor of your honey, if you will—on an ongoing basis, to build brand awareness. The idea is that potential employees will like what they see over time, and the right ones will decide they want to work with you. These long-term recruitment strategies are based on the premise that you will always need to seek out new team members, which is particularly true in the QSR space. Outbound hiring strategies are more immediate. If you need to fill a particular role, and you announce you are hiring for that role or you recruit specific individuals who are suited to that position, you’re using active hiring practices. You’ll still use your company culture and benefits as incentives, but your goal is to get them to apply for that job—not to sell them on your company. 8 inbound and outbound recruitment strategies for QSRs QSRs traditionally conduct more outbound hiring practices. But relying on these as the primary driver for applications limits your flow of candidates. Incorporating both inbound and outbound recruitment strategies will create a more sustainable rolling hiring strategy. Let’s look at examples of recruitment strategies and how you can start integrating them into your overall hiring strategy. #1 Develop and promote your brand and culture Your company culture is a critical part of sourcing the best-fit candidates who want to know what they’re applying for—beyond a wage. According to recent surveys , nearly half of hourly workers find culture to be important. But culture is one of those hard-to-define and even-harder-to-explain concepts. So, how do you translate the on-the-job experience to a pool of potential employees? And how does it impact your hiring results? Start by asking yourself (and your team!) questions like: “Why would a motivated person feel drawn to work for this business?” “Why do our most dedicated team members continue to stay working with us?” The answers to those questions can form the basis for how you show off your restaurant in your job ads, social media, career page, and overall website. The culture you promote can also dig into the shared ethos of the organization. What are the shared values, goals, attitudes and practices of your company? Candidates who jive with those core tenets of your business are more likely to apply for jobs—and to stick with them once they’re hired. #2 Build a branded career page One of the first places to implement your culture is a branded career page on your website. Candidates will have an experience with this page that will shape their impression of your entire business, and it will be a major factor in deciding whether they want to work with you. According to one survey , 56% of job applicants believe they can tell what it will be like to work at a company from its career page. To attract top candidates, your career page should: Share the company’s story by providing genuine photos and videos (NOT stock imagery or footage), employee-created content, employee testimonials and messaging tailored to your culture. Reach the right candidates by creating content and job descriptions for the applicants you want—which can go so far as personalizing content based on what’s relevant to them. Drive applications by helping candidates to self-select whether they are a good fit for your company, culture and available positions. Remember, too, that a career page is about more than just the content—it’s also about the feel of the content. Everything from your color scheme to your font choices, the accessibility of the layout, and the functionality of the page reflect your business’s values and attitude. #3 Use diverse job board platforms Some recruitment strategies are tried-and-true because they work. There’s a reason businesses still put “Now hiring” signs in the window, after all. And certain online boards, like Monster.com, are here to stay. But more avenues for hiring exist now than ever before. You should use as many of these job boards as reasonably possible so that you’re not missing out on all the new applicants turning to these new and diverse channels. Not only are you losing out on some top candidates with your absence, but they are going to work for your competitors instead. To start, make sure you’re at least posting on these top 14 job boards . It’s also important to maximize your time and efforts. Posting job openings on multiple platforms can consume all of a hiring manager’s time, not to mention handling all the incoming applications and inquiries. You can reach a wider audience of potential candidates with exponentially less effort on your end by using a platform that automates this process . #4 Involve your current employees Your current employees are your single greatest recruitment resource. Third-party endorsements, such as your employees’ positive comments, add depth to your business’s credibility. Their testimonials, photos and videos on your career page will do more to advocate for your company than any marketing-speak you can dream up. Starbucks’ careers page on Instagram ( @starbucksjobs ) is one great example of incorporating current employees into a hiring strategy. Beyond their expert ways of broadcasting their culture through concise copy and wordplay, they have an abundance of employee portrayals on their feed. This inclusion offers prospective hires a glimpse into how their work lives could look, if they apply to one of the many Starbucks locations. #5 Incentivize referral programs When current employees recommend friends and family to work for you, that is more effective than any job posting. Think about it: Wouldn’t you be most likely to suggest a workplace to your best friends if you enjoy working there yourself? You might be benefitting from organic referrals from your employees already. Great. But you can increase your reach simply by incentivizing your employee referral program . (As an example, you might pay a referring employee $300 for each referral that is hired and stays on for 60 days.) And they will be worthwhile investments—even beyond the costs of hiring. Because of that personalized recommendation from someone who experiences your company culture, referred candidates tend to fit right into the culture and stick with the company 20% longer than non-referred candidates. #6 Leverage social media platforms Social media platforms offer you to enact inbound and outbound hiring practices all at once. Your posts are a stellar way to engage both customers and potential employees—who are most likely already customers themselves. And a truly engaging social media presence is itself a branding tool: look no farther than Wendy’s willingness to roast anyone and everyone on Twitter, and you’ll understand the power of an active account. However you implement social media, your presence will cultivate your audience’s expectations of what it’s like to work with you. Diving into how to use each platform for employee recruiting strategies is beyond the scope of this blog post. But here’s a helpful guide from Sprout Social on recruiting via social media platforms . #7 Diversify your team Diversity in your workforce, attained through a conscientious hiring practice , can make your team more versatile, more creative and more relatable to customers. Think about it: you have a diverse customer base. That’s likely true in terms of age, ethnic background, gender identity and socioeconomic status. The more your team behind the counter reflects the customers in front of it, the more your employees will be able to relate to customer needs and desires. And this is true for more than just hourly workers—if your hiring manager and your marketer reflect different aspects of your customer base, for example, they’ll be better able to develop an effective hiring campaign that speaks more directly to the community. #8 Hire both internally and externally The debate between hiring in-house employees for other roles and hiring outside candidates is often framed as a build-or-buy conundrum. Do you build up from within, or “buy” from outside the company? A comprehensive, sustainable hiring program requires you to think more build-and-buy . Internal hires have an understanding of what the hourly workers are doing and experiencing. They also understand your culture, and they’ll see how you’ve invested in them and believed in them. Promoting from within tends to be faster and less costly, as well. But external hires have benefits too; namely, you can draw from a much larger pool of applicants. These candidates might have more experience in the particular role you’re filling, especially if it’s a supervisory or skilled position. However, they will need to learn the culture as they go. In the QSR space, many hourly workers are external hires simply because these are fairly entry-level positions. You might hire within to fill other hourly positions, though—say if a cook has an interest in moving to a front-of-house role. But, if you’re looking to hire for a position that could go either way, here’s a resource from Indeed on the pros and cons of internal vs. external hiring . Key Takeaways When it comes to recruiting for QSRs, there are two main recruitment strategies that hiring managers and business owners can use: inbound recruiting and outbound recruiting. And while you may be able to build a hiring plan using just one of these strategies, you’ll have better luck sourcing the most qualified candidates if you use a mix of both. To do that, implement the 8 tips we’ve shared in this blog post: Develop and promote your brand culture Build a branded career page Use diverse job board platforms Involve your current employees Incentivize referral programs Leverage social media Diversify your team Hire both internally and externally And if, during all of this, you realize that you’ll need a new tool to help you recruit and onboard new hourly employees, check out Workstream.

Everything from the recruiting strategies needed to the application process is daunting! Even if you attract good applicants, there's so much back-and-forth during the hiring process to get them on the interview schedule. Let’s not even get into no-shows, mistake hires, and high turnover rates . Plus, you have to be cognizant of constantly changing laws - are you asking the right questions in the interview? Did you collect all the necessary paperwork to ensure workers are legally able to work for you? We understand your frustrations. That's why we compiled this Ultimate Guide to sourcing, interviewing and hiring Hourly Employees . We also share various tips and tricks for an interview to avoid common pitfalls that many hiring managers encounter, and discuss on how to construct a job description that clearly conveys your expectations. Additionally, this guide covers how to streamline your processes to save you time and find the best candidates possible. Table of Contents Identifying Who to Hire Sourcing Candidates Scheduling & Interviewing Onboarding Hourly Employees Identifying Who to Hire Know Your CAPS Finding the right hourly employee is no easy feat. Many businesses make the mistake of throwing out a job application and then hiring anyone with a pulse. Businesses should always aim to find quality candidates; people who have the required skills, experience, a positive attitude, and integrity. First you need to establish what the ideal candidate looks like. Remember CAPS: Capacities - the physical and mental requirements to do the job Attitudes - customer service skills, dependability, etc. Personality - the traits needed such as temperament and assertiveness Skills - what is required to perform well on the job Acquiring this information won’t take long. Simply look at what is currently required for the job positions you have. What does it take to carry out the duties of these jobs? What are the skill sets required to perform the job successfully? What kind of attitude and personality would one need to possess not just to perform the job, but also fit into the culture of the business? Design a Job Description Constructing a job description that conveys your expectations clearly can sometimes be difficult. Since you’ve identified the type of employee you need, it’ll take no more than 30 minutes to design a good job description . Job descriptions are designed to be a useful, plain-language tool that explains the key responsibilities and expectations of a position while keeping it concise and relevant to the job opening . Indeed has found that job descriptions that are between 700 to 2,000 characters receive up to 30% more applicants and this number is even higher with hourly jobs . Although the structure of the job description may vary from company to company, they should all be standardized with the same appearance. Here are the essentials to include when constructing your job description : Job title - name of the position Salary grade - compensation levels, including minimum and maximum pay Position type and expected hours of work - define if the position is full time or part time , typical work hours and shifts, days of week, and whether overtime is expected Expected start date - date in which you expect the employee to be available to start Key responsibilities - communicate the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities of the employee Competency - the type of skills and abilities that the employee requires to perform the tasks of the job Work environment - describe the type of work environment that the employee would be working in such as if it is in an outdoor environment etc. Physical demands - describe the physical demands of the job, including bending, sitting, lifting and driving Required education and experience - include if the candidate must have a certain level of education or experience based on requirements that are job-related Additional eligibility qualifications - any additional requirements such as certifications, industry-specific experience and the experience working with certain equipment (e.g. forklift operations, short-order cook, phone operations) Affirmative action plan / equal employment opportunity (AAP/EEO) statement - include here that you are an equal opportunity employer. Other similar statements and communications should be included in your hiring packet or employee handbook Once you’ve completed your analysis on the type of employee you are searching for, and tailored a job description for this role, you’re ready to look for candidates to fill this vacant spot. Sourcing Candidates Know Where to Look Talent acquisition can seem difficult but candidates for hourly employment are everywhere. In fact, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , 59% of the US workforce, or roughly 78 million Americans are now paid on an hourly basis. Often, we find it difficult to reach out to these people but truly, we are just not looking in the right places. There are six main channels of reaching out to these potential candidates - (1) employee referrals , (2) company website, (3) job boards , (4) walk-ins, (5) social media , and (6) local advertising. According to the Pew Research Center , millennials are the largest workforce in the US. These millennials are the ones that are constantly on social media - Facebook, Instagram and many more. Businesses who tap into these social channels strategically will be able to find a wealth of qualified candidates. Here are five tips , by order of importance, for finding quality hourly employees : Go Social - Be strategic with copywriting and the places you place your job search ads. You can form or join specific groups to increase the quality of your applicants. For example, you can form “Coffee Experts in San Francisco” to search for baristas, or “Hostess with the Mostest in Redwood City”, to attract hourly employees for your restaurant. Go with Referrals - Businesses tend to prefer candidates through referrals as they trust the good employees to recommend someone that is similar to them. Building up a strong referral program with incentives will help to increase your inflow of quality candidates. Go Postal - Get in the habit of posting, or delegating this task, a job available everyday on top internet sites such as Craigslist , Indeed , and ZipRecruiter . By consistently posting and re-posting your job ads daily, you may be able to move up the lists and stay fresh in the eyes of the job seeker . Play around with the creativity of your job search ads while being concise. Go to the Fair - Local job fairs are time-consuming and costly, but can sometimes be worth it. If the timing and location of the organized job fair is right, you will be able to attract the right candidates for the role. Your team should be ready to speak to those that express interest. Prepare packages with your company’s information or some swag to attract people to your booth. When Boston Beer, maker of Sam Adams attended a job fair, they handed out bottle openers with their name on them. Go Back to School - Some local schools may put on job fairs too, but aside from those, visit high schools and community colleges in your area and ask where you can post information about your company. Most universities and some high schools allow you to place information in a designated location where students can find job ads at. Be creative with your ads and company literature. Remember, you are competing with so many other businesses as well. Just as with fishing, you have to go where the fish are - or where you think they will be going. Job candidates can be a slippery bunch. Use these five tips to reel them in and keep them. Be Attractive The hourly workers space can be very competitive. In order to attract the suitable hourly employee , the business has to appear presentable. Making your business more attractive to those seeking employment will help you stand out above the noise of so many more hustling to latch onto hourly candidates . Gap is a good example of how to attract potential employees . To attract and retain quality hourly employees , you must first develop what is known as Employee Value Proposition (EVP), which is a fancy term defining the total value an employer offers to their employees in return for their work. It is more than compensation and benefits, or tangible rewards, but a mix of tangible and intangible rewards such as great company culture, flexible hours, proper training etc. Here are four things to consider when trying to appear attractive in the hourly space: Be Positive - Creating a positive work environment is key to retaining your hourly employees . You can start off with the use of positive reinforcement in your workplace. Start off with using words like “I enjoy working with you”, or “You’ve done a great job! I’m proud of you”, can go a long way to motivate and engage your employees. This sends the message that your business is a positive and fun place to work. Through word-of-mouth, this will spread. A typical social conversation among potential candidates can easily revolve around work, and it will not be surprising that your company pops up as a topic since it is known to have a positive work environment. Implement Creative Compensation - Do more than simply offer a better paycheck than your competitors. Come up with creative incentives that appeal more to your employees. You can opt to give movie tickets or concert tickets as rewards and bonuses. Develop Great Culture - Company culture is an important factor in determining the turnover rate of your employees - it is about the theme or interwoven thread that runs through the business. A good culture is welcoming, interesting and one that listens to their employees. To develop a good company culture, you’ll have to understand your employees so that you can appeal to them. Install Opportunities for Work Life Balance - Everyone values work life balance. Try to offer flexibility in your work schedules such that your employees are able to accommodate time for their family, school or any other commitments. If one has been working on a night shift this week, you can offer them a day shift for the following week so that they will be able to spend time with their families too. Interviewing Applicants Preparation, Profiling and Promotion Like many important things in life, interviewing job candidates for your business should begin with a plan. You can’t just call in someone interested in the position and chat for 10 to 15 minutes without an aim in mind. To start off, you can list out what are the things that you would like to find out at the end of the chat and what determines if a candidate is successful. There are three main categories that you will want to be sure to cover in the interview: Availability - Scheduling can be extremely challenging especially with many employees. Aim to find out what the candidate expects of his or her work schedules. You can ask questions like: Are you available to work weekends? Are you available to work on holidays? Are you able to work the night shift? What other commitments do you have? Do you have any preferred schedule for your work hours? Retention - Turnovers are expensive and time-consuming. When you find a good employee, you will probably want to try to keep them for a long time. You can determine the candidate’s intentions by asking the following: How long did you stay at your last job? Why did you leave that job? What are some of the things that would make you stay at this job if you get hired? Where do you see yourself a year from now? Where do you see yourself five years from now? Conflict Resolution - Employees who work well together are more engaged in their work and therefore more productive. Of course, not everyone will get along well all the time, and when that happens, you will want to know that your employees can be mature and professional in these situations. You can get an idea of the way the candidate deals with conflict with these questions: How do you handle stress while at work? Have you ever had a conflict (confrontation, arguing, disagreeing), with any co-workers before? How did you handle the aforementioned conflict? Can you tell me a situation where you resolved a conflict at your last job? What do you think is the best action to take when you have conflict with a co-worker? You may need to brainstorm for other questions that fit your particular industry. Aim to keep your questions open-ended for them to express themselves. Some of the questions that you should avoid include: Age Race or ethnicity Gender identity, sex and sexual orientation Country of national origin or birthplace Religion Disability Marital or family status or pregnancy You can refer to our interview guide here on the best and worst questions to ask an applicant. Building a Profile Interviewing job candidates is 25% art, 25% skill, and 50% listening. Taking note of their answers in the interview is one thing, but taking note of the way they deliver their answers is another. Are they confident? Do they articulate well in their communication skills? You should have these items ready so that you can refer to them if you need to. They include: Job description Pay range for position Work schedule candidate is expected to fill Benefits offered Candidate’s resume Testimonies from current employees Based on the interview that you have with the candidate, you can quickly build a profile of this person which helps you visualize better if they could be potential candidate. Promotion The interview process isn’t just about learning more about the job candidate. It is also a time for you to promote your business. This is where employee testimonies, customer feedback, and community activity awards prove helpful. Share with the candidate about how your company celebrates employee birthdays, have annual picnics, provide creative perks, and promote the advancement of employee careers. You want to keep a good job candidate with your company and not lose them to the competition. Take this time to explain all of the many benefits of working at your organization. Onboarding Hourly Employees All Aboard! Often referred to as organization socialization or employee orientation, onboarding is simply the introduction phase of the employee lifecycle. For many years, businesses have stuck to the handed down, unproven rule that employees get about 90 days to prove themselves in a new job. This means that the faster new hires feel welcome and prepared for their jobs, the faster they will be able to successfully contribute to the company’s mission and goals. As mentioned earlier, the employee experience you create will get shared with the employee’s peers, family, friends, and their social media following. This development of a program for a great employee experience should start from before the employee is hired. One of the most important phases in the lifecycle of an employee is the onboarding phase. On average, companies lose 17% of their new hires during the first three months of employment. Without a good and structured onboarding process, an employee may flounder and perform poorly, not because of a lack of skills and talents, but because of a lack of knowledge of the company’s values, mission, and processes. We compiled an employee orientation checklist to guide you through this process. How to Onboard Onboarding is a process that should be conducted for every employee. Using a standardized method each time will help you remain consistent and keep all employees on the same page regarding where the company is heading and how the company expects to get there. One helpful tool used by many organizations that provide successful onboarding is called the Four C’s. These are: Compliance - this the base requirement in onboarding your employees and it includes teaching them basic legal and policy-related rules and regulations Clarification - ensure that you communicate clearly on the key responsibilities and expectations of the employee in this role. It is important to let new hires know how their job functions fit into the organization. This allows them to know how they are able to contribute to the success of the organization by giving them a sense of contributing to a greater cause. Culture - exposing your employees to your organizational formal and informal norms help them fit into the company with less friction. This helps them develop a sense of belonging to the company at a faster rate. Connection - this refers to the vital interpersonal relationships and information networks that new employees must establish. Companies like Google heavily emphasize on the importance of onboarding that it uses an electronic checklist to remind managers to discuss the roles and responsibilities with new hires . You can create a similar list or assign a new hire with a peer buddy to show them the ropes and start off the journey with a good experience. Use the Guide, Trust Your Instincts Hiring hourly employees is not an easy task. It is even more difficult when a business or particular industry is prone to high turnover rates . The goal of this guide is to ease the pain and frustration typically experienced when trying to hire new hourly employees into the organization. By following the tips and information provided, we are confident that you will have a better and more successful hiring journey for years to come!

QuikForce was incubated out of the Harvard Innovation Lab and was started to solve the pain of hiring hourly workers to help move furniture, relocate, or to perform home services. Growing up, I watched my dad who worked as a driver delivering goods and packages for over 35 years. Throughout this period, I realized the inefficiencies of the logistics industry and wanted to transform it. It was an antiquated industry where I saw the difficulty for consumers to easily find the right mover or hourly worker to perform the home service needs that they have. QuikForce met with early success - winning the top prize at the TechCrunch pitch-off , expanding rapidly into 5 cities on the East Coast, being featured in Yahoo Finance , Boston Business Journals , BostInno , and more. The team was growing quickly and we needed to acquire and hire hourly workers to meet the growing demand from our customers. In order to meet the rapidly growing demand, I needed to hire over 1,000 hourly workers in less than a month. Therefore, I employed a few different strategies which I will like to share with you below. 1. Post on Craigslist, Indeed.com, Ziprecruiter Everyday These channels remain the best methods for me to reach out to hourly workers, be it drivers, movers or cleaners. I will create and re-post job ads on these channels every day, in order for the job posting to appear at the top of the job boards. I would structure my job postings to be attractive, using titles with the words \"BONUSES guaranteed, $100 tomorrow\", leveraging simple words and sending a clear message that there will be a huge cash incentive for the person who decides to respond to my ads and engage with me. 2. Share on Closed Communities like Facebook Groups, Yelp, etc In order to be exposed to a large community of people, I joined over 500 Facebook Groups throughout the cities that I was part of (I was \"banned temporarily\" by Facebook for a few days but it worked again soon). As I joined more Facebook Groups, I was able to gain access to groups like \"Uber drivers in Boston\" or \"Movers in Cambridge\". This is a trusted network, in which hourly workers are more likely to respond to messages that I post on groups where I share job information. In addition, I also found that Yelp is a good social network for small businesses too. I was able to reach out and contact many small businesses via Yelp who responded to me, allowing me to connect with them. 3. Using SMS / Text Messages to Communicate with Them Emails simply do not work with hourly workers. I tried calling too and it is good to a certain extent, but it may be challenging as many hourly workers are holding multiple jobs or could be driving or working when you are calling him or her. On the other hand, I found that sending SMS and text messages from my personal phone was the best way to reach out to these hourly workers. I will simply use iMessage to copy and paste a template that I will set up on my laptop and mass send that to people. I will even create reminders to follow up with hourly workers on a daily basis so that I will be able to connect with them. 4. Responding Quickly to Them Within Minutes I also found that speed is very important when looking to hire hourly workers. They are looking urgently for work in most instances, and speed of response is key because it conveys that (a) you are serious about potentially hiring them and (b) he or she may be able to start early and soon to get paid. Therefore, I have found that responding quickly to potential hourly hires is very important as it really helps to get the details squared away and to get the potential hourly hire onboarded. 5. Ask for Referrals and Recommendations As with many industries and sectors, referrals work ! Therefore, whenever I hire a new hourly worker, I will immediately ask him or her for 3 introductions or names that I can be put in touch with at that instance. This is very helpful as I am able to create leverage in getting more hourly workers who are of a similar background as those I would like to hire. If I am planning to hire a person who may be a fit for the role, it is almost certain that he or she knows three or more other workers that could be a good fit for the role too. 6. Immediately Schedule a for a Time to Connect Once Engaged Setting a time to connect either via the phone or in-person is very important. Once I have engaged with the hourly worker, I will immediately manually schedule a time to meet with him or her to see if it is a good fit for us. Scheduling for a time is almost the hardest thing to coordinate between my own busy schedule and that of the hourly workers'. Therefore, I will create 15-minute time slots everyday and assign at least 3 hours to meet with groups of up to 10 hourly workers at once in order to quickly identify who may be a good fit for the job. It was a really fun time to source, hire and onboard 1,000 hourly workers within 4 weeks. I learned a lot, but it was also extremely tiring and time-consuming. I worked 120 hour work weeks over an entire month with the help of several of my hardworking teammates to pull this off. This was a huge part of my inspiration to start Workstream , which is a hiring and onboarding software to automate the above manual processes that I just shared.

Restaurants have long struggled with hiring and retaining hourly employees—even before the pandemic. But now we’re reaching all new lows… or highs, rather. Despite a 10% increase in hourly wages, many former restaurant employees have left the industry altogether. The ones that have stayed are turning over at 140%, the highest rate in two decades. There are many factors that are (and could be) playing into this, which makes the crisis so complicated. But, it doesn’t make the problem any less real for general managers and business owners who are trying to keep lights on. To keep stores staffed, many are calling upon family and friends to fill shifts. Complicating matters further is that GMs are also currently spending a lot of time covering shifts, which means they aren’t using that time to hire, grow the team, or improve the customer experience. Many QSRs are staffing at a burnout pace, and it comes at the price of overworking their GMs and team members, overspending on overtime, and under-delivering value to their customers. Traditional methods of finding and hiring employees no longer work. That’s why NRD Capital’s Fuzzy’s Taco and Frisch’s are taking the path that empowers them to secure interviews in under two hours. A Better, Faster Way to Hire—For Everyone “Here’s the thing. Managers have a lot of responsibilities on their plate: four walls, customers, employees, HR, hiring—they have a lot. We make it hard on them, but Workstream makes it easy,” said Kevin Rychel, VP of Operations for Fuzzy’s Taco Shop. For Rychel, the pressure placed on GMs to run successful restaurant operations and find good workers during the hiring crisis was becoming overwhelming. With more than 20 years of QSR experience, Rychel knew he couldn’t keep supporting the same hiring practices and processes and expect different results. So, he began looking into new solutions. He vetted 15 different hiring platforms and ultimately chose Workstream , a hiring platform and mobile app that uses automation and SMS text to streamline how QSRs source, screen, and onboard hourly workers. Fuzzy’s saw success immediately and has since rolled out Workstream to 47 locations. But the rollout didn’t end there. Fuzzy’s Taco Shop is owned by NRD Capital, a prominent middle market private equity firm that is known for innovative approaches to equity and venture investing.  During a business review between Fuzzy’s and NRD, Rychel informed the board about the success Fuzzy’s was having with Workstream.  Intrigued and impressed, NRD Capital’s team investigated further and concluded that it was time to recommend the adoption of Workstream’s cutting-edge platform across its other holdings starting with Frisch’s Restaurants. The Proof is in the Efficiency Using Workstream's hiring platform built on text automation, Fuzzy’s Taco is able to engage applicants as soon as they apply—without needing the GM to step away from running the restaurant. “The ability to talk to candidates almost immediately is incredible,” Rychel said. “Before Workstream, we had a lot of applicants, but by the time we got around to reviewing them, the applicants had already been sitting in the queue for three months. Someone else had hired them. Now, we can talk to applicants so quickly. It’s so fast that our district manager can get someone in for an interview in under two hours.” And in today’s hiring landscape, it’s all about speed. Why? Because the applicant that applied for a job likely also applied to work at five or six other places too. “We were losing on hiring because we didn’t respond to applicants fast enough,” said Darrin White, Frisch’s Chief Operating Officer. “GMs don’t have time to sit and respond to email, and when they do, it’s infrequent. Automating communication between us and the applicants increases our chances 10 to 1,” White said. Workstream takes the friction out of the hiring process for the applicant and the hiring manager. Applicants can apply for a job within a matter of seconds. Through Workstream’s automated SMS Text Messaging , a qualified candidate will then be prompted to schedule an interview and, from there, receive text reminders of their appointment (which minimizes ghosting). The GM, on the other hand, posts the job from their phone and takes interviews that appear on their calendar. Since implementing Workstream, Fuzzy’s hiring process has evolved, allowing GMs to focus more on running successful restaurants and less on back-and-forth phone calls with candidates and interview no-shows that were previously taking up so much of their valuable time. “When our GMs found out about Workstream, they kept asking how to get it,” said White. “Workstream gives GMs and district managers 2-3 hours back in their schedules daily.” By engaging applicants faster and minimizing the time managers spend on hiring, Fuzzy’s Taco and Frisch’s are becoming more efficient—and fully staffed. “All corporate locations are now 90% staffed, and that’s 100% because of Workstream. We were tapping family and friends, the neighbor’s kids. Now, we don't have to.” Now Is the Time to Lead With no end in sight to the current hiring crisis, QSRs are discovering that Workstream gives them a meaningful advantage over their competition. While competitors continue to struggle by using traditional hiring methods, NRD’s Fuzzy’s and Frisch’s are taking a giant leap forward in hiring and retaining the best workers in their geographic areas. For NRD Capital, however, implementing Workstream is about more than just getting ahead of today’s QSR hiring crisis. “Eventually, the staffing crisis will be less impactful than it is now—but we don’t know when that will be. Either way, we’re going to get ahead of the competition and take the lead by being a first adopter with Workstream,” said White.

In fact, according to CBS News , 40% of restaurants in the United States are having trouble finding servers, cooks, and other workers for their teams. Further complicating matters, restaurant leaders are facing the increasingly high employee turnover rates of the QSR industry. Restaurant Dive reported turnover rates as high as 200% for some QSRs. Finding—and hiring—talent for your restaurant is hard enough, but compounding those challenges with high turnover rates is leading some restaurants to reduce operating hours or, even worse, permanently close doors. With stakes as high as they’ve ever been, it’s more important than ever to take a look at your current hiring process and rid it of the common mistakes that will prevent you from building a solid team. Here’s a look at the top 5 QSR hiring mistakes and their remedies. 1. Not Leveraging Technology Many QSRs are still using outdated methods for finding and hiring employees. Many rely primarily on in-store posters or word-of-mouth to find new job candidates. Once a person applies, hiring managers often use back-and-forth phone calls to screen applicants and schedule interviews. All or parts of this process may have worked once upon a time, but the competitive landscape has changed. Relying on two primary drivers for applicants (in this case, posters and employee referrals) greatly limits your applicant flow. In today’s job market (especially given the high turnover rate), you need as much applicant flow as you can handle. You may be wondering how your hiring managers can take on more applicants. The answer: change the way you screen applicants and schedule interviews. With the right technology in place, your GMs won’t need to spend time on tasks that would historically take up a lot of time–like scheduling interviews. Using the right tools, you can get more eyes on your job posting, automatically engage and screen applicants, give employees the ability to schedule their interviews through their phone (which reduces ghosting), and ultimately free your GMs to focus more on the restaurant, the team, and the customer experience. 2. Not Performing Attitude Assessments Let’s say that you are (and you might be) in desperate need of a cook for your restaurant. You finally find a candidate that has five years of experience. During your interview with this candidate , you notice some tendencies that raise a few red flags, but you let your concerns go because you need an additional cook to cover shifts. You go ahead and hire this cook. Within the first month, you realize you’ve made a terrible decision. This cook is fueling negative attitudes throughout the kitchen, creating more problems and discord than you had before you made the hire. Hiring mistakes due to a lack of attitude assessments are all too common in the QSR industry. Many QSR hiring managers are overwhelmed trying to fill open positions that they deprioritize attitude assessments altogether. This is a big problem because attitude is one of the most important indicators of success—for your front-line workers and your restaurant. To address this head-on, build attitude assessments into your screening and interview process with a standard set of attitude-related questions . For example, ask candidates to describe a time their manager asked them to do a job they did not want to do and how they responded. You can then gauge their level of care and positive response to this situation in order to help you determine whether or not to move the candidate forward. 3. Not Having a Referral Program Think back over the last few years and really take notice of where your candidates came from. You’ll probably realize that many came from referrals from current employees and even job candidates. Generally speaking, if your employees are having a positive work experience at your restaurant, they will readily spread the word to their friends and family who are looking for a great place to work. And while you may be receiving great organic referrals from your employees already, make sure you’re incentivizing them to send more candidates your way. (For example, for each new employee that is hired from a referral and stays on for 60 days, you pay the referring employee $250.) Doing so will increase the quality and quantity of your applicants. It will also serve up candidates that will gel better with your team and create a positive work culture that encourages employees to stay around longer than the industry average. Maybe you already have a referral program. That’s great. Perhaps this is an opportunity for you to level up how it’s managed. One way to do this is to automate your referral program , making it easier for your employees to share the open role with their networks and refer candidates to you. The compounding effect of using technology for your referral program is tremendous. By leveraging next-generation referral technology, you’ll reach a larger audience much more easily. 4. Not Diversifying Your Job Board Platforms Are you still using the same online job board to post your open positions that you were using five years ago? Or, perhaps you’re not using online job boards at all and instead, you’re opting for signage on your restaurant’s property or local job fairs as a means to finding new employees. While time-tested online job boards such as Monster.com are still valuable in today’s job marketplace, there are now many more online job boards and channels than ever before. QSRs are even finding recent success with using social media platforms such as Facebook and TikTok to find new candidates. If you’re still using only one or two online job boards, you are missing out on an increasing number of new applicants who have moved on to other channels where you do not have an online presence. Don’t miss out any longer. Pro Tip: Posting job openings on multiple job boards can be time-consuming—and so can managing all the incoming inquiries. Find a platform to help you do it all through one interface. 5. Poor Job Descriptions One of the biggest roadblocks to getting responses to your job postings is poorly written job descriptions. The descriptions that accompany your job postings are the first impression candidates get of your team and your operation. Many GMs and hiring managers are so busy that they just copy and paste generic job descriptions on all of their postings. Unfortunately, this mistake results in postings that are unpersuasive to candidates. Candidates are increasingly inundated with generic job advertisements online—all the time. It’s imperative that your job postings are written in a way that they rise above all the noise. If you’re pressed for time, consider hiring a copywriter to write your job postings. A small investment in high-quality copywriting can end up producing significant long-term financial rewards for your business that comes from attracting top-notch talent.

You may have encountered one or more of the following problems: Insufficient applicants, yet a need to hire quickly (and seasonally) Inefficient hiring processes Difficulties in onboarding and training High turnovers … and on top of it all, ensuring that your hiring processes abide by the new Covid-19 protocols, which are likely here to stay. We hear your struggles, and are here to help. A strategic hiring process is key and may be the deciding factor that makes or breaks your business. That being said, we've narrowed down a list of tips and tricks that aim to tackle these problems, and (hopefully) make your QSR journey a lot less painful than before. 1. Cast a Wide Net Challenge: Insufficient applicants, yet a need to hire quickly (and seasonally) As a hiring manager, especially for QSRs, you may often find yourself struggling to hire quickly (especially during peak periods across the different seasons), and the low applicant numbers aren't helping. Managers end up having to work on the front lines, taking up multiple roles to make up for the lack of manpower, on top of their usual duties. It is therefore important to first cast a net that is wide enough , to secure a large pool of candidates. How can this be done? You should first ensure that your brand is visible on as many job boards as possible. With Workstream's job board integrations , you can post to 25,000 job boards with a single click instead of copying and pasting job descriptions multiple times. The best part? All applicants can still be viewed within the same dashboard! Furthermore, the smart sponsorship feature utilizes AI to optimize job postings, putting your brand in front of 10x as many job seekers . Additionally, it is key to make your job convenient for applicants to apply. This will automatically increase the applicant pool, as people are often hesitant to apply when too many processes or steps are involved. Perhaps consider using text-to-apply posters , where custom posters can be printed out and displayed in multiple outlets. Visitors will only need to scan the QR code, or text the number displayed, to get a link to all open positions, kickstarting their application process. 2. Embrace Technology and Automate your Hiring Process Challenge: Inefficient hiring processes You now have a number of new applicants. What next? Sometimes, the number of applicants start to get overwhelming, and hiring managers find themselves flooded with resumes. Not only is it time consuming to look through every single resume, you may also start losing track of the status of each application. This is where an automated hiring process comes in handy. By investing in a robust hiring platform , you will then be able to gain access to technology-driven hiring systems that make the hiring process easier and a lot more efficient. Firstly, a streamlined feed ensures that all of your applicants and currently employees are within the same dashboard and mobile application. From new applicants, to referrals and even existing employees, keep track of all your staff and hiring processes with ease. The workflows of job postings can also be customized, allowing you to determine the stages and whether candidates can automatically move on to the next stage. Easily review and recommend candidates, while adding on interview and training notes for ease of reference. Next comes the screening process. You may request for candidates to send in video resumes , a quick video introducing themselves, which allow hiring managers to easily determine who is genuinely interested in a particular position, instead of reading through endless resumes. Automated scheduling further reduces the time spent in the hiring process, as candidates that make it to the next stage instantly get a text message link to the hiring manager's Workstream calendar, which can be integrated to their own Google or Outlook calendar, to schedule a meeting based on their availability. No more back-and-forth calls and emails! Reminders are also sent to reduce ghosting - and candidates can even reschedule their interviews, should they be unavailable at the last minute. 3. Work Smart Challenge: High Turnovers When you've secured a new hire, the last thing you want is for them to quit the job after a couple of days, which effectively restarts the painful hiring cycle all over again. Sadly, the QSR industry is known for its high turnover rates, and it is inevitable. But this doesn't mean you can't do anything to minimize it! Prevention is better than cure, and working smart, quite literally, means utilizing smart screening to ensure that you hire candidates that are the best fit for your team. By setting up multiple choice questions and automating scoring, you will be able to weed out candidates who may not be suitable, such as those looking for a short stint, or with limited working experience in the QSR industry. Only qualified candidates will move forward to the interview. Thereafter, data-driven analytics will also allow you to track retention rates by applicant source. Effectively identify opportunities to reduce spend, while recognizing the platforms that provide long term hires. It is also crucial that you create a fun working environment , such that all staff are motivated and enjoy what they do. Look into cross-training employees for multiple roles, as it reduces job boredom, while at the same time leaves room for reallocation of employees in the event that someone calls in sick for work at the last minute. Be organized and respect your employees' time, by posting shift schedules ahead of time, and reducing the instances of sudden changes. Recognize the efforts of your employees , through awards and incentives - such as 'staff of the month', while also rewarding them with things they actually want . 4. Optimize your Onboarding Challenge: Complicated (physical) onboarding and training With many new hires and onboarding documents across different locations, it may be difficult to consolidate the various materials required for onboarding and training. Having physical onboarding materials also means a higher possibility of losing important documentation. To make things simpler, why not consider mobile onboarding and training ? Hire in seconds through easily accessible onboarding, with pre-made templates and documents that can be authorized with e-signatures, and uploaded conveniently. Furthermore, trigger alerts will be sent to signal incomplete paperwork, which means no more worrying over missing personal information when the time comes. Additionally, you can easily authenticate a candidate's eligibility, through background check vendors, e-signature services and payroll platforms, which help in optimizing efficiency. With mobile training, send all training resources (such as handbooks, checklists and training videos) through a text message link to all employees. This link is accessible anytime, anywhere - and the HR team will also be able to instantly review completion rates, with SMS reminders sent out to guarantee completion. 5. Stay Safe while Striving Towards the New Normal Challenge: Ensuring that hiring processes abide by the new Covid-19 protocols The good news is that this isn't even an additional step, as all processes mentioned above are fully online! However, there are a few additional measures you can take, to be extra safe. Instead of holding physical interviews, schedule video interviews with potential candidates. Automatically set virtual interviews into your hiring stages, without the need for manual edits. We understand that this may not be easy, considering that it is a service-intensive job after all, and many physical cues are missing in video interviews. However, you may consider leaving the physical interview to the last stage of the hiring process, to minimize physical contact, while still being able to meet the candidate at least once. Workstream also makes it easy for mobile training to take place - conveniently send training videos, slides and quizzes that can be accessed by applicants anytime via their smartphones.

Employees, especially millennials and Gen Zers, no longer join a company and commit to it until retirement like many baby boomers did. While baby boomers stayed with their employers for an average of 20 years, the new generation of employees tends to stay at a company for about two years before hopping to their next gig. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , that’s an average of 11.7 jobs in their lifetime. To add to this, 27% of this new workforce changes jobs every year, earning the ultimate job hopper crown. Recruiters, as you can imagine, face a lot of hiring challenges with “job hoppers.” They prefer to hire employees who will stay with the company for an extended amount of time. After all, it saves and makes the company money—it reduces the amount spent on hiring a backfill, harnesses institutional knowledge and preserves productivity. So, how do you hire a workforce that will help your business be profitable (and mitigate the expenses listed above)? The trick is finding candidates that have specific traits beyond the functional and process capabilities that the job description calls for. Here are the five core areas you should focus on to find the best, most committed employees. 1. Alignment to Company Mission Millennials, but in reality, all employees, feel the need to work for an organization that is making a meaningful difference in the world. Not all organizations are non-profits—and that’s ok, even for Millennials. If you’re a for-profit business, the profit you make serves as an indication of the value you are contributing to society. Clearly communicate the value your business is delivering, and see how your candidate responds. If the candidate shows an interest and active participation in helping you and your team achieve that higher calling, you’re on the right track. 2. Attitude Toward Team Work If the role you’re hiring for requires team collaboration, pay close attention to signs that will indicate how well your candidate will work with your team. It’s better to have a moderate performer who’s an outstanding team player than an outstanding solo performer who doesn’t work well on a team. Ask the candidate questions to see how they would respond in different team scenarios to see if they’re the right fit. 3. Growth Mindset If the last year has taught us anything, it’s that we need to be adaptable—and that only comes from our willingness to learn and change. This applies to business processes, customer requirements and even our responsibilities. It's important for your organization to be agile and for every new employee to be flexible, quickly adaptable, and most importantly, an active learner. That may also mean that they need to be comfortable with failing—and failing fast. Introducing new products, services and approaches will not be easy, but if your candidate shows a willingness to do their best, learn along the way, share their ideas and remain open to the ideas of others, take note. 4. Problem-Solving Skills A related yet different capability is that of problem solving. In fast-paced environments, especially when working directly with customers, it’s important that each member of your team is able to autonomously solve problems. In the hospitality industry, a large part of your offering is service, so you want team members who can deliver the best experience by coming up with effective solutions on the fly. 5. Strong Work Ethic Last but not least, work ethic . The restaurant industry today—more than ever—needs reliable people. People who will show up for their shifts. People who are committed to making sure the customer experience is a top priority. Talk to your candidate to better understand how reliable they are and how they handle common situations they’ll face day-to-day. Choosing quality hires is critical. It’s also challenging. And although this isn’t a comprehensive list of the qualities you should be looking for when finding the right candidate, these five traits are early indicators of a strong and committed hire. Understanding Commitment in the Workplace So we've discussed the vital traits that define committed employees: alignment with the company's mission, a positive attitude toward teamwork , a growth mindset, problem-solving skills, and a strong work ethic . These traits are indeed the bedrock of an employee who will stand the test of time in your organization. However, it's essential to delve deeper into what commitment level in the workplace actually means and how you can identify and nurture it. Below, we explore various aspects of job commitment , offering insights into how employees feel about their jobs and the benefits that come from a committed workforce. How do you say you are committed to your job? To express that you're committed to your job, you can go beyond stating it directly and demonstrate it through your actions. Show up on time, be proactive, and communicate openly with co-workers and supervisors. Human resources often appreciate when an employee takes the time to get involved in career development opportunities or even mentorship programs. Your level of commitment also shines through when you are willing to put in hard work and go the extra mile , displaying a positive attitude even in challenging situations. These are signs of work commitment that employers value highly. What is an example of committed at work? A good example of being committed at work could be an employee who voluntarily undertakes additional responsibilities to help a project meet its deadline. This shows a high level of commitment to the team's success and the work environment as a whole. This kind of affective commitment and feeling of responsibility can be contagious, improving overall employee engagement and retention rates. How do you become committed to work? Becoming committed to work is a multi-step process. It starts with aligning your personal values with your job title and the mission of the company. This fosters a sense of belonging and increases your job satisfaction . Building positive relationships with co-workers also adds to your level of commitment . Time management and balance between personal life and work are essential too. Engage in employee surveys and feedback sessions to understand how you can contribute more effectively. Lastly, ongoing career advancement and the acquisition of new skills can help sustain your commitment in the workplace over the long term. What are the benefits of a committed employee? Committed employees offer numerous advantages to an organization. Their hard work and positive attitude contribute significantly to job performance . They usually have better management skills and exhibit a strong feeling of responsibility toward their roles. A committed employee is also less prone to burnout , as their well-being is often higher due to a balanced work-life scenario. From the perspective of human resources , high levels of employee commitment are a boon. They positively impact retention rates and even pave the way for career development within the company. Moreover, these employees often become the face of the organization on social media , sharing their positive experiences and further enhancing the company's reputation. In summary, a committed employee benefits not just themselves but the entire work environment , from human resources to co-workers . Their affective and normative commitment to the role enhances their job satisfaction , and by extension, their overall well-being . Through a combination of factors like career development opportunities, job satisfaction , and a sense of belonging , committed employees contribute significantly to the success of any organization.
