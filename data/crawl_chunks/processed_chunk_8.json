That's what screening processes can feel like - time-consuming and daunting. But here's where smart screening comes in, turning the process into a magnet pulling out those needles with ease. In the same way I once found myself overwhelmed at a bustling farmer’s market, struggling to choose ripe tomatoes amongst an array of options. The solution was simpler than expected: learning how to assess their firmness and color efficiently. This is what smart screening offers – it simplifies complexity.

It's not just about picking out resumes anymore; it's more akin to using a sieve to filter the best candidates. The process starts with what we call ' tenant screening .' Here, background checks are crucial for ensuring safety within your establishment. Did you know that 80% of these results can be obtained in less than 24 hours? That’s right. A simple yet efficient tool helps businesses make informed decisions swiftly. This doesn't stop at potential employees either. In property management companies, smart screening plays an important role too. By looking into credit scores or eviction reports before making leasing decisions, they ensure only reliable tenants get through their doors. In essence, smart screening is like having a guard dog on duty – always alert and ready to protect your interests from potential threats. You may be wondering, how does this process operate? Components of an Effective Smart Screening Process Smart screening is a vital part of decision-making processes in various sectors, from property management companies to the restaurant and hospitality industries. It's not just about conducting background checks or pulling up credit reports; it’s more complex and detailed. Criminal Background Checks for Safety An effective smart screening process begins with comprehensive criminal background checks . This isn't only important for safety but also compliance with licensing requirements. With access to over 800 databases, ranging from government agencies to educational organizations, we can obtain essential information quickly thanks to background screening . These thorough tenant screening reports reveal potential red flags that might impact leasing decisions such as past evictions or severe financial instability indicated by poor credit scores . A deep dive into these aspects helps ensure you’re inviting reliable tenants into your properties who will respect rules and pay on time. Tenant Credit Reports for Financial Stability A significant component of smart screening involves reviewing applicant’s credit history through detailed credit reports. Such measures help ascertain if they're financially responsible enough to meet rent payments without hassle, thereby making sure you have great tenants every time. Incorporating these key components makes the overall hiring or rental process seamless while providing landlords and employers alike invaluable peace-of-mind knowing their choices are based on factual data rather than mere intuition. And remember: knowledge isn’t just power—it's also protection. The Impact of Smart Screening on Restaurant and Hospitality Industries Smart screening has revolutionized the hiring process in many industries, but its impact is particularly significant in restaurants and hospitality. With smart screening for restaurant staff, businesses can make more informed decisions when choosing their team members. In a hustling and bustling setting like a restaurant or hotel, it's critical to recruit dependable people who can keep up with the demand. A smart screening service allows these establishments to conduct thorough background checks and credit reports swiftly - something that's becoming increasingly important as employers look for ways to mitigate risk. By using smart screening solutions designed specifically for hotels, property management companies are better equipped to evaluate potential employees' suitability quickly and accurately. These tools often include comprehensive criminal background checks which offer insights into an applicant’s past behavior patterns—crucial information when making staffing decisions in sectors where trustworthiness is paramount. The importance of this technology extends beyond initial hiring too; ongoing employee assessments are made simpler through the use of sophisticated algorithms capable of detecting subtle changes over time. This enables managers not only to select great tenants initially but also to monitor their performance effectively throughout their tenure. No longer just an optional tool, smart screening has become essential within today’s competitive business landscape - particularly so within dynamic sectors such as restaurant and hospitality where employee turnover rates tend to be high due to inherent industry challenges. Seamless Integration of Smart Screening into Operations In the dynamic world of hospitality and restaurant businesses, incorporating smart screening can significantly streamline operations. But how does this integration work? Phishing Attacks and Scam Sites One key area where smart screening shines is in protecting against online threats like phishing attacks and scam sites. When implemented correctly, it acts as a reliable warning system. The process begins with your operating system. Modern systems have built-in mechanisms that let you integrate smart screening tools without a hitch. The result? Your data stays safe from potential security vulnerabilities. MDM provides a way to easily manage network access and retain licensing rights, which is essential for businesses like hotels or restaurants that need to run large-scale operations. MDM solutions allow for seamless control over network shares while maintaining license entitlements - crucial elements when running large-scale operations such as restaurants or hotels. Fighting Back Against Phishers Avoiding phishing attacks isn't just about technology; it's about educating employees too. Training staff to recognize potential threats helps reinforce your technological defenses. Here, you'll find more on handling disputes related to these issues. Comparison of Smart Screening Services The world of smart screening is vast, with numerous service providers offering unique features and pricing. Let's explore the leading smart screening services . Integration and Compatibility of Services When selecting a smart screening service provider, consider their integration capabilities. Some services offer seamless integration into existing systems which can greatly simplify operations for property management companies. User reviews are another critical aspect to examine. It’s one thing to hear about great reports from the company itself, but quite another when real users testify about their experiences with these screening solutions . Credit checks are integral in tenant screening processes . While some services may provide basic credit report data, others delve deeper by providing detailed tenant credit reports along with income insights - an invaluable tool in making leasing decisions. A common concern among potential clients pertains to how smart screen helps protect against security vulnerabilities like phishing attacks or scam sites targeting your operating system or network shares. Top-notch providers incorporate robust warning systems designed specifically for this purpose. Best Practices for Implementing Smart Screening Smart screening has been revolutionizing the restaurant and hospitality sectors. To get the most out of it, there are best practices you should follow. Establishing Screening Policies and Procedures The beginning step is to build up definite principles and systems. It's important to set expectations right from the start - what information will be checked? What standards must be met? Your policy needs to ensure consistency while complying with Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) guidelines . You don't want your smart screening process turning into a legal minefield. Training Staff on Using Smart Screening Tools You can have all the tools in the world, but they're useless if your team doesn't know how to use them effectively. Training sessions can help everyone understand how these systems work, their benefits, as well as potential pitfalls. Maintaining Data Privacy Last but not least: data privacy. Maintaining the trust between those who are in charge and those they oversee is just as vital as following laws about data privacy. All collected information should remain confidential unless required by law or explicitly agreed upon beforehand. Future Trends in Smart Screening A look into the future trends in smart screening including artificial intelligence, machine learning, enhanced data analytics among others. Automation of Screening Processes How automation is streamlining the screening processes making it more efficient. The future of smart screening is being shaped by groundbreaking technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and enhanced data analytics. These tech advancements are set to streamline the screening processes , making them more efficient than ever before. Innovations like AI are paving the way for a new era in smart screening . AI can analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, identifying patterns that humans might miss. This could be game-changing in industries such as property management or hospitality where quick yet informed decisions need to be made regularly. Machine learning, another exciting development on the horizon, promises even more precision and efficiency. It's expected to refine our ability to predict behavior based on historical trends; this will prove invaluable when evaluating potential tenants or employees. Data analytics also play a pivotal role in enhancing our understanding of behaviors and trends associated with different individuals or groups. As we gather more granular insights into various factors – from credit scores to criminal backgrounds - it becomes easier for businesses to make sound judgments based on comprehensive information rather than gut feeling alone. All these developments point towards an increasingly automated future where smart screening isn't just faster but smarter too. We're looking at not only better tenant selection but improved overall operational efficiency across sectors. Conclusion No longer a mere convenience, smart screening is now an absolute necessity. It brings efficiency to the hiring and leasing process, ensuring safety and making informed decisions easier. In property management or hospitality services, you'll find great tenants or trustworthy staff with ease. No more sifting through haystacks for that elusive needle! Remember though - not all smart screening solutions are created equal. Pick one that aligns with your needs: integration capabilities, compliance programs and user reviews matter. Above all else – be ready for change! Automation in smart screening processes isn't just coming; it’s already here. Make sure you're prepared to embrace this shift towards convenience while still keeping an eye on security vulnerabilities.

However, it’s more than just choosing the right team members . You have to properly introduce them to your company and their new roles . And how do you do that? With proper onboarding. Onboarding is arguably the most important part of the hiring process . It’s what assimilates new hires into your team and prepares them for their new roles . It takes new hires between eight and twelve months from their start date to be as efficient as an experienced coworker . If you want to cut that time down as much as possible, it’s all about efficient onboarding. Here are some employee onboarding process best practices to help you create an efficient team. What is employee onboarding? Employee onboarding is the process in which you integrate new hires into your organization. The process can cover many activities and take anywhere from a few weeks to many months, depending on your organization and the role. It’s not uncommon for people to confuse employee orientation with employee onboarding, although they’re both very different. Orientation is a part of the onboarding process . It typically consists of paperwork and routine new-hire tasks, typically lasting just a couple of hours. If your onboarding process is a one-day orientation, you’ve done something wrong! A proper employee onboarding process should last much longer and consist of many different activities, including: Touring the facilities Meeting department heads and coworkers Covering basic tasks and responsibilities Completing paperwork Regular follow-ups over a period of time With a proper onboarding procedure, new hires will be ready to be productive members of your team in no time! Why is onboarding so important? Onboarding is more than important; it’s essential if you want your team to thrive! First and foremost, onboarding prepares new hires for their roles and responsibilities in the workplace. It also acclimates them to the work environment and their coworkers . When a new hire isn’t onboarded properly in the first week , not only do they feel unprepared for the work, but they also don’t enjoy the work, meaning they’re more likely to leave. It costs approximately $1,500 to hire and onboard a new employee . That means if you don’t properly onboard new hires , you might have to spend that $1,500 pretty often! According to research, businesses with strong onboarding processes increase their employee retention rates by 82% and increase productivity by 70%. All of those amazing numbers are because the new hires are adequately prepared and feel comfortable in their new roles . That’s the power of proper onboarding! Employee onboarding process best practices With all the talk of the power of onboarding, what goes into a “proper” employee onboarding process flow? Well, a flow is exactly what it is! You need to take employees from hire to working smoothly and gradually, so they feel prepared for their new role . Did you know that only 12% of employees feel like their company did a good job with onboarding? If you want more success (and you do!), here are the steps of a successful onboarding employee process to help you increase employee retention and boost overall productivity: Pre-boarding That’s right; the onboarding process begins before the onboarding! Proper onboarding can bring serious benefits to your business, that’s why it’s important to take it seriously! Pre-boarding is the process that begins after the offer is accepted but before the new hire ’s official first day . These first few days are great for getting the ball rolling and ensuring an efficient and effective onboarding process . Typically, pre-boarding consists of activities that prepare the new hire for working at your company: Facility tours (including the family is a big bonus, especially if relocation is involved) Emailing essential information, including benefits packages, background about the company and its culture, organizational charts, any check-in information. etc. Matching the new hire with a buddy, so they can talk to each other before the official first day of work and answer basic questions. Sending a care package with logoed gear, treats, or anything else you want to welcome the new employee to your team. Preboarding is a great way to show new hires that they’re welcome and that you’re excited for them to be a part of your team. It can get new employees excited for their first day and other team members ready to show them the company culture . It makes them feel welcome and starts the entire relationship off on the right foot. Orientation Orientation is the step of the employee onboarding process that many companies confuse with the entire process. However, it’s just that: a single step! Orientation is typically the new hire ’s very first day and may take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. It involves all the mandatory HR processes, paperwork, and meet-and-greet activities to prepare the new employee for real work: Introduce new hire to organization’s structure, mission, vision, and values Distribute (if you didn’t during pre-boarding ) and review the employee handbook Highlight essential policies for working at your company Review administrative procedures Sign essential paperwork Provide any mandatory training Because orientation is such an information-heavy part of employee onboarding , it’s a good idea to spread it out over a few days to prevent overload. You don’t want to scare your new hires away on their first day ! Building a foundation Every business is different. Even if your new hire has a hundred years of industry experience (lucky you!), it doesn’t mean they’ve encountered anything like your company in their past. To help guide them into your operation, you should first build a foundation. Just like when constructing a house, building a foundation first is essential for any new employee onboarding process . Over the first few days to weeks of employment, continuously discuss and showcase your company’s culture , mission, and value propositions. Since the orientation process is so information-heavy, new hires likely won’t pick up all the minor details in just that time alone. It takes weeks to months of constant, yet gentle, reminders for these ideals to be absorbed. According to Gallup, there are five questions your onboarding program should make clear during the building a foundation step: What do we believe in around here? What are my strengths? What is my role? Who are my partners? What does my future look like here? Think of these as the bricks you use to build the onboarding foundation. And the more “concrete” you make these blocks, the more ready the new hire will be to take on their new role . It’s all about setting clear (and realistic) expectations. Ensuring your new hires understand their role and your company’s core values will help them more easily assimilate into the workforce. Buddy systems and mentoring Who could be better to introduce new employees to their work environment day one than someone who already works there? Buddy systems and mentoring are tactics used by many companies as a part of the onboarding employee process. With a buddy system, you pair your new hire with an existing employee — typically someone at a similar level. Try to pair your new employee with someone who isn’t in a position of direct authority, but rather someone who can show them the ropes and point them in the right direction if they have questions without intimidating. The buddy or mentor is typically responsible for simple tasks, like showing the new hire around, telling them who to talk to when resolving problems, where to park, the best places for lunch, and the more subtle nuances of working for the company. Buddies can be paired with new hires anywhere from a few weeks up to a year — or whatever timeline works for your organization’s onboarding process . Ideally, your new hire and their buddy can form a close work relationship, which they can both use in the future. It makes the new hire feel welcome and your existing employee feel valued. Win, win! Because of the benefits, 56% of new hires say they prefer the buddy system as a part of the employee onboarding process to mentor them as they start their new job . Track the right metrics One major part of the onboarding experience doesn’t even have anything to do with the new hire . It’s up to your HR team ! The only way to tell if your employee onboarding process was a success is if you track the right metrics . By tracking key onboarding metrics , you can identify areas of improvement to help future new hires become productive members of your team even better! Here are just a few onboarding metrics your HR team should be aware of: Time-to-productivity – How long does it take for new hires to contribute to the organization? This may differ between positions, so determine average times for various departments, and compare new hire times against the benchmarks. Turnover and retention rates – How long do employees stay at your company? If you have high turnover rates, it could indicate a problem with your onboarding processes . Performance measures – Track average performance between groups. For example, compare how well a group performs after one week of onboarding versus a group with one month of onboarding. It’s also a good idea to get in the habit of asking new hires what they thought of your onboarding processes . They went through it, so they could have valuable insights your team might have overlooked. You can do this with formal surveys or informally by just asking them questions. Effective employee onboarding procedures lead to effective employees No matter what project you take on, it’s important to get a good start. And that’s exactly what your onboarding employee process is: a start. It’s up to you whether it’s a good one or not! If you want new hires to become productive members of your team, proper onboarding is crucial. Take your time to develop your employee onboarding process flow and prepare new hires for working at your company. The more prepared they feel, the faster they’ll contribute to your organization and higher your retention rates .

It allows them to manage the recruitment process more efficiently and effectively. In this guide, we’ll provide a comprehensive overview of what an ATS is and how it can be used to streamline the hiring process . We’ll also discuss some of the key features you should look for when choosing an ATS . So, if you’re looking to improve your recruitment process , read on! What is an applicant tracking system ? An applicant tracking system is a recruitment software application that helps hiring managers in the recruitment process . It’s designed to streamline how companies collect, sort, and track job applications . ATS can be used to track all aspects of the recruitment process , from initial job postings to final applicant selections. It’s an efficient system for both human resources departments looking for employees and job seekers looking for an work. How do applicant tracking systems work ? There is no singular ATS that all businesses use. Applicant tracking systems work in different ways depending on the specific software. However, most applicant tracking systems share some common features and functions . These common features include: Data storage Perhaps the most foundational function of an ATS solution is the storage of applicant information. ATS software is designed to collect and organize applicant data. This data can include everything from contact information, work history, resumes , and cover letters . Applicant tracking systems typically allow employers to search this data using keywords or other criteria. This makes it easier to find qualified applicants when needed. Screening Being able to effectively screen potential applicants is vital when handling large numbers of applications which means it's important that your applicant tracking system has robust screening capabilities. These features should include: Smart-screening questions Smart-screening questions are mandatory questions within your application that enable you to automatically reject unqualified applicants. Formatting a smart-screening template can really speed this process up and help with scheduling interviews . Eligibility parameters Eligibility parameters help you identify applicants who meet the minimum requirements for the position like \"years of experience\" or \"education level.\" Skill testing Some applicant tracking systems have built-in tests that allow you to assess an applicant’s skills and abilities. These can be helpful for positions that require specific technical skills. Resume ranking functionality Another vital function that you can expect from your ATS is the ability to rank resumes . Applicants who have applied for a job through an ATS will have their resumes automatically stored in the system. This software will then use predetermined criteria to rank each resume . This criterion can be based on how well the resume stacks up to the job description and requirements. The ATS will also consider things like the applicant's work experience , education, and skills. By ranking resumes , the ATS can help you quickly identify the most qualified applicants for a job. This is a huge time saver as you no longer have to manually review each and every resume that comes in. Tracking Any decent tracking software should provide you with some basic tracking functionality . This includes things like the ability to track how many resumes have been received, how many candidates have been contacted, and how many interviews have been scheduled. This information can be extremely valuable, as it can help you gauge the effectiveness of your recruiting efforts. For example, if you're not receiving many qualified resumes , you may need to adjust your job postings . Or, if you're finding that most applicants are rejected after the first interview, you may want to reconsider your interviewing process. Automation Finally, you can expect your ATS to automate some of the more tedious and time-consuming aspects of recruiting. This can include everything from posting job openings on your website to sending automatic email responses to applicants. By automating these tasks, your ATS can save you a considerable amount of time and effort. This allows you to focus on more important things, like meeting with applicants and making hiring decisions. What are the benefits of using an ATS ? Employers and recruiters have been utilizing ATS for years. The best applicant tracking systems have several key benefits: Timesaving Perhaps the main advantage of using an ATS is that it can save you a considerable amount of time and effort. By automating repetitive tasks, an ATS can free up your time so that you can focus on more important things like meeting with applicants and making hiring decisions. Improved organization Another benefit of using an ATS is that it can help you to better organize your recruitment process . An ATS can store all your applicant information in one centralized location, which makes it easy to keep track of things. Additionally, an ATS can automate things like job postings and email responses which further help to improve how you organize your hiring efforts. Higher quality hires Because an ATS can rank resumes and track applicant information, it can help you to identify the best candidates for a job. This, in turn, can lead to higher-quality hires and eventually gets you to more employee referrals which are always a life-saver. Increased applicant engagement Finding great applicants isn't worth much if you can't get them to apply for your open positions . However, an ATS can help with this by automatically posting your job openings to multiple job boards and websites. This helps to increase the visibility of your open positions and, as a result, can lead to increased applicant engagement. Improved compliance If you're using an ATS , you can be sure that your recruitment process is compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. This is because an ATS can help you to avoid things like discrimination and applicant privacy issues. Keep up with the competition An applicant tracking system is almost mandatory if you and your hiring teams want to keep up with the competition. This is because more and more employers are using an ATS to streamline their recruitment process . Failure to use an ATS will mean you'll likely be at a disadvantage when competing for real-time top talent , and it can close you off from great hiring opportunities. Improve efficiency One of the main goals of using an applicant tracking system is to improve the efficiency metrics of your recruitment process . An ATS can help you to achieve this by automating repetitive tasks and storing applicant information in one centralized location. This makes it easy to find the information you need when you need it, which can save you a lot of time and effort. Reduced costs Finally, you can expect to see a reduction in costs when using an applicant tracking system . As you improve efficiency and cut out much of the unnecessary busy work, you free up time and money that can be spent on more important things like training your staff. What are the features of an ATS ? When it comes to applicant tracking systems , there is a wide range of features you can expect. The specific features offered by an ATS will vary depending on the system you're using. However, some common features are offered by most applicant tracking systems , including: Resume screening A feature you can expect with just about any ATS is the ability to screen resumes . This will allow you to filter out resumes that don't match the criteria you need. This filter may be done based on the job description or other screening factors like smart-screening questions. Why this matters: When advertising a role, it's very possible to receive dozens, if not hundreds, of applications. Going through each application manually would be hugely time-consuming . Applicant tracking systems give you the ability to screen resumes quickly and easily. Removing applications that aren't a good match right away means you can focus your time on the most qualified applicants. Keywords A keyword feature allows you to parse through resumes and identify which ones contain the keywords you're looking for. These features also allow you to use negative keywords to avoid looking at resumes that include a keyword you aren't interested in. Why this matters: Many applicant tracking systems now use some form of artificial intelligence (AI) to help screen resumes . However, these systems are still only as good as the keywords you input. This means that it's still important for you to carefully consider the keywords you're using. You'll want to use both positive and negative keywords to make sure you're getting the most accurate results possible. Filters A filtering feature lets you narrow down the pool of applicants by specifying certain criteria. For example, you may want to only look at applicants who can work nights or who live within a certain radius of the job location. Why this matters: The filtering feature is one of the most powerful features offered by applicant tracking systems . It's great for categorizing types of applications as well as finding the very best match for a job opening . Automated emails One feature that applicant tracking systems offer is the ability to automate email communications. This means you can set up automatic responses after you receive a resume , when an applicant moves to the next stage of the process, and so on. Why this matters: Automated email communications can help to keep your applicants updated on the status of their applications as well as the next steps they should expect. This can be a great way to improve communication and keep your applicants informed throughout the process. Advanced analytics Some applicant tracking systems also offer advanced analytics features. This can include things like being able to see what sources your best applicants are coming from or predicting how long it will take to fill a role. Why this matters: Advanced analytics can be a helpful way to get insights into your recruiting process . This information can be used to improve your process as well as make more informed decisions about your hiring. CRM software Many applicant tracking systems have a CRM (customer relationship management) software built into the system. This allows you to engage your potential applicants directly via the system rather than needing to rely on external tools like email. Why this matters: CRM software can be a great way to keep track of your potential applicants and engage with them directly. This can help you build relationships and keep your applicants interested in the role and ensures communication lines never fall through the cracks. The last thing you want is to miss out on a great applicant because you forgot to respond to an email. Applicant sourcing An applicant sourcing feature allows you to retain information and data from potential candidates during the application process even if they don't get offered the role for which they originally applied. This allows you to grow your talent pool and contact individuals for future roles that may be a better match. Why this matters: Not every good applicant will get the job. But that doesn’t mean you can’t hire them later for a different role. Applicant sourcing features allow you to build a pool of potentially great candidates who may be perfect for an upcoming position. These tools are also built with compliance in mind since data storage is a sensitive issue. Integrations The best ATS should be able to integrate with your existing HR software. This allows you to have all your applicant data in one place and makes it easy to keep track of. Why this matters: Having a system that can integrate with your other HR software is important for keeping all of your applicant data in one place. This can make it easier to keep track of and ensure that you're not duplicating data entry. Onboarding Finally, many applicant tracking systems offer an onboarding feature. This means that you can use the system to help new hires get acclimated to their new role and company. This can include things like collecting new hire paperwork, setting up training programs, or sending out welcome emails. Why this matters: Onboarding is an important part of the recruiting process and can help ensure new hires are successful in their roles. Having a system that can help with this can be a great way to improve your onboarding process. Drawbacks of using an ATS While ATS software is a fantastic tool to help recruiters and employers bring in talent, there are a few potential drawbacks to using applicant tracking systems . Cost The cost of the software, as well as the subscription fees, can add up quickly. Additionally, applicant tracking systems can require a significant time and resource investment to set up and maintain. Complexity Applicant tracking systems can be complex and require a certain level of technical expertise to set up and use. This can make it difficult for small businesses and startups to get started using applicant tracking systems . Inaccurate results Algorithms are not perfect. When your applicant tracking system uses a less reliable algorithm to select applicants, you may mistake a well- qualified candidate for a less qualified one. This can lead to good applicants slipping through the cracks and a potentially bad candidate experience . Lack of human touch Because ATS programs are automated, they lack the human touch that is so important in the hiring process . This can lead to a feeling of disconnection between applicants and employers. This could also lead applicants to feel disconnected from your business. Similarly, you may end up with an applicant who is good on paper but clashes with the ethos and culture of your company. ATS is becoming more and more commonplace in the recruiting landscape. However, it's important to be aware of the potential drawbacks of using applicant tracking systems before deciding whether to use one or not. How accurate are applicant tracking systems ? As it stands, an ATS system is very accurate when you account for just how much data they work through. They can help narrow down an applicant pool to a manageable list of qualified candidates in a relatively short amount of time. However, there are a couple of caveats. Firstly, they struggle to differentiate between similar candidates. This is because ATS are automated systems that rely on algorithms to sort and select candidates. These algorithms are not perfect and can sometimes make mistakes. This can lead to good applicants being overlooked or even rejected outright. Secondly, ATS are not human and cannot replace the personal touch that is so important in recruiting. They can help narrow down an applicant pool and save time, but they should not be used as a replacement for human interaction. They cannot interview applicants, nor can they assess competence or character. Finally, the results you get are only as good as the data you input. This means that applicant tracking systems can only be as accurate as the information you give them. If there are errors in your data, the applicant tracking system will make errors in its assessment . For these reasons, it's important to use applicant tracking systems as one part of your recruiting process . They can be valuable tools, but they should not be the only tool you use. Applicant tracking systems should be used in conjunction with other methods, such as personal networking, referrals, and job boards . How to ensure success when implementing an ATS As it should now be clear, there are enormous benefits to using applicant tracking systems , as long as you set yourself up for success. Recognize why you need an ATS What is the exact problem you need to solve? Success will come when the applicant tracking system compliments your current recruitment strategy. Trying to fix what isn't broken will only lead to frustration. Get buy-in from all stakeholders An applicant tracking system can only be as successful as the people using it. This means that you'll need to get buy-in from everyone who will be using the system. This includes managers, recruiters, and even the IT team. Have a plan for data migration An applicant tracking system will only be as good as the data you put into it. This means you'll need to have a plan for migrating your data into the system. This can be a time-consuming process, but it's essential for success. Summary Incorporating an applicant tracking system can be the difference between a successful hiring process and a frustrating one. They can save you time and money while also improving the quality of your hires.

As of the end of 2022, there were over 10 million job openings and only 6 million unemployed workers in the US. Needless to say, that makes for some steep competition when it comes to attracting new talent and keeping the workers you have. Higher wages are always a great strategy, but don't overlook the potential of employee benefits for not only keeping workers but attracting the best to your company. Here's what you need to know about the tremendous variety of employee benefits at your disposal, whether you employ your workers hourly or on salary, and how to implement them most effectively to build a great workforce and keep it for the long term. Employee Benefit Examples There are all kinds of different types of benefits for employees. Some are typical of most businesses, like health insurance or retirement plans, while others are a bit more unusual, like the ability to bring your pet to work or a game room at the office. Here are some of the most popular examples of employee benefits: Health insurance Paid time off Retirement plans Life insurance Disability insurance Family leave Flexible work schedules Work from home Training or funding for education Free meals, snacks, drinks, etc. Company equipment, such as vehicles or laptops Bonuses Why Bother With Employee Benefits Packages? You already offer a competitive salary, a safe and pleasant work environment, and you’re doing a good job of meeting your employees’ needs. So why do you need to offer employee benefits packages? The answer is simple: if you want to compete for good talent and keep it, you need to offer benefits. Here are some statistics that drive in the importance of employee benefits packages: 92% of employees said that benefits matter for overall job satisfaction. 29% of employees were looking for a job in the next year because they weren't satisfied with their benefits. 32% of employees who were not intending to look for another job said it was because they were happy with their benefits package. Clearly, a great benefits package is key not only to human resources success, but to the future of your business. If you can't attract and keep employees as well as your competition, your business is not going to survive. What are the 4 Major Types of Employee Benefits Packages? The four major types of employee benefits are time off, retirement plans, insurance, and additional pay. Nearly all businesses provide these benefits to some degree. Some are required by law, depending on the size of the business. Here's some more in-depth information about what these employee benefits might look like in a company: Insurance Insurance is perhaps the most essential aspect of employee benefits in America. In fact, until recently, when insurance companies were restricted in the degree to which they could reject coverage for pre-existing conditions, many employees stayed with their employer for the insurance, rather than the paycheck. Insurance is still a major driver for how people choose an employer and whether they stay with them. Depending on your state and the size of your company, there may be different regulations on exactly how much insurance you're required to provide to your employees. However, whatever is required by law, more competitive insurance plans are a powerful way benefit. Here are some of the insurance types you can offer: Health Vision Dental Disability (long and short term) Life Retirement Good retirement plans that keep building the longer the employee is with the company are a great way to inspire long-term loyalty as part of your employee benefits packages. A 401k which both the employee and company contribute to is a powerful incentive for employees to stay with the company, and can even prompt employees to stay a bit longer, delaying retirement as they wait for the stock market to be at an ideal place to cash out. Of course, there are all kinds of other retirement plans that can be funded by the company and don’t involve stock options. If long-term employee retention is a major goal of yours, good retirement plans are a great idea. Time Off Paid time off, whether for vacation, family leave, or something else, is extremely precious to pretty much every employee. After all, what could be more valuable than time for employees to spend however they like? Many companies distinguish between sick leave and vacation time, encouraging employees to plan vacations. Time off for the employee can be beneficial for the company as well. Employees who are able to relax and decompress with paid time off are likely to be happier, better workers. Hesitant about paying your employee for a lot of time when they're not working for you? A great alternative is to offer training days or team bonding opportunities. The employee feels like they get a break and a perk, but they are learning valuable information to improve their performance or forming bonds that will make them better team-mates, which feels like a good investment for the company as well. Money Let's face it, nothing beats cold hard cash when it comes to motivating employees to come and stay with your company. It may not be feasible to offer higher salaries, but extra compensation can be provided on a case-by-case basis as part of employee benefits packages. In fact, many business owners find it much better to leave room in the budget for these kinds of bonuses than to increase wages across the board. Employees may be more motivated to work for periodic high lump sumps than for regular wage increases. There are all kinds of ways to use extra compensation to motivate your employees and provide a valuable benefit. Here are just a few examples of how you can use extra money as a benefit: Commissions on sales jobs Performance awards Gifts for special occasions or holidays Rewards for competitions A helping hand when an employee has a personal setback What are the 5 types of employee benefits? The four primary types of benefits included in employee benefits packages are extra money, time off, retirement plans, and insurance. However, it can be argued that there is a fifth kind of employee benefit just as important as these four. This extra benefit is employee population-specific benefits. The perfect benefit to keep and attract your ideal worker may be specific to your situation. Here are a few examples. Do you have lots of young, relatively uneducated employees? Consider compensation for college or other educational programs and allow a flexible schedule that makes going to school while working feasible. Have an office that doesn't serve the public directly? Consider letting employees bring their pets to work, raising morale and team-building in the workplace while providing a practical solution for pet care Do you have lots of working hours outside of regular business hours when parents may struggle to find child care? Offer a daycare to alleviate that burden. Are you running a restaurant with employees who struggle to get a bite to eat themselves? Plan dinners in the kitchen free of charge so your employees always have a meal. Once you start thinking about it, you'll likely realize there are some types of benefits for employees particular to your company and work population that are particularly effective for your employee benefits packages. By honing in on these benefits, you can get a lot of return on your investment. Employees may be willing to work longer hours or settle for lower salaries if they feel that your company is helping care for their pets or kids. Workers who are provided compensation for education or training may decide to grow within your company so you can keep the best talent and build a workforce with long-term experience at your company. Sometimes, finding the perfect employee benefit for your particular company is more valuable than a significant raise. Top 10 Employee Benefits You May Not Have Thought Of You have surely thought about health insurance, retirement plans, and even free snacks when building employee benefits packages. However, if you're trying to beef up your employees benefit packages without going far beyond your budget, getting creative with some employee benefits you may not have thought about before can be helpful. Here are few examples of employee benefits that may not have occurred to you: 1. Pet Support People love their pets, arguably now more than ever before. In 2021, people spent around $300 more on their pets than they did in 2013, and that's likely a low estimate. A lot of that money goes into medical care and care for pets while employees are at work. Taking care of those concerns for your employees can be a tremendous benefit for pet owners. You can offer a pet insurance plan, let people bring their pets to work, or allow for flexible scheduling so that employees can go home during the day to care for pets. 2. Profit Sharing Want to invest in your employees and encourage them to invest in the company, but don't have a lot of liquid capital? Profit sharing can be a superb solution. Allow your employees to take some of the share of the profit for their hard work. They'll be more likely to stay around for the long-term, especially if they think your company is doing well, and they'll probably work harder too. 3. Training You have a built-in benefit right in your company, assuming that your workers have different skill sets. Training within your company as part of employee benefits packages allows your workers to see a path forward within your company, rather than seeking their fortunes elsewhere. For instance, a restaurant could create a shadowing program in which waiters can learn from chefs if they like. You won't have to spend much for the benefit, but you'll likely have much more dedicated waiters who are also a lot more knowledgeable about your menu. 4. Volunteering Opportunities Think it will be a hard sell to convince your employees to do more work at your request for free? You may be surprised by the enthusiasm your employee show for volunteering. Volunteering together can be a great team bonding opportunity. By facilitating volunteering opportunities, you can introduce your employees to a new experience they may enjoy. Needless to say, the fact that you won’t need to provide compensation is an added benefit for you. 5. Mental Health Breaks You already have vacation and sick days, so do you really need to give your employees another designated type of day they can use to take off work with? Many employers would argue that you do. Mental health is a serious problem for many workers. Offering a no-questions-asked opportunities for workers to take off when they need to can be deeply beneficial. Many companies benefit just from having a private break room where employees can take a moment to themselves during the work day if they need to. 6. Have a Library A library is a great way to foster bonding between your employees as a creative part of your employee benefits packages. You don't just need to stock it with books either. Encourage employees to bring in games, movies, and magazines, as well as books, to share with the rest of the company. Limited on space? Create a digital dropbox where employees can deposit suggestions of favorite TV shows, music they're listening to, etc. It’s not hard to create a sharing space where employees can get to know each other better. 7. Promote Good Money Management Many workers, especially young workers, struggle to manage their money. Over half of Americans don't have enough in their savings account to cover a $1,000 emergency. As the provider of your employees' income, you’re in a great position to encourage money management. Offer a saving account, provide classes or counseling in money management, and consider offering low-interest loans when your employees really need them. 8. Get Creative With Childcare You've probably already thought about offering good family leave, but if you have decided you can't afford any more family leave or stipends to help families with child care, think about some other options you may have. A designated area for breast pumping and storing breast milk and a flexible schedule so that mothers can breastfeed more easily can be a huge perk. Even if you can't subsidize child care all year, consider offering financial help with a summer school program or camp so that your employees don't take on an additional financial burden between school years. By thinking outside the box, you can find some great ways to help your employees with childcare. Asking your employees with children where they’re struggling most is a great way to start. 9. Unlimited Vacation If more vacation time is a good perk, what about unlimited vacation time? Unlimited vacation time can be a frightening perspective for a company. After all, how will you know if you have sufficient staffing if everybody can take off for as long as they want? In fact, many employers find that offering unlimited vacation works out well as an affordable feature of attractive employee benefits packages. After all, it doesn’t cost you anything to allow employees to take unpaid time off when they want to. You can still be demanding about ensuring that employees schedule their time off ahead so you'll know you have coverage. Giving employees the option to make less and work less when they want to can help you keep employees you may otherwise have lost. It’s also an affordable perk that attracts great talent. Workers who want time for their own projects or private life and don’t need as much income may decide to pick up some hours and extra income with you, offering you a more flexible and often more capable workforce. 10. Office Visitors One way to make your company a more enjoyable place to work is to arrange for visitors to the office that will make your employees’ work day better. Consider having a therapy dog or even someone's pet come to visit for the day. Hire a chiropractor or massage therapist to provide their services to your employees for free. Even something as silly as hiring a Santa Clause for a holiday party at work can inspire good feelings for your company from your employees. Your employees will find work a lot more fun if they’re always wondering what wonderful new thing you're going to come up with. What's Included in a Full Benefits Package? Every company varies a little bit in what kind of employee benefits packages they offer. However, there is a definite expectation when a company offers full benefits. Here are the benefits that you might expect from a full benefits package: Health. A full benefits package definitely offers a health plan, but the plan is less likely to offer only the bare minimum in healthcare and more likely to provide a complete plan that covers alternative therapies like acupuncture. Vision and dental. Many companies offer some form of health insurance, but vision and dental are typically only part of a full benefits package. Short and long-term disability insurance. Disability insurance puts employees’ minds at ease, especially if they’re in a line of work that requires significant physical effort. Retirement plan. Many full-benefit packages feature a 401K retirement plan that allows employers and employees to contribute. Having help saving for retirement is a powerful motivator for long-term loyalty from employees. Paid time off. Sick leave is a given for most companies, but paid vacation time can be harder to come by. Paying for time off, especially significant amounts of it, dramatically improves employees' quality of life. Build Employee Benefits Packages that Attract and Keep the Best Talent No matter what kind of business you have or how many workers you employ, benefits are something you need to be thinking about. Your company may be small enough that you aren't required to offer health insurance, but if other businesses like yours are doing so, you're unlikely to keep the best employees for long. Building a company with employees that your competition rejects is not likely to result in smooth business operations. In fact, the job market is so competitive that you may not be able to attract enough employees to keep your doors open unless you offer a good benefits package. By getting creative about the kinds of benefits you can offer, you can attract good workers and keep them happy even on a tight budget.

Your employees are the single most impactful resource at your company’s disposal, but they’re also one of the most difficult resources to manage. Employee turnover is a serious threat to any organization. According to research, 40% of workers are currently considering quitting their jobs within the next year. But the cost of employee turnover is much more than just monetary. It can also hinder your productivity, lower morale, and hurt your brand reputation. Here’s what you need to know about employee turnover costs. What is employee turnover? Employee turnover is the total number of workers who leave a business over a set period of time. This turnover rate includes all employees who leave, whether voluntarily or involuntarily (through layoffs, firings, etc.). To calculate your business’s turnover rate, simply divide the numbers of employees who left your company by the total number of employees at the beginning of the set time period. For example, if you had 100 employees at the beginning of the month and 7 leave, your employee turnover rate would be 0.07 or 7% for the month. Naturally, the lower the number, the better. What is the average employee turnover cost? According to Gallup surveys, the average cost of an individual employee turnover is between one-half to two times an employee’s annual salary for each employee you lose. For many businesses, employee turnover costs can easily reach into the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year — if not more! If you consider the average employee salary is around $50,000, that means it’ll cost your business anywhere from $25,000 to $100,000 every time an employee leaves! If even only five employees quit in a given year, it can cost your company six figures, and that’s being conservative. The real cost of employee turnover The cost of turnover can be a serious drain on your company’s bottom line. But unfortunately, the monetary expense isn’t the only cost your business will have to pay. It might sound ridiculous that a simple turnover can cost you over six figures, but there are dozens of expenses that go into replacing employees, many of which can’t be measured in cash value. These are just a few of the expenses that go into the total cost of turnover for your company: Recruitment costs – The cost of finding and recruiting a new employee. This includes the advertising, job board subscriptions, screening, interviewing, and hiring processes. Onboarding costs – The employee onboarding process typically takes a few days or even weeks to get a new hire up to speed with your company. All that time processing paperwork and training costs your company money. Training cost – Training isn’t complete after the onboarding. New hires typically get on-the-job training during the early period of their employment. When your other employees take time to answer questions and train new hires, it costs your business in labor hours. Lost productivity – It takes time for new employees to get up to speed with your business processes and their role. They’re usually less productive than experienced team members, which hurts your business’s overall productivity, not to mention the time other employees spend teaching new hires and away from their regular duties. Lost engagement – It’s disheartening to see your team members come and go so quickly. High turnover rates can reduce team morale and hurt your existing team’s engagement with their jobs and the company as a whole. Customer service – New employees take longer to perform their jobs and aren’t as quick at overcoming problems or understanding company processes. This can cause customers to become frustrated with their experience working with your company if they’re always talking to new employees. Missed deadlines – The loss of productivity from new hires can cause your company to miss important deadlines, causing your company to lose money and perhaps even clients. Lost institutional knowledge – Swapping out a long–time, experienced employee for a new hire means your company loses some of its skill and knowledge. The longer employees stick around, the better they understand your industry. Cultural impact – When your employees see people leaving regularly, they start to wonder why and may begin to question why they still work there, hurting the workplace culture as a whole. Brand damage – Poor customer service and missed deadlines will hurt your brand reputation with customers. Perhaps even worse, a negative brand reputation will also make it more difficult to find new employees to fill vacancies. Nobody will want to work for your company! More turnover – By negatively impacting the culture and adding frustrations for your current employees, a high turnover rate can actually lead to more turnover, costing your business even more in the long run. Now that you know everything affected by employee turnover, it’s easy to see how a single employee leaving can cost up to two times their annual salary! How to calculate the cost of turnover The multitude of elements that go into replacing an employee is what makes it so difficult to accurately calculate employee turnover costs. Many businesses don’t have systems in place to track expenses like total onboarding and training costs, loss of productivity, customer dissatisfaction, or exact labor costs in departments like HR, operations, and finance — but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to get close. If you want to calculate employee turnover costs, you’ll first need to collect some extensive data: Daily rate of departed employee’s salary Number of days the position will remain open Daily rate of the manager in charge of recruiting and screening new hires Advertising costs for the job posting Hours spent screening resumes Hours spent in interviews, both over the phone/internet and in person Cost of background checks Daily rate for hiring manager and trainer(s) Total days spent training the new employee Number of working days in the new hire’s first three months (your standard onboarding time) Once you have the data, put it all together and calculate the cost of turnover per employee. You’ll need to calculate the cost of covering the vacant position, which is typically the departed employee’s daily rate multiplied by the number of days the position remains open. Then add it to the hourly rate of all the hiring managers, recruiters, HR team members, and trainers involved in the hiring process, multiplied by the number of hours they worked on the project. This will give you the cost of departure for a single employee. Now, you can take the individual turnover cost and use it to determine the total employee turnover costs for a set period of time. First, calculate your turnover rate by dividing the total number of employees who left by the total number of employees for the given period. Then, multiply your total team size, turnover rate, and the cost of departure per employee. For example, if you have a team of 100 people, a turnover rate of 7% annually, and a cost of departure of $20,000, your total annual turnover costs would look like this: 100 x $20,000 x 0.07 = $140,000 per year That should give you a rough estimate of the total cost for the turnover of one employee. Of course, that still doesn’t take into account the loss in productivity, customer service, and employee morale — which are difficult to put into a dollar amount, anyway. No matter how you spin it, employee turnover is a cost that no business can afford. Factors that cause employee turnover Naturally, with the exorbitant cost of employee turnover, it makes sense that you’d want to know how to avoid workers leaving for greener pastures. And surprisingly, it’s not always about pay. According to HR experts, these are some of the main causes of employee turnover: Company culture Nobody likes to work in a toxic work culture. It doesn’t take long for 40 hours per week in a negative culture to wear on you and cause you to look for something better. If employees don’t enjoy spending time at work, they’re not going to be as loyal to your company, their responsibilities, or the team as a whole. According to polls, a toxic workplace is 10.4 times more likely to cause an employee to leave than anything pay-related. Your employees spend a lot of time at work. Do your best to make sure they enjoy it — or at least don’t hate it. Leadership Workers interact with their supervisors and managers every day. It makes a big difference whether a company’s leadership is polite and understanding with their employees or if they constantly bark orders. Bad leadership is a sure-fire way to encourage workers to leave a company. According to Gallup, 52% of employees who voluntarily leave a company do so because of a manager. Whether it’s a bad manager, or just a simple lack of effort, encouraging your leadership to work with employees and take the time to build positive relationships can help you avoid the expensive cost of employee turnover. Lack of opportunity People always want to know they’re working toward something. Whether it’s that next big promotion or just picking up a few skills, available opportunities in the workplace is a major driver for employee retention. In fact, 63% of employees who voluntarily quit their jobs in 2021 cited lack of opportunities for advancement as one of the reasons for quitting. Many business owners and managers have trouble maintaining opportunities for advancements for all their employees. After all, there are only so many needed positions! However, remember that upward mobility isn’t the only type of mobility. Continuing education and employee development opportunities are great ways to help your employees feel like they’re advancing in their careers without actually needing a fancy new title or corner office. Communication There’s nothing more frustrating than feeling like you’re stuck in a one-way conversation. Unfortunately, this is the reality for many employees around the world. They provide feedback to their managers about how to improve the business or operations, and all their amazing recommendations fall on deaf ears. This recurring frustration has a direct impact on employee turnover rates. According to studies, businesses with effective communication channels are 50% more likely to have low employee turnover rates. With just a little bit of back-and-forth, you can avoid the high cost of employee turnover. Lack of employee recognition Not that you need to start handing out gold stars, but it’s always nice to feel appreciated for the work you do. Your employees work hard, and they want to feel recognized for it. If they don’t, they’re more likely to start looking for other opportunities for employment. Around two-thirds of employees say they would quit their jobs if they don’t feel appreciated. This number jumps to 76% for younger generations like millennials and gen Zers. Recognizing your employees’ good work makes them feel more connected to the business, encouraging them to stick around for the long term. Lack of flexibility Ten years ago, work flexibility wasn’t something that was even on hiring managers’ radars. But ever since the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a boom in remote work, the flexibility to work when you want, where you want has been of the utmost importance for employees. In fact, 45% of people who quit their jobs in 2021 cited the lack of flexibility as a reason they left. The days of the rigid 9-5 workday are quickly disappearing. Modern employees want the ability to create their own work/life balances, and employers who don’t allow that kind of flexibility will pay the cost in high turnover rates. Don’t let employee turnover costs hinder your business The cost of employee turnover isn’t something your business can afford. It’s much more than just the monetary value lost searching for and training new hires. It can also hurt your overall productivity, team morale, brand reputation, and much, much more. The best way to reduce employee turnover costs is to pay attention to your team’s needs and desires. They’re not just a means to an end; they’re people and want to be treated as such. Consider your onboarding processes, ensure effective communication with your team, provide ample opportunities for advancement, and allow enough flexibility for your team to create the balance they need. In the end, the cost of creating a positive workplace for your employees immensely outweighs the cost of recurring employee turnover.

Staff turnover is a constant reality for businesses as people leave and new people join. But just because turnover is an inevitability, it doesn’t mean you should do nothing about it. Tracking staff turnover is key for both long and short term planning. So, this brings up the question: how is employee turnover calculated? Here’s what you need to know. How is employee turnover calculated? To calculate employee turnover, we need to use the employee turnover rate. This is a formula that calculates how many employees have left a company within a certain amount of time. The formula is as follows: Employee turnover rate = (Employees who left/ Average number of employees) x100 So, in order to use this formula, we need access to the different variables. The first is the simplest, employees who left is relatively self explanatory and so you just need to have access to the number of employees who have left the company (both voluntarily and involuntarily). The second variable is the Average number of employees. To get this number, you need to add your beginning and ending workforce and divide by two (Avg = [B+E]/2). Finally, multiplying by 100 will give you the employee turnover rate expressed as a percentage. What is a good employee turnover rate? Calculating employee turnover rate is one thing but what exactly do you do with this arbitrary number? Well, the first port of call is comparing this number with relevant benchmarks. You can compare your rate with the industry average, sectors like hospitality typically have a very high turnover rate, while sectors like government have much lower rates. You can also look at internal benchmarks and compare your turnover rate to years prior to see if any trends are emerging. Why does employee turnover matter? Employee turnover certainly matters. A high turnover rate suggests serious issues with either the culture, policies or onboarding or a business, potentially all three. Employees can leave for any reason and you should begrudge a business because of someone retiring or moving away. But, generally speaking, employees will only leave if they are unhappy and so a high turnover may mean lots of unhappy staff. Analyze your turnover rate If your turnover rate is cause for alarm, the next thing you need to do is analyze why your turnover rate is an issue. Who is leaving? Figuring out exactly who is leaving can help address a high turnover rate. If it’s largely starters who are leaving then perhaps you need to question your onboarding and training systems to see why they are struggling to stick their landing at your business. On the other hand, if it’s typically senior employees that are leaving then perhaps there are issues to do with glass ceilings, decision making processes or even pay. Is a certain demographic leaving? This can be extremely worrying as it may mean that there are serious flaws in your business culture. Perhaps a certain group is being made to feel unsafe or unappreciated. Not only does this make hiring from that group in the future difficult, but it may even open you up to potential legal issues with discrimination. Different groups will almost certainly require a different response from management so it’s important to understand the characteristics of those leaving. Why are they leaving? It may seem obvious but it’s important to find out why these employees want to leave. Setting up exit interviews or surveys can help illuminate potential threats from both within and outside your company. Where are they going? Are people leaving to join one of your competitors? This may be cause for alarm because it may mean your competition is providing a better offering for talent whether that’s pay, benefits or culture. Are people leaving the industry entirely? You may think that leaving the industry entirely means your business is not at fault but that may not be true. Perhaps workloads are taking a toll on your staff and leaving them burnt out. Or maybe they have been made to feel that a career in your industry is too insecure. When are they leaving? Finally, you need to analyze how long people leavers have been with the business. If all the people are leaving within their first year, then it may mean that there are serious issues with your recruitment and onboarding process. Perhaps you're setting the wrong expectations with your job listings or aren’t providing sufficient training for the workload. What is a good turnover rate for employees? Here are the average employee turnover rates for different industries: Construction: 56.9% Manufacturing: 39.9% Trade, Transportation, and Utilities: 54.5% Information: 38.9% Financial activities: 28.5% Professional and Business services: 64.2% Education and Health services: 37.3% Leisure and Hospitality: 84.9% Government: 18% These averages can provide a useful benchmark to help you understand how good your business’s turnover rate is. Summary Hopefully you now know how employee turnover is calculated. The employee turnover calculation can help you understand how high your turnover rates are compared to your industry or even your own past rates. If your turnover rate is too high, it’s important to get to the bottom of it and solve the issue before it can cause further damage.

Over time it's normal for employees to leave, following new opportunities while new employees come in to take their place. But when businesses begin to see employees leave at a higher rate than usual, then it can become a problem. High employee turnover can lead to multiple negative outcomes for businesses, such as increased costs, disruption of operations and the morale of those still employed at the organization. So, what are the real causes of high employee turnover? Here’s what you need to know. What is High Turnover? High employee turnover refers to when more employees leave an organization than it brings on board over a certain period of time. Companies tend to see a normal average rate of turnover as part of natural staff changes due to external circumstances. A high turnover rate is usually seen when one or more of the contributing factors are higher than normal, resulting in a significantly higher rate of employee departures that is above the industry and sector average. Why Employee Turnover is a Problem? When an organization experiences higher than average staff turnover rates then there can be serious consequences for the business as a whole. In the most extreme cases, these can include becoming unable to operate efficiently, damaging customer relations and even financial losses. The main problem with high employee turnover lies in its cost. The cost of recruitment, training and onboarding can be significant. Furthermore, the time lost due to not having a full staff can be even more costly. This is especially true for mission critical roles that business operations may depend on, such as in high production environments. The situation only becomes worse when highly skilled employees or those with years of experience leave the organization in search of better opportunities elsewhere. It then requires considerable effort from the remaining workforce to train new employees and help them reach their maximum performance level and contribute towards the success of an organization. What is a High Turnover Rate? A high employee turnover rate is typically considered to be any rate that exceeds the industry average. This can vary depending on the sector and size of the business, so it's important to establish a benchmark for comparison purposes. An acceptable employee turnover rate would generally range from 10-20% per year, with anything higher than this usually being considered as high. But again, it's important to recognise that different industries have different expectations for turnover. For example, the retail industry is typically known for higher employee turnover than more stable sectors such as engineering or medical services. What Are The Causes of High Employee Turnover? The primary causes of high employee turnover can be broadly categorized into two main categories: external and internal factors. External factors are those outside the control of an organization, such as the salary offered by competitors or changes in the economy. Meanwhile, internal factors are those that an organization can control through corporate policies, practices and procedures. Taking these two categories into consideration, let us look at the most common causes of high employee turnover: 1. Compensation The compensation package will always be the top, or near top priority for most employees. People need to be able to sustain their lives, pay their rent/mortgage and ensure their families can have decent medical care. If these basic necessities of life can't be met, then you can expect your employees to look elsewhere. 2. Poor Working Environment Your employees are expected to spend a third of their entire day in the office and so this is a place that needs to be comfortable and rewarding in order for them to stay. If the working environment is poor, with cramped cubicles, inadequate facilities and a lack of resources, then this can be a real turnoff. 3. Limited Career Path Many employees leave organizations because of their feeling that there is no opportunity for career development and progression. When there's no convincing career path available or attractive prospects, workers may look elsewhere for better opportunities. 4. Poor Management The job of a manager is certainly not an easy one. They are expected to juggle multiple responsibilities, while also motivating and leading their team. And while it can be difficult to get the most out of your employees, if they feel that they are not being appreciated, their performance and engagement can suffer and soon they will be out the door. It's important that managers avoid issues like favoritism, micromanagement and unrealistic expectations, as these are all factors that can lead to a high turnover rate. 5. Unhealthy Organizational Culture A company's culture is an important part of how it functions and how its employees feel about working there. A positive organizational culture can inspire employees and lead to massive employee engagement. But on the other hand, a toxic work environment can be a major reason why employees quit their jobs. Organizations must strive to create an open and healthy culture where employees feel valued, respected and secure. If they don't, then it's likely that they will soon find themselves with an employee turnover problem. 6. Lack of Flexibility In today’s fast-paced world, many people are looking for employers that value their personal life as much as their professional one. When companies fail to provide adequate flexibility or fail to support their employees’ personal needs, the result often leads to them leaving for organizations who will. Particularly now, in a post-Covid world, having the option to work from home has become a norm that many employees will expect. 7. Lack Of Training And Development Opportunities One of the most common reasons reported by existing employees is a lack of training and development opportunities offered by current employers. Employees need to be challenged and they need to have chances at expanding their skillset. When such prospects are limited, people often look for it elsewhere. 8. Boredom You can't expect a person to do the same thing over and over again forever without feeling bored or uninspired. If an employee is constantly doing the same task and there's no room for creativity, they are likely to start looking elsewhere for opportunities that will challenge them. 9. Poor Recruitment Process Sometimes, in order to understand why an employee leaves, you need to look back far before they were hired. If your hiring process is flawed then it's possible you are bringing in candidates who are a poor fit for your business and will inevitably leave before long. Poor recruitment can cause a lot of damage, so it's important to build an effective process that helps you identify the right candidates and an interview process that ensures the right fit. 10. Poor Systems Finally, if your systems are outdated, cumbersome or unreliable then it can create a lot of stress for your employees. If they have to spend too much time dealing with technology issues or navigating complex processes, then there's no doubt they will be looking at alternatives. How to Reduce Employee turnover? The most effective way of reducing high employee turnover rates is to address the underlying causes discussed above. Here are five steps organizations can take to reduce their staff turnover: 1. Invest in Employee Training and Development If you want your employees to invest their career in your company, then you need to simultaneously invest in their career. Create clear development plans and training regimes that show your staff that you're invested in their growth. 2. Create Attractive Professional Paths A career path that offers attractive prospects should be available if an organization wants to keep its best talent. By developing clear career paths that reflect specific roles within an organization, it can provide vertical progression towards greater responsibilities and rewards as well as giving employees something tangible to work towards. 3. Offer Competitive Salary & Benefits Packages This is an area that employers simply need to bite the bullet on. It doesn't matter how many related benefits you offer, if your compensation package isn't competitive to the industry, you simply are not going to be able to hold on to great talent. 4. Promote a Healthy Organizational Culture A business culture is not something that can change overnight, but is still worth addressing. This involves championing your staff and ensuring they feel recognised and respected for their work, making people feel equally valued and allowing open dialogue and communication to be the norm. Once you have a culture that enshrines these factors, your employees will be more likely to not only stay but thrive. 5. Focus on Employee Engagement Employee engagement is a critical part of any successful business. It refers to the emotional and psychological investment an individual has in their work and the organization they work for. It encompasses employees' motivation, commitment, and satisfaction with their work and workplace. By focusing on employee engagement you can completely change the nature of the relationship between an employee and their job. They begin to view their work as their own, take pride in what they do and feel invested in the success of the business. 6.Create a Great Work Environment Work should be a place where your staff feel comfortable and inspired to be the best they can be. This means that their work environment is safe, free of toxicity, and designed to foster creativity, collaboration and productivity. Each level of their workspace needs to be right from the actual workspace, to break out areas and even the systems that they use. 7.Offer Flexibility Finally,  it's important to acknowledge that today's workforce is looking for flexibility and options. With the rise of remote working, freelancing and flexible hours, employers aren't just offering flexibility as a bonus or reward, but rather as a key part of the employment relationship to show respect and care for the employee's time and needs. Is It Ever Good To Have High Employee Turnover? High employee turnover is usually seen as an undesirable outcome that should be prevented if possible; however, there are cases where elevated levels of turnover may be considered more normal. For example, in many retail businesses, staff are entry level or perhaps even part-time and are not expected to make a long term commitment to the company so turnover is to be expected. However, it is important to note that this should not be the desired outcome. Instead, organizations should strive to reduce their staff turnover rates in order to maintain a healthy and productive workforce and ensure its long-term stability. Summary High job turnover amongst your staff can be hugely damaging to any company. Inability to keep your staff means you are in a constant state of having to invest in hiring and onboarding while also not being able to take advantage of the compounding value of longer term workers. By addressing the many factors that may contribute to high turnover, you can help protect your business and ensure you have a great, consistent team to help you grow.

There’s no other way about it—SHRM (Society for Human Resource Management) reports that it costs approximately $4,700 to source, hire, and train a new candidate to the point that they are ready to work independently. If you’ve got even a little bit of turnover, you’re going to feel it in the hiring budget as much as you feel it in the workforce. After all, if you can’t figure out how to keep employees from leaving, you’re going to keep feeling it. Not only that, but you’ll keep spending a small fortune on new hires that probably aren’t going to do much better because you’re not getting to the root of the problem. The first step in reducing employee turnover is to know why it’s happening. If you can’t pinpoint the cause, you won’t be able to come up with effective solutions. In this guide, we’ll take a look at everything you need to know about how to reduce employee turnover, including what “reduced turnover” means, why it matters, and what you can do to boost retention and reduce the number of people leaving your organization for all reasons. What Does Reduced Turnover Mean? Reduced turnover means that you have fewer employees leaving the organization than you did before. Typically, it’s referring to the people being lost due to poor hiring practices or a lack of appropriate training, but the term “turnover” refers to the number of people who leave the organization within a specific time frame, such as each month or even each year. If you reduce turnover, you reduce the number of people leaving your business for other opportunities or any number of other reasons. Several benefits come from reducing employee turnover, but the time and money involved are high on the list for most companies. Why Is Employee Turnover Important? Employee turnover is important because it tells you how many employees are leaving your company compared to how many are staying. It also tells you how quickly people leave the company, and how much it’s costing you to have these people coming and going all the time. Employee turnover can impact several aspects of the business. When you know who is coming and going, as well as how frequently those comings and goings are happening, it will be easier for you to improve retention and reduce turnover. Although turnover can be a learning opportunity for your business, consistent churn means that something bigger is going on and you need to address the issues at hand. Before we get into the details of how you can do that, let’s look at some of the benefits of reducing turnover. Why Is It Important to Reduce Employee Turnover? Companies want to reduce turnover, or stop people from leaving, to save money and streamline their business efforts. Fewer people coming and going will also mean more consistency and efficiency in all areas of the business. Because turnover can affect all the different areas listed above, it’s best to corral it and get a handle on the situation before it gets out of control. The last thing you want is to be that company known for being a revolving door of employees—those companies are out there and you cannot be one of them. To avoid that, you need to figure out how to stop high employee turnover and improve employee retention. Turnover costs upwards of $1 trillion to the U.S. economy each year. That can hit even the strongest businesses hard, which is why the goal is always to reduce employee turnover and boost retention. Some of the benefits of reduced turnover include: ·      Lower operational costs ·      Improved morale ·      Increased productivity ·      Better customer experience ·      Better employee experience ·      Increased efficiency in training and onboarding ·      Improved culture ·      Improved access to top talent It’s about delivering a consistent experience for the customer every single time. The more employees you have that have been around for a long time, the easier that will be. Training and onboarding take a lot of time and effort and too many “newbies” can make even your most streamlined processes a scattered mess if you’re not careful. Fortunately, for as many reasons as people leave jobs, there are equally as many strategies to help ensure that your people aren’t the ones who are leaving. How to Reduce Employee Turnover: Effective Strategies to Add to Your List As with any part of business, there are as many ways to reduce employee turnover as there are causes of it in the first place. What works for your organization may not be the same as what works for another. Having the right hiring process in the first place will ensure that your organization is attracting the right people, but there’s so much more that you can do. For those trying to figure out how to keep employees from leaving, the list of strategies below is a good starting point. Think about how you can improve the hiring and onboarding process so that you’re getting the right talent in the first place. Then, consider how you can keep employees engaged and satisfied in their roles over time so that they are less likely to leave. Somewhere between competitive pay and benefits, employee recognition, and more flexibility, you’ll find plenty of people willing to stick around for the right reasons. Perfect the Hiring Process If you hire the right people, they’ll be less likely to leave. If you are struggling with turnover or just trying to make sure that it doesn’t become an issue, make sure that you go through your hiring process and make sure that everything is taken care of. Check the job listing and description for accuracy and make sure that you use keywords and phrases that will attract the right candidates. Don’t hire bodies just to fill positions. Your company should have a screening and hiring process in place that ensures that you have the right people for the job, first and foremost. That way, you’re not going to lose people because they’re “not a good fit” or “not cut out for the position,” etc. Equally important is to have a solid onboarding process that covers all the necessary areas of training and business information. It may take time to perfect, but your training and onboarding efforts should be focused on setting your people up for success both now and in the future. Provide Employee Recognition Employees who feel valued will stay with an organization longer than those who don’t. Recognizing your employees for their accomplishments and achievements will improve morale and company culture. It also supports your initiatives regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion, which are a big part of business today. This will also help build a community within the workplace and bring people together over shared accomplishments and celebrating various life events. Social recognition is an investment that every business needs to make. It can increase engagement and productivity, boost the quality of work, and reduce turnover and absenteeism. Companies that offer social recognition programs will see increased job satisfaction, improved motivation, and improved employee retention. Offer Competitive Salaries and Benefits Packages Today, employees are demanding better pay and benefits from all employers. These are two main elements that help people choose jobs and decide to change those jobs. Higher pay and better benefits are at the top of the list of what would keep people loyal to an employer. Make sure that you know what you should be paying different employees and that your compensation structure is competitive. Consider the benefits and other compensation offered besides pay, too. If you offer fully-paid health insurance, for example, you’re going to stand out against a competitor that is similar but makes people pitch in for their insurance premiums. Don’t go broke on this, but make sure that you’re keeping things competitive and more importantly, paying people what they’re worth. Monitor and Mitigate Toxic Employees Toxic employees find their way into every workplace at one time or another. Make sure that you’re keeping an eye out for anyone who could harm your team’s morale and productivity. Whether they’ve been around for years or they somehow got through the rigorous hiring process and suddenly you realize they’re not going to work out, you need to make sure that you’re aware of these people and how to handle them. Some can be coached or developed into better employees, but most of the time, it might be necessary to make the hard choice to let someone go. After all, no matter how “effective” someone might be at their job or how hard they work, they could be creating a cultural drain on your organization and they will ultimately do more harm than good. Get rid of the employees that are eventually going to become turnover now and you’ll enjoy fewer issues with toxic and negative employees in the future. Offer More Flexibility Everyone in the world has seen just how much we can do at home. The pandemic created a demand for the ultimate in flexible scheduling and working arrangements. Now, many companies arbitrarily return to the office and assume “normal operations” without even considering the perks of maintaining that flexibility and convenience for employees. Companies that want to reduce turnover in 2023 will continue to offer flexible scheduling options, whether that be hybrid remote schedules or the option of work hours, or any other flex option. They will focus on hiring people to get the job done, not just to clock the hours, and that will allow them to embrace all the aspects of scheduling and workplace flexibility that will improve retention. Monitor Employee Engagement How engaged are your employees? This is a large part of how likely people are to stay with an organization. Higher engagement means lower turnover and vice versa. While many companies have worked hard to improve engagement in regard to emotional and social elements, few focused on engaging with the actual position and the company in their job role. Several factors influence employee engagement, but relationships with management are a big part of it. Not all industries make it easy to inspire employees—there’s not much that’s inspirational about machining the same part for the same equipment time and again—that’s where you have to get creative. Use surveys and feedback to find out how you can leverage your employee engagement to help accomplish goals and improve turnover at the same time. Getting people engaged can make them feel more valued and thus, make them more likely to stick around. Build a Strong Corporate Culture Culture is a word that’s all over the working world right now—but it’s so much more than just a buzzword. Companies that have the best retention are those that have a strong culture that embraces employees, appreciates them, and promotes a culture of teamwork and productivity. Your corporate culture is going to make or break several areas of your business's success, including the employees that you keep. You can do everything else right, including hiring people who are qualified for their positions. But, if you don’t have a good culture that’s inviting and engaging, you’re not going to keep those qualified candidates for very long. Many people looking for work today are searching for culture first, so make sure that yours is on point. Provide Opportunities for Continuing Education and Development Employees hate changing jobs almost as much as employers hate having to hire for the same position time and time again. Not just that, but when people were surveyed, they said they would gladly forego as much as 12% of their salary expectation if they were given more development and training opportunities in their jobs. People are no longer satisfied with just going to work and coming home. They want to know that they’re contributing to something and that there’s more potential to their job than what they do now. They want you to suggest they go back to school, have them attend a professional training class, or even create learning and development opportunities for in-house transfers. Whatever it may be, make sure that you’re giving people as many opportunities as possible. Promote Work-Life Balance Employees today consider benefits and perks to be primary factors in choosing a job. One of those perks should be a strong work-life balance that allows people to live their lives and enjoy all the moments, utilizing flexible schedules, hybrid work models, and plenty of paid time off and vacation time. Some companies are switching to unlimited PTO models that are designed to promote a better balance, but you don’t have to go that route if you’re not ready for it. Just make sure that you choose efforts that do promote the type of work-life balance you want your employees to have. Also, practice what you preach, and don’t sit around the office until 7 PM when you’ve sent everyone else home at 4. People want their own work-life balance, but they also want to see it practiced at the higher levels within the organization, so they know it’s a top-down initiative. Prioritize Employee Happiness Some executives looking for metrics might think that “happiness” is a little too fluffy to consider important, but the numbers backing it up don’t lie. When employees are more engaged, they are more effective. They are happier and feel more valued, and therefore are more likely to continue to contribute to the team. They won’t need or want to seek work elsewhere because they are appreciated where they are at. You should make sure that you check in with employees regularly so that you can get an idea of where they stand and how they’re doing. This will also help you determine how you can go about creating a better environment for people in the future and which elements of your company’s culture may need a second glance before you set them in stone. Standardize Performance Reviews Standard processes will ensure that you have a way of getting accurate measurements. If you want to see how employees are doing, standardize the review process and make sure that everyone knows what is expected of them. That “annual performance review” model of decades past is no longer good enough. As many as 80% of employees that felt unmotivated or criticized after an ineffective review began searching for new work. When you make the performance review process a collaborative and ongoing effort that everyone can be engaged in, you are helping improve relationships and connect people to their teams in a better way. You can align individual and company goals and help get a better gauge of process and performance among your employees. When you connect goals to metrics and management, it’s easier to monitor and improve things. Be Transparent Transparency is an admirable attribute of any business. Those who want to reduce employee turnover will need to embrace it and all that it has to offer. Communicate with employees and create an ongoing feedback culture where everyone is on the same page about how things are going and how people are doing in their roles. Consider town halls, one-on-one meetings, and other opportunities to engage with your employees in a transparent way that makes them feel valued and understand their role. Being transparent will also afford you the chance to get more out of your employees. When people feel like they’re being informed and appreciated, they tend to give more than those who don’t. Employees who feel like they have a voice and an understanding of what’s going on will be more invested, which will lead to a reduction in turnover. Analyze Current Trends to Identify Issues and Solutions This could be one of the most valuable tips in this entire guide, which is why we saved it for last. Having the capability to collect and analyze data related to turnover is going to be a game changer. Real-time software tools will help you break down turnover by period, identify reasons for leaving, departmental issues, geographical factors, and so much more. These tools can help you gain valuable insights about your business and why people leave. When you know why turnover is high, it’s easier to reduce it. It’s also easier to find better strategies to onboard and retain employees because you already know what isn’t working. You can use all kinds of metrics and data to learn where the hiring process is failing, or if it’s an issue after the hiring has occurred and people are left to their own devices to work in their new roles. In any case, using this information can help you improve your talent management strategy and reduce turnover in several different ways. Reducing Turnover Starts with Turning Over a New Leaf For most businesses, embracing the new world of work is still a work in progress. However, it’s not something that you have to do completely on your own. Between the tips and tools that are available today, organizations have everything they need to improve workplace conditions to reduce turnover and create a better talent pool within the organization. The strategies listed here are just a handful of the ones that you can find out there, so feel free to see what other ways you can reduce employee turnover in your organization. Today, you may be interested in adding a cloud-based HR platform that will manage every step of the employee journey, from hiring to training and beyond. These platforms can integrate with the rest of your software, including CRMs and project management tools, and they can help you track performance and enable better retention by monitoring the ongoing efforts of the organization. No matter how you go about it, you need to figure out what’s going on so that you can reduce employee turnover by addressing the specific issues that are plaguing your organization. This can help improve retention, employee satisfaction, and so much more.

A high-energy culture is when leaders and managers approach their work and employees with a “can do” attitude. Leaders realize the power they have to influence those around them and the success of their restaurant by behaving in a manner that reflects their positive personal beliefs and values. In high-energy cultures, employees feel more strongly connected to the business’s purpose and goals—and that’s all a result of how leadership shows up day after day. Ways to Create a High-Energy Culture There are several steps you can take to create a workplace culture that generates energy. Set a high standard. Let your employees know what you expect of them. Do not settle for just going through the motions. Let them know that you want excellent customer service, food prepared at top-quality standard, and stations spotless to name a few examples. Then as leaders, be sure that you also perform at your best reflecting those same standards you set for your staff. Communicate effectively. For any relationship to flourish, there needs to be communication. Leaders need to let staff know of any changes, such as hours of operation, procedure changes, or new safety rules. Leaders also need to communicate their own enthusiasm for the work. Words of encouragement and excitement will get the staff pumped for the day and ready to do their best. Recognize good work. Don’t focus on the bad and only talk to your workers when they make a mistake. Try to focus on when an employee does a great job, like satisfying a difficult customer or managing a rush. Be sure to let that employee know you are pleased with their work. Also, shine lights on those successes so the rest of the team can see and emulate that same behavior. Trust your employees. Not only is micromanaging exhausting, but it can also make your employees feel like they’re not adding value. Extend trust. Believe that once you give your employees instructions that they’ll follow through. Showing them you respect them and see them as a capable member of the team goes a long way. It will also help them build trust and respect for you. Create a positive work environment. Try to eliminate as much stress as you can from the job. Though you can’t entirely remove all stressors from every job, you can simplify processes, uphold tidiness standards to free workstations of clutter, and implement safety protocols. Also, encourage laughter and friendly banter. Work is more fun with both. Foster community. Try to create a team-like organization. Unite your employees around shared business goals. Let them know how they can contribute to the company's success and let them know when benchmarks have been reached because of their hard work. Help them grow in their career path. Think of ways that your employees can be challenged on the job and learn new skills. Keep in mind that many of your employees view their job as a stepping stone in their career path, so be a leader that offers assistance instead of creating barriers. The Benefits of a High Energy Workplace Culture You might think that a lot of work goes into creating a high-energy workplace culture and that you don’t have the time or energy because you have a restaurant to run. But high energy is profitable. You already put a lot of effort into starting your business and you want it to flourish. Investing effort into the work environment you create has benefits that far outweigh the time and work you put into creating that environment. Increased Recruitment With an improved culture that has those already working there happy and excited to come to work, your effort when it comes time to bring on new staff will be easier. Your employer branding will have a good standing and those working there will recommend family and friends to join the team. Improved Retention There are a lot of options for people in today’s tight job market. If they do not like the job they are currently working at, they can easily go down the road and find another job. So, a positive, energized work environment that keeps them engaged just motivates them to return to you for their next shift instead of going online to look for another employer. Higher Profits Simply put, happy, energized workers make happy customers. When staff feels appreciated and enjoy coming to their workplace, it reflects in the service they provide to the customer or their performance in the back. And when customers have a great experience at your restaurant, they are more likely to return and recommend you to friends and colleagues. Final Thoughts Positive, energized staff will have your best interest in mind when they hit the timeclock and start working. Being a high-energy manager or business owner shows your staff that you walk the talk. Your own actions can not only improve your recruitment effort but will also motivate the staff you have now to work harder and smarter for you, growing your business in the process.

Despite the value of an onboarding new hire checklist, it is too often overlooked in the busy process of hiring new employees. If your business has a steady stream of new hires, it’s likely even harder to make sure the checklist is used correctly every time. However, it's not a good idea to let the onboarding procedure fall into a meaningless pile of paperwork. The checklist doesn't have to be long, boring, or frustrating to work well. It does, however, have to be informative and include some essential details. Here's what you need to know about how you can create and implement a checklist that will smooth out your onboarding process. Why is an Employee Onboarding Checklist Important? A good employment onboarding checklist is an essential element of the hiring process for a couple of important reasons. Once managers realize how much money and frustration a good checklist can solve, they make implementing an employee onboarding checklist a priority. Clarify Responsibilities An employee onboarding checklist lets new employees know what their role will be, how that role interacts with other employees, and where responsibilities lie. Without employment onboarding checklist procedures, it is much more likely that there will be disagreements between employees about responsibilities or lapses where a new employee didn't realize they were responsible for something important. Create Uniformity Across Training Having an onboarding new hire checklist maintains consistency across your new hires and your company, setting everyone up for a streamlined experience. Without this kind of consistency, employees will have different impressions of your business, which can lead to misunderstandings and difficulty feeling a shared company culture. Furthermore, a consistent onboarding process enables you to more accurately gauge how well employees are adapting and learning compared to an average, eliminating the onboarding process as a variable in employee performance. Avoid Lost Time If your company is like most, you dedicate a certain amount of time to training. If a new hire takes longer to train, it will cost not only the employee’s lost time, but also the lost time of whoever has to stop what they're doing to help them. A good onboarding process ensures as many questions as possible are answered and prevents gaps in understanding from creating confusion down the road. Characteristics of a Good Employment Onboarding Checklist Straightforward and to the point No longer than necessary, without unnecessary information Asks for feedback to verify that each step is being accomplished Organized into different stages of hiring and onboarding Flexible, able to be changed and adapted as onboarding needs change Consistent, able to be referenced down the road What Does an Employee Onboarding Checklist Include? A good onboarding new hire checklist isn’t something to fill out quickly on the new hire’s first day. It should be continuously incorporated from the beginning of the job search until the end of the onboarding process. Every checklist will include different elements depending on exactly what your business is and what the new hire’s job will be. However, here's an idea of what a good checklist might cover: Whatever Forms New Hires Might Need The hiring process inevitably includes a fair amount of paperwork you’ll need to prepare ahead of time. The employment onboarding checklist should cover a list of paperwork to prepare and arrange a folder for the new hire to have on their first day. Some documents might include: Contracts that need to be signed Tax documentation Information about payroll and how paychecks should be handled Benefits package Information about emergency contacts, mailing address, etc. A copy of the job description Welcome The New Employee Before They Arrive The first day is not the first time to begin significant communications with your new employee or with your business about the new employee. Make an announcement to your employees that there will be a new hire and in what area they'll be working. Send a thorough email to your new employee welcoming them and getting them acquainted with all of your procedures. This is a good time to assign a mentor to help the new hire navigate the onboarding process. A peer mentor can be a more neutral point of contact the new hire feels more comfortable talking to than a manager. Be sure to introduce the new hire to their peer mentor in the welcome email. Along with the welcome email, consider including any paperwork that doesn't need to be filled out at the workplace to get it out of the way early. Make Sure the New Hire’s Workspace is Ready When your new hire gets to work, you don't want to find out that their new computer needs to update for several hours or their office desk is malfunctioning. Make sure that you have a current employee try out the equipment and get everything ready so that the new hire can dive right into work. This preparation doesn't include just the physical aspects of the workspace. The employee needs to have access to keycodes for restricted areas of the building, passwords for digital folders and data, and whatever else is required for them to get to work. Setting up these kinds of passwords and user accounts can take some time, so make sure your onboarding list prompts IT to be contacted as soon as someone new is hired. Provide Guidelines for Shadowing A big part of most employees’ first couple of days is the tour and shadowing. This is an important step, during which a new hire learns about the physical location they're in, where they can access essential things like the water cooler, bathroom, break room, where to put food and drinks, etc. Unfortunately, shadowing often becomes an opportunity for employees to get to know each other. There's nothing wrong with that, but if information is being overlooked and the new hire doesn't know things they should have learned, this part of the onboarding process isn't being handled properly. The employee onboarding checklist should include information about exactly what needs to be covered during the tour and shadowing process, with informative steps that can be checked off one by one to be sure that the employees aren’t being distracted. Remind and Guide Check-ins An employment onboarding checklist doesn't stop when the first day is over. An effective checklist includes information about what will happen down the road. It's a good Idea to have a check-in at a week, a month, 60 days, and 90 days out. Make sure to ask the same questions at every check-in, for every employee, and ensure that the questions are as consistent as possible over time. Naturally, some questions will be different as time goes on, but it's a good idea to have many that are the same so you can get a sense of how your employee is handling the work over time. Here's an example of some good questions to ask at check-ins on day one and as the months go by: How is work life balance going for you? What could be done by the company to improve the balance, if anything? Are you confident of what your responsibilities are and feel able to meet them? If not, what do you feel is getting in the way? Do you feel that you work well with your teammates? What could be done to improve your relationships at work? An Employment Onboarding Checklist Makes Hiring Easier Regardless of the level of turnover in your business, hiring new employees is always somewhat stressful: for the new hire, for management, and for existing employees. An employee onboarding checklist is a great way to make sure that everybody is prepared for the new hire’s arrival and that every second of onboarding is used as effectively as possible. You want your new employees to be on the ground doing their job without delay. An onboarding new hire checklist is the best way to make that possible.

When you know how they feel about the workplace and what keeps them engaged, then you are better informed as to how to organize your company to keep people engaged and performing at their peak ability. You can find out more about how much employees care about their work with an employee engagement survey. What does an engaged employee look like? They could encompass any of the following qualities—usually, most or all of these apply. ·      They work hard, often over and above expectations. ·      They engage in positive communication, asking for and offering help. ·      They have a passion for the brand. ·      They exhibit company values at work and in their personal life. ·      Other employees gravitate toward them and look up to them. On the opposite end of the spectrum, disengaged employees pull undue amounts of energy from the team. They lower productivity and keep your company from being effective, efficient, and profitable. Even worse, their disengagement spreads out to others and can cause a negative domino effect that is difficult to recover from. So, how do you determine which employees are engaged and what keeps them that way? An employee engagement survey is the best way. Utilizing a collection of employee engagement questions regularly helps you as the boss, manager, or leadership team to understand employee morale and do what you can to keep it running high. Top Employee Engagement Survey Questions Before you hand out an employee engagement survey to your team, you need to compile a list of effective employee engagement survey questions. This survey should include plenty of areas that ask deep questions about an employee’s experiences, such as: ·      Satisfaction with their work ·      Alignment with company goals and values ·      Future goals and expectations ·      Relationships with colleagues and hierarchy ·      Understanding of expectations and duties Within each category (and your employee engagement survey should be fine-tuned to your exact company, employees, and unique setup), there can be any number of employee engagement questions that can help to accurately determine how engaged each worker is and where improvement might be required (on their end or yours). Use the following list as a jumping-off point to inspire you in creating employee engagement survey questions that effectively assess your workplace culture. Based on your own company’s structure and mission, you may want to include other sections or deeper questions on your employee engagement survey. Questions Concerning Satisfaction Employee satisfaction is often asked about in numbers or on a range, but in reality, it’s quite subjective. An employee determines how “satisfied” they are with their work based on several different aspects of their job. Therefore, you’ll need plenty of questions on your employee engagement survey that can give you a full picture of how each person feels. How do you feel about work right now? Focusing on the present moment is a great way to get to the heart of the matter and focus on how the employee is currently approaching their work. Although they might be feeling better or worse on the day they’re filling out the employee engagement survey than they usually do, this question opens up the conversation to larger talks about how and why feel the way they do. This is one of the most critical employee engagement questions because when your team knows that you truly care about how they feel, they are more likely to not only be engaged but to give their full effort and ask for help when necessary. Of course, you’ll often get a negative answer to this question. This is important to take with an open-minded attitude, though, because employees who are struggling to enjoy their work or put forth appropriate engagement can give you clues as to how to alter your management style or your workplace so that people better enjoy their work. Would you pass on job openings here to people you know? If an employee would encourage someone they care about to work for your organization, then it’s a good sign that they feel supported in their work. Getting a “yes” answer to this question on an employee engagement survey is a great sign that things are going well. Alternatively, if they wouldn’t want to “expose” someone to the current environment, that’s a sign that something needs to change—fast. How do you feel about getting out of bed each day to go to work? The phrase “case of the Mondays” became common because so many people dread going to work after a relaxing, freeing weekend. However, this isn’t always the case. Some people truly love their careers and enjoy being a part of a cohesive, supportive team. When you have highly engaged employees who look forward to tackling projects and furthering the mission each week and each day, that enthusiasm spreads to the rest of the team. When people aren’t engaged and look at work as drudgery, it gives you the space to ask how you can make working as an employee more fulfilling. Asking this question on an employee engagement survey can feel daunting, but if the answer isn’t what you’re looking for, know that it’s an opportunity to improve. Questions Concerning Company-Employee Alignment Every company should have a mission and a vision, which state what the organization is trying to do and how they go about accomplishing this. What is their goal and how do they want to be seen by the world? Employees aren’t always required to align with a company’s values, mission, and vision; however, when they are, they’ll be much more engaged and more likely to put forth a high level of work and positivity. Think about putting your company’s mission and vision statements at the top of each employee engagement survey, too. What do you find meaningful about your work? Research shows that people who know that their work has a greater purpose are more likely to be engaged and work above and beyond the expected norms. When work is meaningful, people are willing to put their heads down and get through tough times because they know they are valued and important. Do you feel recognized for your accomplishments? No matter what level an employee has attained or what type of work they do, they want recognition for their hard work. Studies show that receiving recognition for accomplishments is one of the biggest factors in people’s levels of engagement. Your employees probably don’t come right out and ask for your praises, though. Many people feel that seeking out praise is looked down upon, or they don’t want to be seen as only doing work for the affirmation. Thus, it’s your job as the leader to give it out without being asked. This employee engagement survey question can come with a set of sub-questions, too. Even though everyone wants praise, people respond best to different types. If you have a smaller group of employees and can differentiate recognition, ask questions on the employee engagement survey that lead you to understand which of the five ways your employees best receive affirmation. If you have a large organization, make sure that your recognition pulls from all of these to ensure that you hit everyone’s points. Words of affirmation (e.g., specific, detailed, one-on-one words, company-wide announcements about achievement, personalized thank you notes) Physical affirmation (e.g., high-fives, fist bumps, firm handshakes, eye contact) Quality time (e.g., lunch out on the company, pop-ins to someone’s office) Gifts (e.g., gift cards, gift baskets, small tokens of appreciation, company swag) Acts of service (e.g., leadership taking on lower-level work to help out, lightening someone’s load) Do you feel that your boss holds your success as a priority? Your employees are expected to come to work every day and give their best. When they feel that their boss wants them to succeed and will do what they can to help employees, it creates an environment that is well-suited to employee engagement . If you get answers that lean toward the negative here, you can show that you are invested in your employees’ success by asking them questions, checking in on projects, and offering your assistance. On the employee engagement survey and in everyday conversation, ask them what their short- and long-term goals are and follow up regarding what support they need to get there. Is the workplace culture supportive and comfortable? Sure, some people work well under pressure. However, working well under positive pressure (like a deadline for a big project that you’re proud of) is different from being asked to perform while being watched like a hawk or having more work piled on top of you with each passing day. People who respond positively to this question on an employee engagement survey are likely to feel that both their leadership team and their colleagues encourage and help them. They experience positive communication and answers of  “yes” when they ask for assistance. Employees whose values are in alignment with the company’s mission and vision are more likely to say that they feel their work environment is positive, too. After reading the employee engagement questions, ask yourself what you’ve done to create an inclusive, tolerant workplace and where you can improve in that area to foster greater employee engagement. Questions Concerning an Employee’s Future and Goals One of a company’s biggest expenses is often employee turnover. It can cost tens of thousands of dollars each year to recruit, onboard, and train new employees, as well as to give human resources support and/or severance packages to those who haven’t been treated fairly. When you use an employee engagement survey to measure how satisfied an employee is and to ask them what they envision for their future, it lets them know that you want them as a part of the team and prepares them for what lies ahead. Where do you see yourself employed in a year? Millions of Americans leave their jobs each month and even more consider it. The last two years during the pandemic have given rise to even more people considering other positions that offer more work-from-home flexibility and greater fulfillment. When you open up this question, employees can feel comfortable sharing their honest feelings, whether or not that means staying on board with your company. If they see themselves somewhere else, be sure to ask them what is keeping them from wanting to stay with you. Could the environment be more supportive? Is there potential for upward movement? Are they challenged and given gratitude at the same time? Do your duties challenge you and are you supported in what you want to do? There’s a difference between a job and a career. Jobs are something that people do to earn a paycheck, nothing more. Careers offer stimulation, challenge, promotions, and opportunities for growth and development. To attain these, employees need leadership that is going to support them on their climb up the ladder. People see right through busy work and fake challenges. To nurture employees who truly care about their work and want to give their best, ask them questions on an employee engagement survey about how you can support them in their career desires. How can we support you in achieving your potential here? Do you see a path for your growth? It’s commonly heard in the workplace to “dress for the job you want, not for the one you have.” This also applies to how employees talk to and interact with each other, and how much engagement they put into their work. However, when they don’t feel that there is any upward movement or anyone who wants to see them succeed, there’s no reason for them to continue putting out significant effort. Don’t be afraid to have employees that want to grow and rise to new heights within your company. When you have people who are reaching higher, it’s a sign that you are influencing them for good. Conclusion A well-written employee engagement survey can help you understand who wants to give more to the company and how you can support those people in achieving their goals. It will show you who is aligned with the company and who needs more support so that they can positively engage with the team. Employee engagement survey questions are meant to elicit deep, meaningful answers and conversations, that push your company and team toward growth.

Furthermore, a workplace of engaged employees is often a more pleasant place to be. But how do you get your employees to feel more engaged? Here are some employee engagement ideas that can help you get a more engaged workforce without having to flip your business model on end or dramatically increase benefits. In fact, as you'll see from these team engagement ideas, sometimes the most inexpensive and simplest ideas are the most effective. Is it Worth Investing in Team Engagement Ideas? It already takes a lot of effort to keep employees on the payroll and coming to work, so do you really need to invest more time into coming up with ideas for team engagement? You may be surprised by how easy these employee engagement ideas are to implement. Some of them are more of a mindset adjustment than they are a change in your business practices. It's well worth looking into at least a few employee engagement ideas, because an engaged workforce is worth the extra effort. Engaged employees are more likely to have: Greater productivity with more effort put into their work Fewer absences, sick days, and late clock-ins A longer period working at the company overall Better communication with managers and other departments What Engages Your Employees? You won't make much progress in coming up with good employee engagement ideas if you don't know what interests and passions your employees have. After all, not all ideas for team engagement will work for all employees. Different employees in different lines of work have different motivations. Communicate with your employees to learn exactly what they find most engaging. Employee Engagement Ideas for Work 1. Communicate Do your employees rarely fill out surveys or respond with more than a few words when you ask them what they think about their work? If you asked your employees’ friends and loved ones what the employee thinks about work, do you think you’d find that your employee does in fact have an opinion? The fact is that every employee has ideas about their job; how it can be improved, likes and dislikes, and ideas about their co-workers. Don't settle for a blank survey. Keep looking for ways to communicate with your employees and learn more about what they think about your company. 2. Reward Behavior, Not Just Accomplishments It's easy for most companies to reward employees who do an exceptional job. However, it's a lot more difficult to reward employees for their efforts. Employees who consistently work hard and follow your company values but never manage to achieve something worthy of a pat on the back can become discouraged. Reward your employees for the values that your company esteems and their efforts to work in line with them, not just for the big ticket sales or perfect attendance. 3. Have Fun Together Play is an integral part of the human bonding and social experience. Having fun with one another can make employees more comfortable together and make it easier for them to work well together. There are as many opportunities to have fun as a team as you and your employees can think of. Pizza Fridays, Dress Down Tuesdays, and company lunches are just some of the opportunities for having fun as a company. 4. Encourage Employees to Have Fun on Their Own Time There's a limit to how many paid employee hours you can commit to spending on having fun. However, you can incentivize your employees to socialize with outings. Offer your employees tickets to a concert or a discount to a local restaurant in hopes that they'll go together. This can be an affordable way for you to build a company culture without using paid company hours. 5. Encourage Employees to Work Together in New Ways Depending on what kind of company you have, your employees may or may not have opportunities to work together closely on a regular basis. However, even if your employees are accustomed to working together, giving them a different kind of project to pour their efforts into can lead to new growth and engagement. For instance, restaurant employees may be perfectly used to handling the dinner rush together, but encouraging them to work together to decorate the dining room for a special event can encourage them to engage in new ways. 6. Care About Your Employees’ Personal Lives Too often, even employees who are extremely engaged with their work end up becoming dispirited and leaving because they can't balance the job they love with their personal interests and passions. Make your employees' personal lives a priority, and you are likely to keep them longer. Don't be stingy with PTO, schedule with your employees’ priorities in mind, and do all you can to accommodate personal crises. Employees who feel their workplace is engaged in their lives are more likely to be engaged at work. 7. Offer Mobility Within the Workplace Your employees may not always be interested in the job you hired them for, but that doesn't mean that the efforts you put into training them and onboarding them need to be wasted. It also doesn't mean you need to push someone into a promotion just so you don't lose them. You can enable lateral mobility in your company, allowing your employees to try out different roles and pursue their own interests at your company. This kind of crosstraining can actually be hugely beneficial for the company, since more employees can fill more roles. It also keeps employees more engaged, as it helps them find what kind of work they want to do. 8. Give Back to the Community Your employees are likely to feel more engaged with your company if your company engages with its community. Younger generations are especially committed to giving back and feeling that the businesses they interact with, whether they're working for them or buying from them, are making a positive difference in the world. Choose a philanthropic cause that makes sense for your company. Remain involved with it, and encourage employees to do the same on company time. 9. Invest in Employee Wellness Healthier people are more likely to be engaged in everything they do, including work. Furthermore, by showing you care about your employees' health and wellness, you are likely to inspire loyalty. Many companies misspend on wellness because they aren't sure how to make the investment. A ping pong table or a couple of pieces of gym equipment that are only used by one employee at a time, once in awhile, aren't likely to do the trick. Instead, offer employees access to counseling services for mental health, provide free or reduced-price gym memberships, or have health savings plans for your employees. 10. Create a Mentoring System For the most part, employees at most businesses stay in their own lanes, rarely interacting with other employees, particularly employees with different levels of skill. However, a mentoring system can be a superb way for employees to learn from one another and feel more invested in their team and in the business. Connect a more experienced employee with a newer hire so that they can teach them and serve as a formal helper within the workplace. This can also be a great way to gather important information about employee satisfaction since employees are often more likely to talk to one another than to managers. 11. Nurture Your Company Culture Company culture is delicate and difficult to control. After hours of team-building exercises, encouraging the kind of values you want to see, and striving to build a particular culture for your company, just a couple of new employees with a bad attitude or an argument between existing employees can turn it all on its head. Company culture isn't something that can be accomplished with a couple of posters on the wall and a meeting once a month. You need to be proactive about the culture that is developing in your company and pay attention to what is coloring it. The wrong kind of company culture can be one of the fastest drivers of a drop in employee morale. 12. Encourage Your Employees, Even if You’re Encouraging Them Out There comes a time for every employer when they have a star employee they’d love to keep, but know they are going to lose. How you respond to this moment can make a big difference for not only the employee in question but for the company as a whole. It may seem counterintuitive to nurture a star employee out of your company. However, it's important to remember that other employees will be well aware of the contribution you made to helping your employee chase their passions. Having your employees become so successful that they go on to bigger and better things is a great way to keep current employees more engaged. 13. Be Humble Proud, unshakable management is difficult to connect with. Employees are more likely to feel engaged at work if management not only asks for but acts on feedback. Making a big change to procedure or changing your mind about something important is a powerful way to show employees that their opinions can make a difference. However, even if it's something small, like employees wanting different decorations or a change in office music, listening to what your employees want and making changes is a powerful driver of engagement. 14. Mark the Passage of Time For many employees, work can feel like a steady drag as the years go by. Personal life is marked by holidays, birthdays, and milestones of personal accomplishments. However, too often, nothing breaks up the years at work. It's natural that employees become disengaged in such a monotonous environment. Mark the passage of time by celebrating your employees’ birthdays and holidays together. Mark anniversaries that employees have been with the company and celebrate milestones, even if they're not work-related. 15. Provide Opportunities For Leadership Not every employee at your company will be a manager or overseer, but that doesn't mean that they can't lead. Leadership is one of the primary causes for engagement in any kind of work. Not every employee will be engaged as a leader in every area of what they do, but every employee can be the leader of something. Put employees in charge of planning parties or meetings, encourage an employee to lead a morning exercise routine, etc. Learn about your employees and what they care about and excel in, and give them opportunities to lead in those areas within your company, even if only in something small or temporary. 16. Remind Your Employees What They're Working For Most people, regardless of their careers, want to feel that what they're doing matters. Even the employees with the least responsibilities at your company still have an important role to play. Emphasize the value of every role at your company. Make sure everyone feels a sense of accomplishment when the company does well. Mark improvements in your company's worth, an especially good pace of production, an excellent lunch rush, or a mistake-free day. It's great if you can celebrate with a little party or reward, but even just calling out the fact that employee efforts have led to success is incredibly valuable. 17. Eliminate Unnecessary Processes One of the biggest pain points for many employees is the steps they go through every day that they know are not accomplishing anything. Employees who have to engage in repetitive processes that could just as easily be automated by a computing system or machine have a more difficult time believing their work is meaningful. Talk to your employees about the processes they go through every day and determine whether they think that all of the effort they're putting in is worth it. You may find ways to not only increase employee engagement but also eliminate wasted steps that are costing unnecessary time and money. Enable Your Employees to be More Engaged Regardless of how much of an investment you can afford to make into employee engagement, at least a couple of the items on this list are sure to help you to develop a more passionate and engaged workforce. You don't have to spend a lot of money or revamp the entire human resources department to engage your workforce. Just be humble, think carefully about what matters to your employees, and treat each of them as an individual with a lot to offer your company.

They aren't machines that can be given a command and just run with it for eternity. They are real people that need to be nurtured and respected if you want to get the most out of them. Failure to do so can lead to a demotivated workforce that's inefficient and prone to high turnover. An excellent way to ensure you get the best out of your staff are employee engagement programs. This article will explain exactly what these programs are and how you can use them to get the most out of your team. What is employee engagement? Employee engagement refers to the level of commitment a person feels towards their employer.  It's usually expressed in terms of employee satisfaction and employee loyalty. A highly engaged employee is one who feels valued by their employer, is inspired to go above and beyond for the business through their own volition. The key here is that engagement cannot be coerced out of the person, it has to be inspired. Why does it matter? The difference between an engaged employee and a disengaged employee can be the difference between success and failure for a business. And this difference is seen across all areas, not just pure productivity. Engaged workers are less likely to be injured at work, less likely to take time off sick and less likely to quit. Your workforce is also the core of your company culture, so it doesn't matter how nice your office looks, how cool your break room is or how many bean bag chairs you own; if your employees are disengaged, your company culture will be toxic. What is an employees engagement program? Employee engagement programs are designed to stimulate employee motivation, morale, and enthusiasm. They typically involve activities such as employee recognition, competitions, rewards and incentives to reward staff for exceptional performance. These programs are tailored to meet the specific needs of the business and are designed to increase employee satisfaction, employee loyalty and productivity. Now, it's important to understand that engagement programs for employees can't simply be bought. Providing benefits for employees is a great thing but that's not the same as an employee engagement program. To create real engagement, you need to take a holistic approach that looks at employee communication, employee development, employee recognition and more. 13 Employee engagement programs you can implement There are a number of different engagement strategies you can employ, but here are some of the top employee engagement programs used by the most successful companies. 1) Coaching If you want your staff to really invest in your business, then it's important that your business invests in them too. Coaching sessions should be focused entirely on the employee's development and should not be conflated with training which is all about the company. The person should walk away from these sessions feeling that they got value out of them personally. 2) Employee appreciation Recognizing employees for the work they do is an excellent way to ensure employee engagement. You could give out awards or rewards, hold employee appreciation events or even just write notes to employees acknowledging the work they do and how they contribute to the team. 3) Employee surveys The only way to really understand employee sentiment is to ask them directly. Through employee surveys you can gain a real insight into employee engagement levels, and use that data to inform employee engagement strategies. 4) Provide feedback It doesn't matter how much of a self-starter an employee is, without regular feedback, it's easy to become confused, lost and ultimately disengaged. A big mistake that many managers make is only providing feedback when there is an issue. If an employee only hears from their manager when things are going wrong then they will quickly start to associate contact with management as a negative. People won't trust their managers and will become disengaged. 5) Encourage employee ownership Giving employees autonomy to make decisions and taking the time to listen to their ideas can make all the difference when it comes to employee engagement. By encouraging employees to take ownership of their work, you're allowing them to show off their skills and take pride in their work. You also create a real sense of \"skin in the game\". Workers will be working on their own projects rather than just something handed down to them by the company. This creates an opportunity to engage in employee appreciation and employee recognition. 6) Flexible working The pandemic smashed the preconceived notions that we always need to be in the office to get any work done. Many employees now expect some level of flexible working and it would be wise to grant this to them. Again, this is not a benefit or bribe to convince them to work harder. Instead, this  is a show of trust and respect for your worker's time. You are taking the time to understand employee preferences and showing them that you value them as people, not just workers. 7) Create leadership access channels A chain of command is not a one way road. If an employee needs to speak with their manager then it should be easy for them to do so. Having access channels and open communication between employees and leadership is essential for employee engagement. This could be done in the form of office hours or perhaps a weekly forum. It doesn't need to be a constant open door policy, but it is vital that workers have regular access to leadership. As a way to get employees to buy into the company culture, these communication channels don't necessarily need to be focused purely on work. These sessions can also involve coaching and leadership seminars that implicitly preach the values and mission of the business. 8) Fix the onboarding process The first weeks and months of a worker's experience with your business are probably the most important. This is when a person makes their mind up about the company they have joined and will likely define the relationship between the worker and the business. This means that everything from training to cultural immersion needs to be done as best as possible. It is imperative that onboarding is done well or employee engagement might never happen at all. It's much harder to get buy-in from a jaded employee than a fresh faced one. 9) Create a transparent work environment It's next to impossible to care about something you don't understand. If an employee feels they are nothing more than a cog in a machine, how can they be expected to really engage in their work? An environment that's transparent and honest will help employees understand their role in the company. They should be aware of what's going on, why certain projects are being done and how their role fits into the company. 10) Create a safe work environment All the other ideas we've explored are essentially pointless if you have a toxic environment. People need to feel safe and comfortable in their work environment. This means having employee support programs in place, as well as making sure there is zero tolerance for bullying and harassment. People need to be able to trust each other and the company in order for employee engagement programs to work. 11) Put your values to the forefront Far too many businesses treat values as some kind of lip service that they are expected to have, but the reality is people can see right through that. You need to be honest about your values and really show that they mean something. For example, if the environment is part of your mission statement, then there's a good chance that candidates may join because they share the same values. You cannot then turn around and refuse to do any recycling because it's inconvenient. This hypocrisy of your company values will instantly turn workers off. Instead, you need to put your values to the forefront, both in employee engagement programs and in the day to day operation of the business. 12) Provide perks Including things like pizza on Fridays or free gym membership may not seem that important, but in reality, they are the cherry on top of employee engagement programs. People don't necessarily expect them, but when businesses provide these little extras it can really hammer home the idea that employee engagement is important. It's also a great way to show your employees that their contribution and hard work are appreciated. Just remember that perks should not be a substitute for real compensation. If your competitors are offering a better compensation or benefits package, then no amount of morning yoga is going to sway employee engagement in the long run. 13) Empower employee led initiatives Finally, if you want to really engage your employees, then you need to allow them to take leadership roles. This could be things like employee led workshops or committees that determine different aspects of company initiatives. It could even be something as basic as giving workers the opportunity to suggest and vote on ideas to improve employee engagement. Summary A business that is able to engage their employees will always have an x-factor that their competitors can only dream of. It leads to better productivity, lower turnover and an all around happier environment. The key to employee engagement is to create an environment where people feel safe, empowered, appreciated and understand their role. This can be achieved through employee engagement programs that focus on communication, transparency, values and employee-led initiatives.

And if you’re managing hiring across multiple locations, you may have an even hazier picture of how things are going across the board. That’s where data comes to the rescue. With the right hiring technology and data at your disposal, you can discover which sourcing strategies are working and which ones aren’t, which of your locations are struggling and why, where bottlenecks are, and one of our favorite metrics: how long it takes you to hire, or as we call it, your time-to-hire (TTH) . No matter what applicant tracking system (ATS) or human capital management (HCM) system you’re using, here are the metrics you should be tracking to ensure your hiring process is working. Hiring performance by source There are lots of ways to source applicants, from posting on job boards and sponsoring local events to running employee referral programs and hanging up hiring posters. And while you can do it all (and in some cases, you should), you can fine-tune your sourcing strategy by looking at what’s working across different positions and even locations. From there, you can use the data to optimize. Maybe one job board performs better for a certain position than others. You might consider sponsoring your job posting on this board. Or maybe you find that applicants engage with hiring posters on your front door more than anywhere else within your business. This might be a good opportunity to cut the other hiring signs and invest the savings in an even more attractive door poster. Hiring performance by position Some positions are harder to hire for than others. Similarly, some locations might have a harder time hiring a position because of the skills and interests of the local population. The best way to see where your gaps are across your business is to view hiring performance by position. This data is also especially helpful when anticipating future hiring needs. If you know certain positions take longer to hire for, you can bake that into your hiring timeline and set realistic goals. For example, if you see that cashiers take an average of eight days to hire, don’t build your timeline around the unrealistic expectation that you can hire in four. With high turnover and busy seasons often putting pressure on hiring managers to fill positions fast, having real data on hiring performance by position can help you prepare. Time spent in stages We all know that when it comes to hiring hourly workers, speed is everything. Employers want to hire faster, and workers want to get hired faster. When reviewing your overall hiring performance, a great place to dive in deeper is the time spent in the hiring stages. You’re looking for no more than a couple of days in each stage. This is not only a good indicator of how fast you’re moving people through the hiring process, but it’s also a look into your applicant experience. In the deskless economy, making applicants wait days is like a death sentence. These workers are applying to six jobs at a time on average, and spoiler alert, they’re most likely to go with the one that bites first. If you’re leaving applicants in a hiring stage for too long, you risk them finding another job first, or worse, getting a negative opinion of your brand altogether. Interacted with or not The stage that’s arguably the most important is the first one: Time in application stage. Another way to dissect performance at the beginning of your hiring process is to look at applicant interaction (we call it the Interacted with metric). This will tell you whether your hiring managers have responded to an application or not and how fast they respond to applications. It shouldn’t come as a big surprise that the hiring process is often just as frustrating (if not more) for applicants as it is for employers. Never is this more apparent than when a business suggests its hiring needs are urgent, yet it takes them days or weeks to respond to applications. We’ve found that employers who contact candidates within an hour of receiving their application have a 25% higher chance of hiring. That’s a big opportunity to improve your hiring performance. Not only does a quick response keep applicants focused on your opportunity, but it helps move your hiring process forward to the screening and interview scheduling stages. Time-to-hire If you only have time to review one metric, review your time-to-hire. This one metric gives you a bird's eye view of your hiring performance as a whole. The lower the number of days, the better because, as we’ve said before, speed is critical to hiring hourly workers. If this number is trending on the high side, it’s time to review the other metrics above and see where your process is breaking down. Leave no doubt you’re hitting your hiring goals Without a data-informed hiring strategy in place, businesses are practically operating in the dark and unaware of the big picture—making it difficult to optimize the hiring process and get results. We’ve recently updated our custom reporting features to give you all the data above, plus the ability to customize reports and schedule recurring reports delivered directly to your inbox.

But it takes more than standing up an account and publishing a “now hiring” post to attract applicants. Businesses across a variety of industries have seen success creating content that engages fans while also enticing prospective employees. If being creative on social media sounds like something you don’t have time for, know that you don’t have to recreate the wheel. Here are some proven post formats for engaging applicants and customers alike: A day in the life One of the most popular ways businesses are showing up on social media today is through a day in the life videos. This genre of social post gives viewers a unique behind-the-scenes look at your business and what it would be like to work there. Whether it’s a brand viewers love or a job they’ve never seen done before, these videos are so shareable that some have even gone viral. The Walt Disney Company Take inspiration from brands that do this well. One such example is The Walt Disney Company ( @disneyparks on TikTok ). In a more obvious push to source applicants, they posted a day in the life from the perspective of one of their lifeguards with a clear call for viewers to apply. @disneyparks Our lifeguards know how to make a splash! 🛟 #Disney #DisneyParks #DisneyWorld #DisneyCastLife #Lifeguard #LifeguardTikTok #JobFair ♬ original sound - Disney Parks Their get ready with me videos give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at performers preparing for work while talking about what they like about their job and how they get their start in the art. @disneyparks Get ready with me @cirquedusoleil artist edition ✏️✨ #Disney #DisneyParks #DisneyWorld #DisneySprings #DrawnToLife #CirqueDuSoleil #GetReadyWithMe #GRWM ♬ original sound - Disney Parks They also post videos showing employees making popular food items at the park , which is a fun way to show off the work a role is responsible for while also getting customers excited to come try your products. @disneyparks Cake Shake, CAKE Shake, CAKE SHAKE! 🍰🍦 🍰🍦 #Disney #DisneyParks #Disneyland #CaliforniaAdventure #Cake #Milkshake #IceCream #Dessert #TikTokFood ♬ original sound - Disney Parks McDonald’s McDonald's takes a unique approach to food preparation videos. On Linkedin, they show some of their chefs trying out new recipes suggested by the fans. Not only does this encourage fans to continue engaging with their brand, but it also shows prospective applicants the fun side of working there. Now your turn Create your own a day in the life posts by capturing videos of: Hour-by-hour timelapse from open to close Employees interacting with customers Employees giving a tour of the facility Employees sharing their favorite “hacks” What it’s like during the night shift vs. the day shift The lunch or dinner rush Employees demoing a unique tool used on the job Employees sharing their favorite parts of their job Employees debunking rumors about the job Employee shoutouts Give shoutouts on social media to people who join your team or employees doing an amazing job. Your team members will feel compelled to reshare these posts to their own followers, effectively widening the reach. It’s also great to show prospective employees and customers that you appreciate your staff. Chick-fil-A Chick-fil-A does this well by consistently posting close-up, high-resolution photos of their employees on their Instagram page. The accompanying captions also often carry a friendly tone, with interactive elements which encourage followers to respond (effectively bumping up engagement scores too!). One such example is 'What's your go-to order?', which prompted fans to reply with their favorites. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chick-fil-A, Inc. (@chickfila) Now your turn Highlighting your employees is a great way to humanize your brand and celebrate your team—while also showing applicants what kind of team they could be joining. Consider sharing: Quick employee bios Employee anniversaries Employee of the month Employees going above and beyond Great customer feedback about an employee Employee perks and benefits The competition over hourly workers has pushed businesses to overhaul everything from pay to perks in hopes of attracting more applicants . And while you’re probably showcasing these benefits on your job postings, don’t forget to share them on social media too. Not only does this entice prospective employees, but it also shows your customers that you’re a good employer and boosts your brand’s reputation. Chick-fil-A Chick-fil-A annually awards select team members with its Remarkable Futures scholarship and shares photos of the winners . This feel-good post gets employees sharing why they love working for the brand, earning it even more good publicity. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chick-fil-A, Inc. (@chickfila) Wendy's Special company events can also entice prospective applicants by giving them a look at your company culture. Wendy's recently posted a photo from their in-person onboarding event , which was a great opportunity to show the emphasis the company puts on building their community, while also giving fans a look at what it’s like to join the Wendy’s team. Now your turn The best way to highlight your business’ unique perks and benefits is to share them from the perspective of your employees. It allows you to promote your perks with real-life examples. Consider the following perks and some ways you can authentically post about them: Paid time off: Share a vacation photo and a quote from an employee about why this vacation was special to them Education reimbursement: Share a photo or video of an employee learning or demonstrating a skill they learned using their reimbursement Childcare services: Everyone loves cute kids! If your employees are comfortable with it, have them share a photo of their kids in your brand’s gear and allow the employee to caption it. Charitable donations : If your team participates in charity activities together, capture those moments and share how you’re giving back to your community together. Ready to get started? There are many ways to attract hourly ways through social media, and these are just a few examples to get you started. Look into what makes your brand and business stand out from your competitors and showcase it. And don’t forget to let your employees be the stars and even create the content for you!

But what if we told you that encouraging employees to post about their jobs can be an almost effortless part of your hiring strategy? With social media use more prevalent than ever before , especially among Gen Z and Millenials, platforms like Facebook, Instagram , and TikTok are becoming the best places to attract new employees to your business. In fact, 86% of job seekers turn to social media when job hunting. So while you should have some guardrails in place around on-the-job social media use to ensure employees are supporting your business (instead of getting sucked into scrolling), encouraging employees to capture their work environment on social media can be a great hiring tool. When it comes to getting your employees involved with social media recruiting, there are two ways to go about it: get employees to post directly on your company’s social account (hello, employee takeovers!) or have your employees post to their personal accounts, tagging your business. Either way, getting employees involved in generating content has two major advantages. Authenticity Creating storytelling pieces such as day in the life videos provides a compelling, unbiased view of the job and company culture through the eyes of your employees. Positive work culture is one of the top criteria job seekers look for when job hunting. So, such content may attract like-minded individuals to apply for a job in your company. It also lets job seekers in on what a job is like and what it entails, helping them manage their expectations about the job. And when a job meets the expectations of your new hires, you can hope for higher retention rates in the long run too! Reach Aside from showing a more authentic side of your company, involving your employees in your social media recruiting strategy can also get your content a wider audience. Whether your employees are posting directly from their own accounts and tagging you or posting through your business account and resharing to their own, cross-promoting content is the easiest way to expand your audience. And if your employees are featured or creating the content, they’ll be more likely to share it. This is exactly what Walmart is doing. The retail giant has an exclusive program called Spotlight that’s dedicated to turning its workers into small-scale influencers for the company. Under this program, employees show behind-the-scenes of their jobs and even promote some of the new services Walmart offers. Now, imagine doing the same but for your hiring campaigns! Time Coming up with creative content that attracts prospective employees can take a lot of work. But your employees live and breathe social media. Coming up with on-trend content comes naturally and quickly to them. By pulling them into the social media recruiting process, you make it easier to collect tons of posts and schedule them out in advance, saving you time without sacrificing quality. If you don’t have a social media account for your company, check out our article to get some tips on how you can get started ! But if you already do, read on to find out how you can leverage your team to create amazing social content for your platforms. How to encourage your employees to post work-related content Make it a part of their work schedule The easiest way to get your employees to create social media recruiting content is to build that responsibility into their work. Put a chart in the break room and have employees earn rewards for creating a certain amount of content during a set time period, or reward employees that create content that has high engagement rates. You can even create “social shifts;” an extra hour a week where employees come in solely to work on social content creation. But before jumping right into it, ensure that you impose some guidelines on the social media content they can share. Here are some you can start off with: Create a list of do’s and don’ts so their content won’t spark any negative backlash Share some brand style guidelines, such as how to use your brand logo correctly Create an approval process so you get eyes on content before its posted Give recognition to your employees on your personal accounts Actions speak louder than words, so don’t just encourage your employees to post but also do so on your account. For example, you can give a shoutout to top performers or repost their work-related content to show your appreciation. Doing so not only encourages your employees to post on their respective social media platforms but also helps to build a personal brand for yourself, which is important as it gives a more personable impression of you as a business owner. Thus, when users see such content, they are more likely to recommend their peers to your company as they view you as a supportive boss who creates a good environment for their workers. Provide referral benefits Sometimes, nothing works better than giving additional benefits! If your employee has a good following, encourage them to post about open positions on their personal platforms. Let it be known to your team that a referral benefit will be rewarded should someone get hired and retained through their social post. Don’t forget to create a system that makes it easy for you to track the referrers so that the right people get rewarded! Leverage hourly employees to create social media content In this digital age, social media can be a useful hiring tool for you to attract and reach out to job seekers. Many hourly employees are already turning to social media to post about their days on the job, though in most cases, this content isn’t officially vetted by the company or cross-promoted. Take advantage of your team’s social savviness to attract more employees like them. After all, if you can trust them enough to handle your business, you should trust them to post content on your social platforms. Want to learn more about sourcing hourly workers through social media?

The purpose of an HRMS is to automate and streamline human resources-related tasks, such as payroll processing, benefits administration, and personnel tracking. In this guide, we provide an in-depth look at HRMSs and discuss the key features that you should look for when choosing a system for your business. What is HRMS? As we mentioned, an HRMS is a software application designed to automate and streamline human resources-related tasks. The core purpose of an HRMS is to help businesses manage employee data more efficiently. By automating HR processes, businesses can save time and money on administrative tasks and focus on more strategic initiatives. There are a number of different types of HRMS on the market, and they vary in terms of features and functionality. Some HRMS are designed for specific industries, while others offer more general-purpose tools. When choosing an HRMS for your business, it’s important to consider your business’ specific needs and requirements. HRIS vs HRMS While many people use the terms HRIS and HRMS interchangeably, there is a difference between the two. An HRIS (human resources information system) is a system that stores employee data. An HRMS, on the other hand, is a system that helps you manage that employee data. In other words, an HRIS is a database of employee information, while an HRMS is a tool that you use to manipulate and act on that data. Most HRMS will include an HRIS component, as employee data is the foundation of any HR system. However, not all HRIS will offer the same level of functionality as an HRMS. When evaluating HRMS, it’s important to consider the features and tools that each system offers. History of HRMS Human resource management systems can be traced back to the 1970s when the first attempts to automate payroll functions were put into practice. These primitive systems would lay the groundwork for the development of more sophisticated HRMS in the years to follow. PeopleSoft introduced one of the first comprehensive HRMS in the 1980s, which included elements like recruiting, attendance, and even benefits administration. By 2000, the practice had finally hit mainstream relevance within corporate structures as direct deposit and employee self-service had become fully adopted. And since then, the HRMS market has continued to grow and evolve. New technologies such as cloud computing and mobile devices are changing the way businesses operate and requiring HRMS to evolve with changing customer needs. As businesses' needs change, so will the HRMS they use. Types of human resource management systems There are several different types of HRMS on the market, and they vary in features and functionality. Some HRMS are designed for specific industries, while others offer more general-purpose tools. When choosing an HRMS for your business, it’s important to consider your specific needs and requirements; Industry-specific HRMS Some human resource management systems are designed for specific industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing, or retail. These systems offer industry-specific features and tools that can be helpful for businesses in those industries. For example, a healthcare HRMS might include tools for managing compliance with HIPAA regulations. General-purpose HRMS Other HRMS offer more general-purpose tools that can be used by businesses in any industry. These systems might not include industry-specific features, but they can still be helpful for businesses of all types. Cloud-based HRMS Cloud-based systems are hosted by the cloud vendor, and they can be accessed via the internet. Cloud-based HRMS can be helpful for businesses that don’t have the resources to host their own HRMS. On-premises HRMS On-premises HRMS are hosted on the customer’s own servers. On-premises systems can be helpful for businesses that want to have more control over their HRMS. Open-source HRMS Open-source HRMS are free to use, and they can be customized to meet the needs of your business. Open-source HRMS are typically hosted on the customer’s own servers. Proprietary HRMS Proprietary HRMS are developed and owned by a single vendor. Proprietary systems are typically not customizable, and they may be more expensive than other types of HRMS. Why companies should invest in HRMS An HRMS can automate and streamline a few different HR functions, including payroll, benefits administration, and performance management. By automating these processes, an HRMS can save businesses time and money. In addition, an HRMS can help businesses manage their workforce better. There are many benefits you can expect to see when you implement an HRMS. These benefits include; Better, data-driven insights One of the clearest benefits of an HRMS is the ability to gain insights into your workforce that were not possible before. With an HRMS, you can track employee data and use that data to make better decisions about your workforce. Improved compliance Compliance is a never-ending struggle when it comes to HR. By automating HR processes with an HRMS, you can ensure compliance and do away with errors that come about via a manual approach. Reduced costs An HRMS can help reduce the costs associated with HR functions, such as payroll and benefits administration. In addition, an HRMS can help you better manage your workforce, which can lead to reduced turnover and improved productivity. Improved employee satisfaction An HRMS can help improve employee satisfaction by automating HR processes and making it easier for employees to access the information they need. In addition, an HRMS can help you better manage your workforce, which can lead to improved employee morale. Small business HRMS for small business owners is very effective and enables organization and time savings when a small business owner is short on bandwidth. Freeing up this time that a business owner would normally be spending on HR can mean more time for strategy and more needle-moving activities. What are the key functions of an HRMS? While HRMS can vary and will certainly have some level of individuality, there are some core functions you can usually expect. Workforce management Perhaps the cornerstone of any decent HRMS is a workforce management function. This refers to the general overseeing of your workforce and would include everything from development to discipline. Why it matters: Workforce management is critical for every business. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your workforce and can help you save time and money. Payroll Another key function of an HRMS is payroll management . This refers to the process of managing employee pay, including calculating wages, taxes, and deductions. While this may be as simple as basic payroll records, it can be as complex as managing overtime, labor laws, benefits, and even calculating taxation. Why it matters: Payroll is one of the most important aspects of HR. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage payroll and can help you save time and money. Employee management Employee management refers to what most people would consider when they think about HR functions. This would encompass everything from reporting on the relationship between employees and management to the basic structure of your employee’s work life, such as which location they work out of. Why it matters: Employee management is critical for every business. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your workforce and can help you improve employee morale. Recruitment The process of recruitment can be a daunting one, but an HRMS can make it much simpler. This would include everything from posting job ads to conducting interviews and managing the hiring process . Why it matters: Recruitment is a critical part of HR. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your recruitment process and can help you find the best candidates for your business. Employee engagement Employee engagement is a relatively new term, but it’s gaining a lot of traction in the HR world. Employee engagement refers to the level of connection an employee feels to their work and their company. This can be anything from job satisfaction to company loyalty. And the best way to manage employee engagement is by regularly conducting engagement surveys to keep a pulse on how your workers are feeling. Why it matters: Employee engagement is critical for every business. A good HRMS can help you to improve employee engagement and can lead to improved employee morale. What are the key features of an HRMS? Now that we’ve provided clarity on the overriding functions of an HRMS let’s look at the individual features you can expect. Reporting and analytics One of the most important features of an HRMS is reporting and analytics . The system should provide you with data that can help you to make decisions about your workforce. This data can be anything from employee productivity to turnover rates. Why it matters : Reporting and analytics are critical for every business. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your workforce and can help you save time and money. Centralized employee records A basic feature that you can expect from most HRMS is the ability to store employee records in a centralized location. This is important because it helps streamline the process of managing employee data. Why it matters: Having a centralized database of employee information can save you a lot of time and hassle. It also means you can easily access employee records from anywhere in the world. Performance management Another key feature of an HRMS is performance management. This refers to the ability of the system to help you track and manage employee performance. This can include anything from setting goals to tracking progress. Why it matters: Performance management is important for any business that wants to improve employee productivity. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage employee performance and can help you improve your bottom line. Time and attendance tracking Many HRMS also offer time and attendance tracking features. This refers to the ability of the system to track when employees start and finish work, as well as their break times. Why it matters: Time and attendance tracking ensures accurate recording of work hours, which directly impacts payroll accuracy and compliance with labor laws. This feature helps prevent timekeeping errors and disputes while also providing valuable insights for optimizing scheduling and labor costs. Benefits administration Another common feature of HRMS is benefits administration. This refers to the ability of the system to help you manage employee benefits. This can include anything from health insurance to pension plans. Why it matters: Benefits administration is crucial in HRMS because it ensures that hourly workers have easy access to and understanding of their benefits, which boosts job satisfaction and retention. By streamlining the management of benefits like health insurance and retirement plans, HR systems help reduce errors and save time, allowing HR teams to focus on supporting their employees effectively. Employee self-service Many HRMS also offer employee self-service features. This refers to the ability of employees to access their own records and update their information. Why it matters: Employee self-service is a vital feature because it empowers employees to manage their own schedules, access pay stubs, and update personal information without needing to go through HR, saving time for both the employees and the HR team. This increased autonomy leads to greater job satisfaction and reduces administrative burdens, allowing HR to focus on more strategic tasks. HMRS security Security is a major concern for any business that stores data. This becomes even more salient when it involves personal data of employees like social security numbers and addresses. A data breach would not only raise all kinds of compliance issues but can genuinely harm your employees. That's why it's so important to consider the following security concerns when you prepare to implement an HRMS. Data encryption: One way to protect your data is to encrypt it. That means that even if someone were to gain access to your systems, they would not be able to read the data without the encryption key. Data backups: Another way to protect your data is to have multiple backups in different locations. That way, if one backup is compromised, you still have others to fall back on. Restrict access: It's important to restrict access to your HRMS to only those who absolutely need it. That way, if someone does gain unauthorized access, they will not be able to do as much damage. Two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of security that requires someone to not only know a password but also have physical access to a device like a cell phone to log in. This makes it much harder for someone to gain unauthorized access to your systems. Update regularly: It's important to keep your HRMS up to date with the latest security patches. That way, you can be sure you're as protected as possible from the latest threats. Strong password policies: Finally, it's important to have strong password policies in place. That means requiring employees to use passwords that are long, complex, and unique. How to ensure success when implementing a new HRMS Ready to adopt an HRMS? Here is a checklist of best practices to follow to ensure success when implementing a new HRMS: Define your goals The first step is to define your goals. What do you hope to achieve by implementing a new HRMS? Do you want to improve employee productivity? Save time and money? Attract and retain the best employees? Do your research The next step is to do your research. There are a lot of different HRMS on the market, so it's important to find one that will meet your needs. Be sure to read reviews and compare features before making your final decision. Consider your scope HRMS are not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's important to consider the scope of your project and find a system that will meet your specific needs. Some human resource management systems are broad and comprehensive and will essentially take over a function of your business. But on the other hand, you can find systems that are more limited and focused on one particular area. Get buy-in from stakeholders Another important step is to get buy-in from stakeholders. That means getting the support of upper management and ensuring they understand the benefits of an HRMS. Create a plan Once you have buy-in from stakeholders, it's time to create a plan. This should include a timeline, budget, and a list of key milestones. Train your employees Once you've selected a system, it's important to train your employees on how to use it. A good HRMS will have training materials available, but you may also want to consider hiring a consultant to help with this process. Implement gradually You don't have to go live with your new HRMS all at once. In fact, it might be better to start with a small group of employees and then expand gradually. This will give you time to work out any kinks and make sure that everyone is properly trained. Monitor and adjust Finally, it's important to monitor your new HRMS and adjust as necessary. Pay attention to how employees are using the system and whether they're finding it helpful. If you see any problems, don't hesitate to make changes. The right technology makes a world of difference HRMS are a necessary upgrade for any business that wants to improve its human resources management. By automating HR processes, these systems can save time and money while also improving employee productivity.

There are now many schools and courses that explicitly teach strategy human capital resource management. That is why it is vital to have managers that are adept at it. What Is Human Capital Management Strategy A human capital management strategy is an approach to human resources that streamlines the entire human resources process as one giant strategy. This strategy includes everything from recruitment to exit interviews and turns it into one process governed by a coherent goal. Companies that have coherent human capital management strategies will find it easier to achieve HR goals. Some of the HR goals that a coherent human capital management system could help achieve include workforce optimization, cost cutting, productivity maximization, and enhancing employee work life. Since this strategy introduces a different level of efficiency to human resources, it will no doubt make employees even more efficient. There will be fewer redundancies in administration, and employees will have a better experience dealing with HR processes. Concerns will be attended to on time, and it will be easier for workers to get their work done. This will, in turn, lead to reduced administrative costs as the system will be even more resilient. The achievement of all these separate goals, of course, will make it easier for the company to achieve its broader goals. How To Develop a Coherent Human Capital Management Strategy Through Four Strategies The four strategies to develop a proper human capital management strategy is to assess current HR capacity, forecast HR requirements, develop talent strategies, and lastly review, evaluate, and communicate the strategy. Assess current HR capacity The first step to developing a successful human capital management strategy is understanding the complex needs of the company, which is assessing current HR capacity. To do this, administrators must gather information from internal and external sources. Forecast HR requirements The next step is forecasting human resources requirements. Your main job at this step is to ensure the information gathered answers the key questions about capital management, which includes what capital is needed, what that capital needs, and how those needs can be met sustainably. Develop talent strategies Once those questions are answered, the next step is to set up parameters around how the company can implement these solutions. This process involves establishing roles, and responsibilities, and gathering info on the cost of setting the system up. It also involves setting baseline measures of success that will be used to evaluate the progress of the system. Review, communicate, and evaluate the strategy After a strategy is developed and fleshed out, it should be communicated throughout the organization. Since the system deals with humans, it may need to be regularly revised to deal with peculiar issues. That revised strategy should also be communicated throughout the organization. Why You Should Develop a Coherent Human Capital Management Strategy A good human capital management strategy isn't just a good thing for a human resource team to have — it is the good thing for a human resource team to have. It's almost impossible to successfully manage human capital otherwise, that's why a lot of teams think of it as an indelible asset to any company. Improves Visibility In business knowledge is power, and you can never have too much knowledge. The process of coming up with and implementing a human capital management strategy will give companies more visibility into their business processes. They will understand what policies have failed, which ones have been successful, and which ones need to be revamped. It will also show whatever gaps exist in human capital needs and human capital recruitment. This will, in the long term, lead to even more efficient recruitment. It will also lead to more efficient and coherent management. Optimize Business While these strategies, if implemented properly, will lead to growth in employee satisfaction, that's not where it ends. A good strategy will also have wide-ranging effects on the business as well. In general, it will lead to better company culture, more togetherness among employees, and better organizational performance. For companies looking for an extra organizational boost, there's probably no better answer than coming up with a solid human capital management strategy and implementing it properly. Speed Up Processes Speed is the key to efficiency, and a company that solves problems and performs tasks faster will generally get more things done. By implementing a human capital strategy, companies can move faster in accomplishing tasks than ever before. Having a faster recruitment and onboarding process, for example, will make new hires feel in tuned with the vision and mission of the company. In addition, having a self-service platform for hires will help them resolve issues faster, and will decrease the lag time between noticing a problem and solving it. Coherence The main thing that a strategic human capital management strategy provides is coherence. The strategy brings together different points of the HR process— like payroll and recruitment— and puts everything in one huge decision-making flow. Of course, one can still carry out these processes without a strategy, but it eventually breaks down at higher points of complexity. For example, new hires may have to provide their bio-data information again at the point of onboarding, when it has already been collected at the point of hiring. That's simply inefficient. Having a strategy means that these errors that lead to a disjointed system don't happen. This will benefit the entire organization both in the short term and in the long term. It Makes the Organization Standout Organizations are always looking to recruit talented and dedicated talent. One way to attract those talents is by providing a seamless and efficient human resource process. By implementing a proper human capital management strategy, you're making your business stand out. The core of your business is managing people, and how well you do that is going to be the difference between attracting top-tier talent and awful talent.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 03/30/22 How to create a great candidate experience Share this article Today, candidate experience is more than a buzzword. It has become one of the quintessential elements to attract top talent. After all, candidate experience is about how potential candidates feel about an organization after going through an interview process. Whether it’s a negative or positive experience, the first impressions directly influence candidates’ decision to accept or reject a job offer. Here’s the thing; over 80% of employees believe that negative interview experience changes their perception of the company or role. With bad candidate experience, employers end up losing the respect of their potential employees and impact their brand. On the other hand, around 90% of potential candidates concur that a positive onboarding experience helps them see the role or the company in a positive light. In fact, a good candidate experience propels potential employees to spread the word about a company or the role. Understand the Nature of Candidate Experience At its core, candidate experience boils down to shared interactions between recruiters and job applicants during the onboarding process. Every form of communication or proactive action from the start of the hiring process until the end determines the candidate's experience. Whether it’s reading about the job description, undertaking a formal interview, negotiating salary, or getting the job offer, they’re all part of the candidate's experience. Focus on the Key Components of Candidate Experience If you want to render a fulfilling and positive candidate experience, focus on the essential components of candidate experience throughout the hiring process: Job Search Start with the job search and find out how candidates are discovering and communicating with your company. Similarly, ensure the job application requirements are clear to potential applicants. Screening Process Create powerful and practical touchpoints across the screening process to create a positive candidate experience. Job Interview Ensure candidates are aware of the job responsibilities and skills to undertake various tasks. Whether it’s an in-person or virtual interview, design it to assist the candidate and cut out repetitive elements. Onboarding At the end of the onboarding process, make sure new hires feel welcome and special. Deliver on the promised values and structure a hiring process to engage with new employees for the next30 to 90 days. Best Ways to Improve Candidate Experience Once you’re aware of the main elements of candidate experience, you’re on the right track. But it’s not enough to get familiar with vital components of candidate experience. If you want to render a positive candidate experience, implement the best onboarding practices. Use ATS and CRM Solutions Use an applicant tracking system to streamline and automate your recruitment efforts. It is arguably the best way to improve the overall recruiting experience. Use CRM solutions to automate candidate interactions throughout the hiring process. You can also integrate CRM and ATS solutions to build passive and active talent pools. Use the Best Interview Tools Personalize and scale up experience recruitment efforts that can bring more value to candidates. You can use high-valued interview tools to create more flexibility for applicants and save time. Opt for AI-powered tools to review and determine whether or not a candidate is a good fit for the company. Digitalize Your Onboarding Process Adapt the new and practical onboarding strategies to garner the attention of top talent. For instance, you can digitalize your entire onboarding process to create more convenience for applicants. Final Thoughts The dynamics around the employee-employer relationship continue to change dramatically. When it comes to recruiting efforts, broadminded companies that prioritize talent and empower their workforce have the best shot to render the best candidate experience. Besides, disruption is bound to occur in a highly saturated and competitive job marketplace. And this makes it all the more important for companies to render the best candidate experience throughout the onboarding process. Remember, it takes one element that ruins a candidate's experience. But poor candidate experience revolves around many factors throughout the onboarding process. In the end, a poor candidate experience tarnishes the company's image and leads to miscommunication. As the job marketplace gets more competitive, job seekers continue to gain more power. And ensuring an effective candidate experience is all about making your recruitment process seamless for a diverse range of applicants. Modern-day recruiters understand that it takes a progressive approach and a mindset shift to change the onboarding process that works in favor of top talent. FAQ: Candidate Experience Here are the answers to some of the most asked questions about candidate experience: What constitutes candidate experience? Candidate experience refers to the collective experience of a potential employee with an interested company. Candidate experience is part of the multi-layered hiring process. And when applicants apply for a specific job, they go through an onboarding process that determines their positive or negative perception of the role and the company. Think of the candidate experience as a framework that HR professionals use to establish whether or not an applicant would be suitable for a specific job. What qualifies as a solid candidate experience? Successful hiring and recruiting efforts result in a positive candidate experience. Recruiters create touchpoints across various hiring process stages to determine and improve the candidate experience. What makes candidate experience valuable? The first impression of talent about a role and the organization impacts their decision to be part of the company. If the hiring tunnel is straightforward, potential candidates are bound to form a positive experience. Oftentimes, job seekers are discouraged and demoralized when a company fails to inform them about their application status. Online reviews often creep into a negative candidate experience. In hindsight, the candidate experience can impact employer branding and employee retention. Candidate experience also ties together with the company’s revenue stream and profitability. How do you provide candidate experience? For starters, it is imperative for recruiters to communicate with top talent about their onboarding process and paint a clear picture of their organizational culture. Similarly, HR professionals can provide candidates with suitable resources to help them prepare for job interviews. If a potential applicant lands the job, it is crucial to make the new employee feel welcome. On the other hand, if a potential employee does not get the job, make sure to provide feedback. In the virtual hiring process, make sure new hires have everything they need to set up and initiate remote operations.
