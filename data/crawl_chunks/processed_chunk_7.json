In fact, recent statistics show that on a global scale, 3 in 4 employers report difficulty finding the talent they need. Experts say the talent shortage is now at a 16-year high. The reasons behind our nation’s ongoing challenge to both attract and retain employees vary. From the need to find great fulfillment or purpose in work to a desire for freedom beyond the daily grind, today’s workforce is considering its options more closely. And they’re no longer afraid to make dramatic changes. A survey by management consulting firm Korn Ferry revealed that almost a third (31%) of people would quit their current job even without another one lined up. Sourcing new applicants in a job market forever redefined by the onset of the Great Resignation and COVID-19 requires much more than posting an open position on a job board and waiting for applicants to pour in. It involves leveraging new strategies, and old strategies in new ways, to get your open position in front of more prospective candidates in your community. Active vs passive sourcing of candidates It's an applicant's market. Those looking for employment have a plethora of open roles to choose from, and with employers offering competitive wages and benefits to entice applicants in, job seekers are always on the lookout for the best offer. What does that mean? Not only do you need to craft an enticing job description that highlights the unique benefits of working for your business, but you also need to make sure as many people see it as possible. There are two strategies for sourcing applicants: passive and active. Passive sourcing means you post a job listing and wait for prospective employees to apply. There was a time when this low-lift approach was all it took to fill your applicant pool and staff your business. But in today's job market, posting a job listing without actively promoting it is akin to chopping down a tree in a forest—did anyone even see it? Businesses today must take a more active approach to sourcing applicants to ensure their job listing gets in front of as many eyes as possible. There are several ways to do this, but one of the most common and most effective is the tried and true 'now hiring' sign. With applicant tracking systems (ATS ), automation, and text technology transforming the hiring space, the 'now hiring' sign has evolved to be versatile and effective method for capturing applicants. The modern 'now hiring' sign QR codes and text-to-apply codes have transformed the 'now hiring' sign into a digital sourcing tool, despite often being a promotional poster in a business location. When used in conjunction with an ATS, these codes allow applicants to see your promotional material and begin their application on the spot from their phones. Their application is then automatically routed to your ATS, where you can begin the screening process. It's that easy. When you stop to consider that many of your potential job candidates are first attracted to your company as customers, it makes sense to post promotional materials at key locations throughout your business and its online presence. Think of the different ways people interact with your company on a daily basis. And then use those same interactions for possible recruitment opportunities. Add a QR or text-to-apply code to the bottom of the receipts Include small flyers in to-go or delivery orders Feature posters on countertops in guest rooms Place ads on screen before the movie trailers Adapt your approach to the nuances of your particular business or industry. Play on your customers’ genuine interest in your company while also giving them a closer look into all the reasons why it’s such a great place to work. Take your recruitment strategy into your community Placing your 'now hiring' signs and QR or text-to-apply codes throughout your business's physical location is a great way to attract applicants from your customer base, but don't stop there. Your future employees will likely live in your community, so promote your open job listings  in other places where friends and neighbors gather: Post your posters to community boards at coffee shops, apartment buildings, gyms, gas stations, and more Place promotional materials on the job boards at your local college, university, or technical/trade schools Pass out fliers at local sporting events, farmers’ markets, concerts, arts festivals, or other community events Sponsor community events to ensure attendees see your job listing Ask your current employees to share your posters, business cards, flyers, and QR codes with their friends and family. When (and if) you can, motivate them with referral bonuses and other incentives for helping out with your efforts. Boost your online presence to reach more applicants Studies indicate up to 58% of consumers follow brands through social media. Similarly, 59% of employees cite a company’s social media presence as a big reason why they chose it as their workplace. But it’s not just about awareness. Social media is a great way for businesses to host job listings, reach out to prospects, get people to refer candidates via posts, and research applicants. Some tactics you can employ to use social media as a recruiting tool include: Post to Facebook groups for your community or related interests Post ads on Craigslist or other similar online classified ad sites Share on the Nextdoor app, or other community-based apps Build up the online presence of your business on social media channels like TikTok , Instagram , and Twitter to source candidates and attract applicants . Find tips for increasing your social media sophistication and know-how here . Once you’ve got your recruitment strategy in place, bring it all together with an ATS like Workstream to help streamline the entire process—from posting initial job vacancies and creating custom text-to-apply posters to completing new-hire paperwork.

It allows you to improve various aspects of your business and align your team to your next moves. Unfortunately, hourly workers are often overlooked when it comes to company culture. As a result, most of them feel disconnected from their employers and underappreciated for their hard work. So, how do you build a strong culture among hourly workers to ensure that they feel a sense of belonging as much as your salaried employees do? Start by identifying who they are and what’s important to them. Many of them are probably parents or students and have a lot of obligations outside of work. Some may have another part- or full-time job to make ends meet. Look at things from their perspective and implement practices that meet their very real needs. Here are several strategies you should consider adopting: 1. Giving Them Autonomy to Schedule Their Shifts One of the best ways to do this is by giving your employees the power to schedule their shifts. This shows that you trust them and their abilities (and that you don't consider them to be just hourly workers who must do as they’re told) and gives them the flexibility to balance their hectic schedules. By doing this, you’re also likely to gain happier employees who are more efficient and content with their jobs. (And, bonus, you’ll have one less obligation on your plate.) 2. Communicate Frequently Because of the nature of hourly worker shifts, not all employees will be present when you make announcements or discuss important issues. So, you need to make sure that you’re communicating with them whenever there is something important to be said. Keep them in the loop to the best of your abilities. Do your best to gather the entire team before making an announcement or when sharing important information. When that’s not possible, consider asynchronous communication like text messaging or email. At Workstream, we offer automated SMS services that allow you to send training videos to your new hires and existing employees. Automated reminders are also provided to ensure the completion of the tasks. 3. Provide Predictability One of the biggest downsides of being an hourly worker is unpredictability. Apart from their shifts changing constantly, their wages are also inconsistent. Sometimes they will work the same hours and get paid differently, just because some days were slower. These issues are especially difficult for hourly workers at bars and restaurants, where tips make up a large portion of their pay. The nature of their role is simply unpredictable, and no employer can promise to change this. However, you can make an effort to provide at least some level of predictability whenever possible. Add some structure to your scheduling process so that everyone gets an equal opportunity to sign up for busy and slow days. 4. Offer Career Development Opportunities Hourly workers shouldn’t be excluded from career development. Most workers say that a lack of opportunity for career progression has resulted in them leaving their job . They choose to take or keep jobs that offer them an opportunity to learn something new and improve their skills. Talk to your hourly employees and learn more about their ambitions, interests and career goals. Consider investing in their training and give them the chance to prove themselves. If the circumstances fit, they may even become full-time employees in different positions. Doing this promotes a culture of trust and a rightful rewarding system where hard work and investment pay off. 5. Collect Feedback The backbone of your company culture is your employees. With numerous ways available to come up with an optimal culture, many leaders forget about the simplest strategy: asking for feedback. There is nothing wrong with simply asking your employees about how you can improve your approach. By showing them that you genuinely care and are interested in their opinions, you’ll be able to increase transparency. It will also emphasize the importance of honesty and openness in your company culture. Meet with your employees on a semi-regular basis and talk about their ongoing issues and how you can help them make their experience in your company better. Prioritizing your company culture—especially being mindful of your hourly workers—will set you apart from other companies. Hourly employees want to know that they’re part of a company that sees their needs and values their contributions. While implementing one, or all five, of these strategies will help your employees feel a sense of belonging, they are not “one and done” approaches. Regularly take inventory of who your employees are and adjust your company’s attitudes and behaviors to meet their evolving needs. Interested in knowing more about the latest trends in the industry?

It's like we're standing on a beach watching as the tide of traditional recruitment recedes. In its place, waves of innovation crash onto shore with automated hiring . This isn't just another tech trend either. Imagine an orchestra conductor, coordinating every instrument to create beautiful music. Now picture automated hiring doing that for your HR department. We're not talking about cold-hearted robots making decisions. Instead, think more along the lines of Sherlock Holmes paired with Iron Man's Jarvis - intelligent assistance saving time and effort while maintaining a human touch.

Why automate the hiring process ? What is automated job posting? Is modern hire an ATS? Conclusion Understanding the Significance of Automated Hiring The importance of automated hiring in today's recruitment landscape is undeniable. The rapid evolution of AI technology , which is expected to grow at a rate of 38.1% from 2023 to 2030, has played an instrumental role in this shift. Incorporating automation into hiring decisions not only streamlines manual tasks but also enhances the candidate experience throughout the process. It’s like turning a switch that illuminates your path forward - you can see clearly and move faster. It almost ensures that your interview process leads to the best candidates . Automated recruiting software allows HR teams and hiring managers to focus on strategic initiatives by automating repetitive administrative tasks such as job posting, screening resumes , scheduling interviews, and sending out offer letters. Recruiters can spend their time more productively by avoiding the drudgery of mundane paperwork, instead engaging with applicants to form meaningful connections. This doesn’t mean human touch gets sidelined; it just finds its place where it matters most – building relationships and creating meaningful interactions with potential hires. Hiring processes become more efficient due to reduced time spent on manual tasks involved in sifting through piles of applications or coordinating interview schedules manually. With fewer barriers standing between qualified candidates and their future jobs, employers stand better chances at securing top talent before competitors do so. This way automated hiring not only saves time but significantly impacts long-term success too. The Role of Automation in Recruitment Process Recruitment automation has revolutionized the hiring process . Let's take job posting for instance - a task that was once time-consuming and manual is now streamlined with the help of automated recruiting systems. Streamlining Job Posting with Automation A job post, when done manually, can be tedious to create and share across multiple platforms. But automation shines here by making it easy to distribute your open positions across various job boards and social media channels. This saves significant time for HR departments, allowing them to focus more on relationship management with candidates instead of mundane tasks. Furthermore, an increased reach leads to a larger talent pool which makes finding qualified candidates easier. Enhancing Onboarding Experience through Automation The advantages don't stop at just hiring; they extend into onboarding too. Automated processes not only save time but also improve new hire experiences dramatically. A seamless onboarding experience ensures long-term success within your company as per this Gallup study . It suggests that companies using recruitment technology for effective employee integration saw their turnover reduced by 25%. An applicant tracking system (ATS) coupled with AI could further enhance these results by providing personalized journeys based on candidate profiles thereby improving overall employer brand perception. Improving Candidate Experience with Automation Tools Imagine walking into a party where you know no one, but the host makes sure to introduce you around. That's what automation tools can do for your candidates in the hiring process . Leveraging CRM Systems for Better Candidate Engagement Candidate relationship management ( CRM ) systems are like that friendly host at the party. They give personalized touchpoints, enhancing communication and engagement during recruitment. An automated University of Chicago study on bias in recruiting processes shows how this can also reduce and eliminate bias by treating every candidate equally. No favorites here. With these systems, each step is tracked and automated from initial contact through offer letter delivery. This ensures transparency which helps build trust with job seekers . Making Application Process Smooth as Silk No more tedious manual tasks involved. The application process becomes streamlined when automation takes over. It saves time both for recruiters and applicants while reducing human error – everyone wins. The result? Candidates have an improved experience because they get swift responses without delay due to automatic interview scheduling or instant feedback after personality tests. In essence, improving candidate experience isn't just about making them feel good - it's strategic too. When candidates feel valued throughout their journey, they're more likely to accept job offers when they come knocking. Ain’t that something? Optimizing Screening and Selection through Automation The recruitment process has always been a blend of science and art. But now, with the rise of automation tools, it's becoming more scientific. Especially when it comes to screening and selection procedures. We're not just talking about reducing unconscious bias here – though that’s definitely a huge plus. We’re also discussing how these automated systems help recruiters focus on high-value tasks like building employer brand or interacting with candidates. A New Era for Recruiters Recruiting automation benefits recruiters in multiple ways - but let's be honest, who doesn't want some extra time saved? Instead of going through heaps of resumes manually, you can now use an intelligent system that does all the heavy lifting for you. This gives HR teams room to breathe and allows them to shift their focus towards tasks which require human touch such as candidate interaction or branding strategies. Reducing Unconscious Bias No matter how unbiased we try to be during hiring processes , there will always be some degree of unconscious bias involved towards potential candidates . But what if I told you that automating your recruiting process could help minimize this? A study from University of Chicago showed that using automated systems significantly reduces bias in recruitment processes . So yes, technology is helping us make better decisions after all. Focusing on High-Value Tasks The beauty behind automation lies not only in its efficiency but also its ability to free up time spent on tedious manual tasks . With machines handling repetitive work like sorting out applications based on qualifications or scheduling interviews automatically; recruiters can now concentrate more effectively where they are needed the most. So let's start embracing this new era of recruitment where we optimize our processes and get the best talent onboard. Key Takeaway: Automated hiring is a game-changer, bringing science into the art of recruitment. It saves time by screening and selecting candidates efficiently, allowing recruiters to focus on high-value tasks like branding or candidate interaction. Plus, it helps reduce unconscious bias for fairer hiring practices. Embrace this new era and attract top talent with ease. Harnessing the Power of Recruitment Technology As we step into a world increasingly driven by data, recruitment software solutions have become vital tools in talent acquisition . They help streamline the hiring process and make sure that no potential star gets lost in the crowd. The heart of these systems is often an Applicant Tracking System (ATS). This tool organizes candidate information, keeps track of communication, and even helps with scheduling interviews. It's like having your own personal assistant dedicated to managing all things recruitment. Key Features of Automated Recruitment Systems The power behind automated recruitment systems lies in their multifaceted capabilities. They are not just digital filing cabinets; they can be powerful allies for HR departments when it comes to making important decisions. Data-driven decision-making becomes easier than ever before with detailed analytics offered by these platforms. Whether you're looking at time-to-hire metrics or comparing sources for top candidates, having this data readily available lets recruiters strategize more effectively. Studies show using automation has led to improved employee turnover rates by 25% on average. However, technology doesn't mean losing touch with our human side. These tools simply free up more time for what really matters - building relationships with candidates and fostering a positive company culture. Maximizing Efficiency in Job Posting and Candidate Sourcing Delving into how automation enhances job posting strategies and sourcing techniques to attract a wider talent pool and improve talent acquisition . Leveraging Automation for Wide Reach In today's digital world, an automated approach lets you cast a wider net across various job boards and social media platforms. This way, open positions get more visibility amongst job seekers - giving recruiters access to a larger talent pool . This isn't just about quantity though. Automated hiring also helps attract more qualified candidates by allowing for targeted postings that appeal specifically to your ideal applicant profile. Improving Talent Acquisition with Automation Tools Achieving cost efficiency is key in recruitment. Automating tasks involved in posting jobs can lead to significant time savings for HR departments - time better spent on high-value tasks like building employer brand or relationship management with potential hires. An effective strategy includes using data collection tools alongside AI-powered recruiting software that offer insights into how well your posts are performing among target audiences – ensuring continuous improvement of your recruitment processes . \"Automated hiring: Where machine learning meets human touch.\" The Future Outlook of Automated Hiring As we peek into the future of automated hiring, AI and machine learning stand out as game-changers. But it's not all about robots taking over - a balanced approach with human involvement remains crucial. The Role of AI in Future Recruitment Artificial intelligence is set to revolutionize recruitment processes by making them more efficient and less biased. With intelligent algorithms at play, HR departments can reduce unconscious bias, allowing for a fairer decision-making process. This could make things much simpler for those in HR, and also improve the whole experience of applying for a job. In addition to streamlining tasks involved in posting jobs or scheduling interviews, advanced systems will offer automated features like background checks and personality tests that were once tedious manual chores. This translates into significant time savings without compromising on quality. Balancing Automation and Human Involvement No matter how sophisticated machines get, they can't replace the 'human touch' completely - there are aspects such as employer brand perception or candidate relationship management where humans shine brighter than any AI ever could. This doesn't mean resisting automation ; instead it’s about leveraging technology to take care of repetitive tasks while letting humans focus on areas where they add most value – nurturing relationships with potential hires or shaping company culture, for instance. To summarize: The future outlook isn’t about choosing between man vs machine; rather it's finding harmony between both to build an efficient recruiting team armed with powerful tools that give them more time for what matters most – people.

But one that has always risen above all is employee referrals. For the past few years, referral programs have been the top choice for recruiters to source for candidates. According to a study, 82% of employers chose referrals as the source that produces the best return on investment as compared to other recruiting channels. An employee referral program is essentially a recruiting strategy where existing employees introduce qualified friends or family members (or anyone they know, really) for jobs in their company. Typically, these employees will be rewarded should their referral be hired into the organization successfully. With both parties gaining something out of it, referral programs are a good way to motivate current workers to help the company bring in quality hires. So why exactly does this program bring out more successful hires? And how can it help your QSR in the current pandemic climate? Read on as we break down the benefits it brings to you as a hiring manager and how you can incorporate it in your hiring process! Why Referrals Work Better Than Other Sources Better cultural fit Since those who are referred to the company already know someone working in the organization, it is likely that they are also familiar with the culture of said company. Thus, chances are, they would only proceed with the hiring process if they are attracted to the company culture in the first place. It has been proven that if you hire an individual with the right cultural fit, they tend to have higher satisfaction levels and are more likely to stay longer in the company . Our point is - hiring through referral programs will create a cumulative effect of benefits to your company. It not only ensures that you hire quality candidates but also reduces your turnover as you retain them in the long run. Better promotion of company What better way to promote a company than through your employees? Company reviews by current or former employees are deemed so important by job seekers that 1 in 3 people have rejected their job offers due to bad reviews of the company found online. Through the use of referral programs, you are letting your employees promote your company through their very own experience. After all, who will refer their friends or family members to a company they dislike working in, right? As those who are referred know their referee personally, they are likely to trust them and be more inclined to apply for a job in your organization. This is especially useful in the current pandemic climate where many are not ready to work just yet. Due to the stimulus checks given by the government, most job seekers are delaying their job search . Hence, the prospect of being hired at a trusted company may just propel them to start working again. Larger candidate pool As restaurants are reopening and resuming their dine-in services, this means that many employers are starting to look for hourly workers to support their operations. With this increased competition, you have to make sure that you stand out among the rest. And with a referral program, you can do just that. Think about it - would you rather apply for a job at a company that your friend recommended to you or a random one you found on a job portal. Most would choose the former since the probability of you having a good working experience there is higher as you already have a connection there. Thus, adopting a referral program will help you cast a wider net for quality candidates in a highly competitive market. Workstream’s Referral Program At Workstream, we understand how useful a referral program is for hiring managers.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 07/11/22 Intro to social media for QSRs Share this article Today’s hourly workforce lives online. They share their lives, connect with their communities, and most importantly, search for information on social media. In fact, 79% of job seekers use social media during their job search, and 92% of companies are already using social media for hiring. Quick-service restaurants have been slower to jump on the social media train. But with hiring a top challenge for restaurants nationwide, there’s never been a better time to start building up your social media presence and attracting employees to your business. 4 steps to creating and maintaining a social media presence that attracts applicants 1. Start with one social media page Social media is overwhelming, but everyone starts somewhere. If your QSR doesn’t have a social media page yet, create one . You don’t have to be on every single platform on day one. Pick a platform you think your target audience is on, and master it. TikTok is the trending social media platform, which has now surpassed Instagram in popularity among Gen Z users (born between 1997 and 2012) in the United States. Users are also majority female, coming close to 61% for TikTok users in the U.S. On the other hand, Twitter is the most popular among Millenials , where men between 25-34 years of age make up the largest age demographic, followed by men between 35-49. 44% of U.S. adults aged 18-24 use Twitter. 2. Master the platform you’re starting with The best way to know what gets attention on any social media platform is to get on it yourself and see what catches your eye. Create a personal account if you don’t have one already and start playing around. For example, you’ll notice that TikTok is filled with short-form video content and trendy music. Posts are short with attention-grabbing visuals and captions. Instagram allows single-photo posts (rather than purely video content) and provides more flexibility for lengthy captions, which is great for storytelling and explanations. We’ve curated tips for recruiting on Twitter , TikTok , and Instagram to give you a headstart on the best strategies and features on each platform. 3. Create content Now that you know the types of posts that are successful on the platform you’ve selected, it’s time to start creating your own. Throwing up the equivalent of a “now hiring” sign is not going to get people to stop scrolling and pay attention to you. Here are some tips: 1. Keep it simple: Use imagery with striking colors, photos, and designs that are consistent with your branding. Keep the words short on the image itself. 2. Use platform-specific features: Many platforms have their own unique features. From Instagram Stories and Reels to Twitter Spaces and YouTube Shorts, these features help your content go out to non-followers’ explore pages, getting you in front of a larger audience. 3. Engage with the community: Post polls and Q&As to get your audience interacting with you. Remember to reply back as well so they feel like they’re talking to a person, not a corporation. 4. Always include captions: Captions should be concise and include brand-relevant hashtags. The tone of the caption should also be in line with your brand personality. 5. Add a call-to-action: Social media shouldn’t be a dead end. It should push people to keep engaging with your brand. Remember to always link the post back to your website or hiring page. 6. Sponsor posts: Building a following organically takes time and patience. If you’d like to jump ahead, sponsored posts and paid ads are a way to pay to put your post in front of people outside your current follower base, increasing the chances you gain new followers. 4. Determine a posting schedule if you’re starting from zero, your main goal is to build followers. Posting every day (or almost every day) gives you more opportunities for people to see your content. And while that frequency might sound time-consuming, it doesn’t have to be. There are many tools online that let you schedule posts in advance. Set aside some time once a week to schedule your content and it won’t feel like a daily burden. Keep in mind that posting frequently in the early days is a good strategy as long as the content is good. If your posts are repetitive or boring, you could lose followers. Social media will become second nature in no time After a while, creating compelling content, scheduling posts, engaging with your community, and sticking to a posting schedule will get easier and take you less time. Once you’ve successfully maintained your social media channel for six months, you can even start building up a second channel to attract more customers and prospective employees to your business.

Among those competing for everyone’s 2+ hours of likes, views, and follows are restaurants. And it’s an effective strategy for gaining a competitive edge. Another study shows that 45% of U.S. diners tried a restaurant for the first time because of a social media post by the establishment. 36% of them follow restaurants on social media. And 42% interact with restaurants on at least one social media platform. Attracting customers is just one consideration factor. Rather than relying on “help wanted” signs or job postings, savvy restaurateurs also actively recruit their job candidates through social media. By creating a unique online presence, you expose people to your brand and its work culture. Why people follow restaurants on social media People follow restaurants on social media to gain an insider’s perspective. To discover upcoming menu items and learn more about their favorite mixologists and chefs. Or for the inclusive feel that comes with being part of a community. But they don’t follow restaurants to be bombarded by non-stop advertisements or strictly promotional content. People want to be involved in the conversation. The ways in which you engage with your audience depend a lot on the social media platform(s) you use and the audience your quick-service restaurant (QSR) wants to reach. Let’s get more familiar with the top social media apps around. Popular types of social media content today Today’s fastest growing and most popular social media app is TikTok . It’s even prompted Instagram and Snapchat to respond by creating copycat video features of their own (Reels and Spotlight respectively.) For the younger Gen Z audience, it’s also changing how people use the internet to find restaurants. Many Gen Zers now turn to TikTok for online searches rather than Google. Instagram is the second-most popular social media platform with 33.3 million users (compared to TikTok’s 37.3 million) with those born between 1997 and 2012. When it comes to Twitter , Millennials remain the most active user base on the platform with men between 25-34 years of age its largest demographic. Facebook and YouTube continue to be the most widely used online platforms for all U.S. adults: 69% still use Facebook and 73% use the video-sharing site. Whichever audience you seek to attract, the most important thing you can do is create a social media account for your restaurant. Choose the one platform that best fits your target audience and master it by regularly building content. Tips for easily building social media content 1. Get your best employees involved If your QSR has some great employees, more than likely they’re connected with some pretty cool people outside of work, too—both online and in real life. Especially your Gen Z staff. As the first generation of digital natives, more than 65% of them use social media each day and care about their online presence. Their involvement in your efforts doesn’t need to be complicated. Employees already active on social media are likely willing ambassadors of your QSR. With a little support and encouragement, their participation comes naturally. Ask your employees to post short-form videos, images, hashtags, and other content about your QSR on their social media channels. When a new position becomes available, ask them to reach out and give referrals to their followers. 2. Create a personal brand presence As you start to establish your QSR’s online presence with social media, don’t forget to build up your personal brand as well. What are the things that make your business resonate with customers? What differentiates it from the rest? Creating content through the lens of a personal brand will give you focus and provide customers (and followers) something more to relate with. For example, you could emphasize the craftsmanship and sophistication of your restaurant with behind-the-scenes short-form video content of how your food is made. Your staff is already doing the work, making it easy to capture. You could become the QSR known for its people. Sharing their perspectives and stories with attention-grabbing visuals or captions via single-photo posts. Or be known for your integrity by responding to customers’ online reviews. 3. Post content on a regular basis Getting into a rhythm with promoting restaurants and attracting candidates on social media takes time. But it quickly becomes second nature the more often you post. Here are tips for keeping an engaging social media presence going: Stick to the basics: Whether online, in-store or on the mobile app, the look and feel of your brand (and its voice) should be consistent for your customers on every platform. Highlight your employees: Profiling the people who make your business unique is an effective way to humanize your online presence and help customers feel connected. Bring them into your story: Don’t just tell people your QSR is a great place to work, show them. Post a video to let your audience see what it’s like to be part of your team. Engage with your audience: Host livestream events, Q&A sessions, and interactive polls to create a buzz. Build anticipation and give people a reason to keep coming back. Above all, post frequently with quality content. Daily or weekly, it’s up to you. There are tools available that let you schedule posts in advance. If someone on your staff is especially tech-minded or interested in crafting social media, it might even make sense to assign them responsibility over your accounts. The time to build an online presence is now In the past, many QSR owners and operators were slow to get on the social media bandwagon and put their message out to their audience. But if you’re passionate about this industry, you can no longer afford to be on the sidelines. Remember, success on social media looks different for everyone. But you’re no stranger to hard work, commitment, or innovation. The more you understand and leverage the technology, the more you’ll begin to attract more employees, get (and retain) more customers, and build more brand equity for your business.

What exactly is Twitter and what can you do with it? Twitter is a social media platform unique because of its 280-character limit on social posts, also fondly known as \"tweets.\" The microblogging platform allows users to send and receive tweets, follow other users, and even share information by \"retweeting.\" Because of it's designed to be fast-paced in nature, Twitter is also a popular platform for keeping in touch with worldwide trends, news, and entertainment-related content. So, why consider recruiting on Twitter? Did you know that 58% of job seekers use Twitter in their job search ? 78% are also looking at organizations’ Twitter accounts for job opportunities, making Twitter a place with a large and active candidate pool. Additionally, 59% of users regularly get news from Twitter (specifically 17% of Americans), with an advertising audience of 353 million . The largest age segment of Twitter users ranges from 25 -34 years at 28.9%; this is closely followed by 35-49-year-olds at 28.2%, effectively making it the best platform for you to hire Millennials and Gen X . Recruiting on Twitter 101 Getting started Like any other social media platform, the first step is creating an account. Select a username relevant to your brand. It should ideally contain your brand name while being memorable and distinct. You may even consider having multiple handles: one primarily for consumer-facing branding, while the other could be focused on recruiting. Theoretically, it would make sense to create an account for branding before branching out into recruiting, but you may also choose to dive right into the recruiting account. Having multiple accounts helps segment your audience and prevents dilution in content. Once you decide on your handle, it's time to set up your profile photo (this should definitely contain your logo), a header, and also a short biography. These should be consistent with your branding on all other social media platforms to maintain a unified brand identity. Generating content Twitter is known for its short word limit of 280 characters, so all content should be concise and to the point. Think about how to best bring your point across with as few words as possible while still capturing the attention of your target audience. Pictures and videos are a great medium for recruiting on Twitter. Remember, the captions should be a fair middle ground between casual and formal. When using Twitter for recruitment specifically, consider introducing your brand or company culture in the first tweet. This will be helpful in setting the context and getting the audience hooked before going into available job postings. Remember to keep a balance between employee branding and job openings, as these go hand in hand. Engaging with your audience It's important not to just post about yourself on social media and call it a day. You need to engage your audience and create a community on your platform for it to gain traction. Consider sharing articles you find interesting, \"retweeting\" key thought leaders in your industry, and communicating with your followers and other brands. This gives you the opportunity to reach followers of other brands you've interacted with as well, expanding the potential reach of your Twitter recruitment efforts. Wendy's has a great reputation for doing just that. Their Twitter account is known for 'roasting' other quick-service restaurants (QSRs). They rolled out a #NationalRoastDay tweet which encouraged brands to reply for a savage comment in return. Replying to people interacting with your account or tagging your brand in their own tweets will also help increase the visibility of your account. You can also note the people actively interacting with your brand on Twitter as a potential pool of applicants when hiring. Job ads Finally, the whole reason you were on Twitter in the first place - start posting job advertisements! These could be in the form of \"tweets\" containing links to job openings, or boosted (paid) ads that could appear in the feed of targeted users. Remember to include a job title, a link to the job opening, and utilize hashtags to optimize these ads. How to hire effectively with Twitter After nailing the basics, you may then choose to incorporate some of these tips on how you can hire effectively on Twitter. Maximize the Features From hashtags to videos and even polls, these are just some of the many features Twitter has which you can maximize to increase the engagement and reach of your job posts. Get followers to actively retweet or like your posts, or even explore the use of trending Twitter hashtags (by looking at Twitter's trending hashtags list). Spotify uses the hashtag #JoinTheBand on job-related posts, which makes it easy for applicants to look for new roles and job opportunities. Have an announcement for an upcoming career fair or event? Pair it with videos or GIFs to reiterate the point! Incorporating media content is also usually effective in increasing the likelihood of retweets and likes, which in turn brings up the post to more users. Video content will also be more effective in capturing attention, as opposed to a wall of text. Building your Brand A focus on employer branding reinforces your organization's culture, which could excite and interest potential candidates. From tweeting about perks given to employees, how your organization is contributing to the community, or even sharing behind-the-scenes footage of team bonding sessions, these are all fun ways to boost employer branding via your Twitter account. Shake Shack encourages more potential applicants to sign up for job openings by listing incentives in their job posts, such as a $500 hiring bonus. Getting employees to share about their experience is another way to add a personal touch to job posts, and educate potential applicants about what they're signing up for. Chick-fil-A reposts videos and photos of their employees at work, to showcase their vibrant work culture. Not only does this showcase heartwarming footage, it is also a great opportunity to acknowledge the hard work and effort put in by their employees, especially when it comes to service. Employer branding isn't limited to your organization's Twitter account too! Encourage all employees to tweet using a specific hashtag to share about what's going on in the organization, be it bonding activities, newcomer packs or celebrations. Twitter employees often tweet about team bonding activities or welfare packs with #LoveWhereYouWork, highlighting its efforts in creating a fun work culture. Cultivating these habits may also help in trending the hashtag on Twitter, thereby increasing visibility and awareness. Finding Potential Candidates Discover potential job seekers by searching for people that mention your company in conversations. Look out for individuals with interesting profiles, who may be a good match for your company. You could also utilize ' advanced search ' to find the perfect prospects. Consider following them, making conversations while replying to their tweets or reach out to them via Direct Message to find out more about them. These allow you to gain insights into potential new hires and recruit candidates who are genuinely interested in your organization. Track Effectiveness There are several key performance indicators (KPIs) to determine the success of your campaign. These can help you to decide if managing a recruitment Twitter account is worthwhile. Likes, retweets, and impressions are the general benchmarks, but an additional tool could be tracking or bit.ly links, which will be effective in providing conversion numbers. By tracking how many people actually click into your job posting, or applied for the job, you'd be able to figure out how many additional job applicants each post is getting you. Consider running the Twitter account for a couple of months, which will give a good sense of how effective the posts are, relative to the number of applicants. Summing Up There is great potential for recruiting on Twitter, especially as more job seekers are utilizing it as a platform to source for new opportunities. Take the time to understand the concept behind Twitter, how it works and the audience it attracts, and you will be able to reap the benefits from it as an effective hiring tool.

These aren't necessarily the best places to get in front of qualified candidates . Most young people aren't reading newspapers, flyers have a very limited reach, and if a candidate is browsing online job boards , they're likely applying to dozens of jobs—who knows if they're actually interested. That's why we recommend using social media for example Facebook, LinkedIn , Instagram to let the users know about your job openings . You can target people who have expressed interest in your brand and, best of all, there are many free options. There are 1.59 billion daily active users on Facebook. So how do we use this high audience volume to fit your hiring needs? There are several methods: Facebook community groups, company pages, Facebook job postings . Photo credits: https://www.emarketer.com/content/the-social-series-who-s-using-facebook 1. Facebook Groups Facebook Groups are one of the best ways to hire hourly workers. I t helps people with similar interests find each other and build a community. Information circulated in these groups is targeted and relevant to each community, making it a great place for your Facebook job postings. Unlike Facebook Pages, Facebook Groups require a different approach to fully utilize their functions. Before advertising your job vacancy, you’ll need to know the crowd that you’re looking for. In the hourly workers' space, you should probably look into local employment groups—avoid ones that are global or overcrowded. You wouldn’t want your employees to be located five hours away from your business or to have your Facebook job posting get pushed down within a few minutes of posting. How to go about finding the right Facebook Groups to join There are so many Facebook Groups out there. So how do you narrow down which ones would be best to join to find employees to hire? Facebook’s advanced algorithm makes it easy for you to find exactly what you're looking for. In the search bar, use keywords that are specific to your business. If your business is located in San Francisco, opt for keywords that highlight the location like “hourly jobs in San Francisco.” If you're looking to hire specific job roles like bartenders , use keywords like “ bartender jobs,” and combine it with the location of your business to make it more targeted: “ bartender jobs in San Francisco.” Chances are there are many other groups out there. You can get creative with your keywords like “employee,” “jobs,” “hiring,” “hire,” “work,” “workers” etc. 2. Facebook Business Page To find employees to hire and build your brand, you can start by creating a Facebook Page . Facebook users who follow their favorite businesses on Facebook have a greater chance of responding to its Facebook job listing since they've already displayed loyalty to that brand. To start, proceed to this Facebook link and follow the guided steps: Select “Business or Brand” Select a Page Name and Page Category. Your page name should be your business name to build brand association; your page category would be the industry in which your business lies. Add the required information Add a profile picture . This is typically your company’s logo for easy brand association Add a cover photo. It’s encouraged to be creative here! If you're hiring hourly workers, you could put up creative job search banners as your cover photo. Fill out additional information such as your page description in the settings bar on the top right-hand corner of your Facebook Page After creating a page, it's time to start posting some content . It can be in the form of news feed , videos or pictures to showcase your business or even short descriptions that give audiences a clear understanding of what your business does. When you start to gain a following on your page, you can start creating Facebook job listings . 3. Post high-quality content to showcase your company culture Producing high-quality content is key to advertising job openings on Facebook. Each content piece you post on your page should help your audience on their news feed to paint a picture of your business. If you’re running a restaurant, you can post high-quality pictures and videos of the food you serve, and share new menus or promotions. Include engaging text with these images and videos to appeal to your audience. Video is a preferred medium when planning out your posts . Numerous studies have shown that videos are far more engaging than content with only pictures or text. Make use of these variations of content types to appeal to your audience. With strong content, your business can appear professional and more appealing to your audiences. Moreover, it helps you build your brand image and showcase the nature of your business to potential applicants. These content pieces will help you attract more followers to your page and increase your business’s visibility during the hiring season. 4. Maintain and promote your Facebook Page Running ads on an empty and unorganized Facebook page will not bring the results you want to achieve. It takes time to build and maintain your page before you start running your job listings . The key to maintaining your page is to update it regularly, be creative, and active on messenger as well. The top priority is having a content calendar set up. A content calendar is one where you plan for the content that you would like to publish on your page on selected dates with a fixed frequency. Frequency of posts One of the most common questions businesses ask is how many times should I be posting on Facebook ? You wouldn’t want to be posting too much and end up spamming your audience, but you also don't want to miss the opportunity to engage your audience by posting too little. It's recommended to post once per day to avoid having your posts perceived as spam. Sharing regular updates with optimized job titles on social media platforms helps keep your audience and potential employees up to date with your business. If you're running a Facebook page with followers from your target demographic , you can start posting job ads on on varied pricing bids. With Facebook’s schedule function , you can schedule all your social media posts without worrying about being on standby to post daily. Answering machine and interaction Staying responsive on your Facebook page helps you communicate with your prospective job applicants as quickly as possible. Responsive pages and Facebook accounts either in comments section or via messenger also get awarded with a responsive badge by Facebook. In the settings section of your page, there is a drop-down with a “messaging” option. You can set up automated responses under “response assistant” to engage the audiences who open a chat window when you're not online. You can customize this to any greeting or advertisement of your choice. Attracting followers There are numerous ways you can attract followers other than simply pushing ads out. You will need to understand who your targeted demographic audience and potential candidates are to tailor each piece of content to appeal to them. Having more followers ultimately mean a larger pool of potential employees too. 5. Utilizing Facebook Ads When you are done with the basics of creating and maintaining your Facebook page , it is time to look towards promotional strategies like ad campaigns with clear CTAs like “ apply now ”. A good ad campaign not only brings customers to your business, but also helps you attract potential new employees . Understand Facebook ad promotion At the top bar of your Facebook page , you’ll find an “ad center” tab  where you can create and maintain your ads. You can start off by selecting the “promote” function on the top left corner of your company’s Facebook page . Here, you can select the type of promotion that you would like to run. The best way to use Facebook ads to find employees to hire is to run ads that generate leads. Creating a lead generation ad A lead generation ad helps you collect information from your targeted audience with a form. You can set up ads from drop-down-menu that promote the job role that you are hiring for and use the form to collect details of interested applicants and reach out to them. The few main things to include in your form would be Name Email Contact number (Optional) Some short answer qualifying questions Select a photo that depicts the kind of job (tip: add clear and concise job description on the image and caption as well) that you are trying to hire for or select a fun photo of your company to showcase your team culture. Include creative copy to capture the attention of your target audience . Now that your ad is done, you need to think about who you would like to target with your ad. Since your goal here would be to hire hourly workers, your target audience from the drop-down-menu for your ad could go towards millennials or students who are seeking for a job while studying. With all the data that you have, you can post these ads onto the Facebook groups that were covered in the earlier part of this guide. This helps you get your ad out to a targeted demographic who are also active job seekers . 6. Ad Bidding For your ad to reach your targeted demographic effectively, ad bidding is essential - you will be competing with your competitors to reach out to your target audience and interest them in what you have to offer. Facebook has a standard automated ad bidding setting for your campaigns but it does not necessarily reap the best results. In order to launch your ad’s full potential, you will have to do custom aid bidding. Advertiser bid Advertiser bid is the amount of money you are willing to invest in your ad. Bidding too low can bring in results but the outreach volume will be compromised. On the other hand, bidding too much can mean throwing money freely. Ad quality and relevance impact Facebook recruitment Ad quality is very much similar to your overall page quality. Facebook will determine the value of your ad through the means of testing - if your ad receives negative feedback, the value of it decreases; if your ad receives positive responses, the value of your ad increases, and so does the chances of your target demographics . Similarly, ad relevance is tested in the same way - if your targeted demographic responds poorly to your ad, the ad relevance is low and if your targeted demographics responds well, your ad relevance increases. Estimated action To estimate the action rates of your advertisement, Facebook gets feedback from your targeted audience based on how likely they are to click on your ad combined with their past behavior.

Ruling out applicants with criminal records only makes the search more difficult—especially after you realize how many people fall into that category. Recent studies suggest as many as one in three Americans have some type of criminal record. Overlooking the criminal justice-affected workforce doesn’t just limit the size of your applicant pool. It means missing out on an underappreciated group of hardworking people—a population that’s eager to find the right opportunity to prove themselves and get their lives back on track. When given a second chance, they’re not the only ones who benefit— 82% of managers think that employees with criminal records perform as well or better than workers with clean records. The benefits of hiring people with criminal backgrounds Some employers might feel hesitant or concerned about hiring someone with a criminal record. They worry about the safety and well-being of their existing employees and customers, ways it could affect their company’s reputation, or the possibility of a crime committed in the workplace. However, many businesses now routinely hire and actively seek out ex-cons for their workforce. Starbucks, Amazon, Hilton Hotels, Walgreens, Delta Airlines, Dunkin Donuts, and even Google are all known to be felon-friendly employers. This should help demonstrate that hiring ex-cons can offer your organization more advantages than liability issues. Some of these perks include: Participating in the Work Opportunity Tax Credit ( WOTC ) program . This is a federal tax credit incentive program available to employers who hire certain target groups of job seekers like ex-cons. This one-time tax credit for each new hire can be up to $9,600. Enjoying a lower-than-average employee turnover rate . Workers who have a criminal record are often very appreciative of the people who gave them a second chance when no one else would. Which is why their annual turnover rate is 12.2% lower than average. Gaining access to more job applicants in a tight market . With low unemployment rates and labor shortages in the US, hiring ex-cons gives you options. Like an applicant pool that includes the 600,000+ people released from federal or state prison each year. Keep in mind, people with criminal records had lives before incarceration: prior job experience, formal skills training, and college degrees, all things that can prove valuable to your business if you’re open to giving someone a second chance. But there are challenges to be aware of first. Barriers to hiring people from the criminal justice system Across the US, there are approximately 20,000 statutes and regulations that restrict the hiring of ex-cons. For example, several states won’t grant professional licenses to people with a criminal past. Plus, routine background checks often rule out otherwise qualified non-violent offenders. Case in point: According to the Second Chance Business Coalition , when a criminal record is revealed during a background check, the likelihood of a second interview is reduced by 50%. A stat that weighs more heavily when you realize 90% of employers require a background check. Fortunately, companies are working with policymakers to reverse these barriers with efforts such as ban-the-box rules to stop employers from asking candidates about their criminal history on job applications. There are also things you can do to help get past these barriers, too. What you can do to overcome hiring barriers at your business More than likely, your existing hiring policies weren’t created around the needs of people with a criminal past. However, by making a few adjustments, any business can show that it’s ready, willing, and prepared to consider former felons for its current job openings. If you do have a background policy, be as clear as possible about what you’re looking for. Is it only for felony convictions? Misdemeanor charges? Will you look for dismissed or acquitted charges? Without details, people with criminal backgrounds won’t apply. Reconsider your lookback period for your background check. For example, is it really necessary to look back more than seven years? Five years? Without any incidents for a few years, a nonviolent offender’s past should become less relevant to job consideration. Think about the places where you currently source your talent. Whether it’s a post on a job board, on your company’s website, or on its social media channels, let applicants know that people are fairly assessed and given a chance at employment—even with a record. Reach out to community organizations, civic leaders, and your local government for guidance in recruiting individuals with criminal backgrounds. Or partner with Honest Jobs , one of the nation’s leading job marketplaces for people affected by the criminal justice system, to post job openings. You can also tap into the power of Workstream’s text and automation technology to fairly source and screen applicants, schedule your interviews, and onboard deskless employees with ease.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/27/21 Text recruiting is the future of recruitment Share this article As an increasing number of Millennials and Gen Zs enter the workforce, behavioral patterns are changing vastly, with rising demands for digitization, convenience, and efficiency. With over 4 billion active users a month and a 90% open rate for text messages , which are often read in the first three minutes , messaging becomes an increasingly popular part of the recruiting process . Text recruiting is a very topical method that can help broaden the talent pool and enhance the candidate experience . Not only will texting candidates help with the rising generations but text recruiting software will make the lives of hiring professionals exponentially easier. What is text recruiting ? Text recruiting is a modern and efficient approach to talent acquisition that leverages the power of SMS (Short Message Service) and instant messaging platforms to engage with potential candidates . It involves using text messages to communicate with job seekers , share job openings, schedule interviews , and even conduct initial screening processes. Text recruiting provides a quick and direct means of connecting with candidates, making it a valuable tool for recruiters and employers seeking to streamline their recruitment efforts and engage with candidates in a more personal and immediate way. Respecting a candidate’s time and schedule Show your candidates that you value their time. Instead of assuming that they’re available, texting for recruiting acts as a ‘heads up’ and gives them time to make preparations. There is a high chance that these candidates are already in a day job, with busy schedules or environments that do not allow for them to pick up their phone (especially from an unknown caller). Dropping a text prior to the call allows them to move to a quieter place, or revert on their availability. Efficiency Messaging speeds up the entire communication (and eventually hiring) process, as most people are almost always on their phones, and are more likely to check their messaging apps than their email inboxes. Text recruitment via SMS text messages has 18 times the response rate of emails , with a much greater chance of the applicant responding to your message. Sending out a text message takes only a couple of seconds, and can be used as a follow-up to prompt candidates to take a look at their inbox. Not only is it a quick method to connect with your candidates, it will also allow them to contact you instantly when the need arises. To set the context, texting a candidate prior to the interview allows them to follow up with a call to you (the job recruiter) should there be technical difficulties, or if the interviewer does not show up on time. Allows for optimal candidate performance As the hiring process is often stressful for candidates, choosing to send a message instead of springing a surprise call can also help them get in the right headspace. They will then be able to perform to their best abilities during the interview, since they will be more composed and prepared for the interview, rather than being caught off guard. It will also provide them with sufficient time to refresh their memory about the role, especially if they applied for multiple roles or applied for your role a while ago. Ability to customize contact lists From sending personalized messages to individuals or group broadcasts to multiple candidates, text messaging grants flexibility to the job recruiter. This saves you time from sending messages individually, but instead blast messages based on credentials or pre-set lists based on the stage of the recruitment process the candidates are at. Elevating A Candidate’s Recruitment Experience To create a seamless recruitment experience for a candidate, it is crucial to understand what they want. Still not convinced that text messaging is the way to go? Let’s take a look through the lens of a candidate. We have compiled a list of statistics highlighting the preferences of candidates, based on surveys and studies conducted by various institutes. Candidates are open to texting for recruiting Candidates are open to being contacted via text messages during the recruitment experience. 66% of job seekers feel that it is acceptable for recruiters to contact them via text, while 73% say they want to receive targeted job offers via text. Preference for mobile text notifications A 2019 research study showed that candidates who received mobile text notifications rated their recruiting experience 50% higher than those without. This implies that in the eyes of the candidates, text messaging does improve the hiring process and improves their experience. Texts over phone calls A study by OpenMarket highlights 75% of millennials stating a preference for recruiting text messages over phone calls . iCIMS ’ class of 2021 report also shows that 89% of Gen Z college seniors are comfortable with texting potential employers during the hiring process . How to Utilize Text Messaging in Recruitment Arranging for a call By texting your candidate to arrange for a call, they will be able to identify your phone number (rather than rejecting the call from an unknown caller ID) and provide their availability. You will save time as a hiring manager since candidates are more likely to pick up your call afterward or call back if they’ve missed your call, rather than ignore the call completely. From the candidates' perspective, it also saves them from awkward situations, such as picking up your call while they’re in their current workplace. Following up Have an urgent interview to schedule, but the potential candidate hasn’t replied to your email? Follow up with a simple text message , by reminding them to take a look at their inbox at their convenience. Following up with text messages will help encourage prompt email replies, and allow you to obtain missing information more efficiently. Providing Reminders Text messages can act as reminders for candidates, such as interview schedules, documentation, or even advice or encouragement. This saves both parties the hassle in the event that a candidate forgets about their interview and doesn’t show up. Text-to-Apply Posters Text recruiting is more than just texting back and forth with applicants. Text features can be incorporated not only on the recruiter’s end but also for the candidate. Consider the use of text-to-apply posters , where custom posters with QR codes are printed and displayed at locations (such as your QSR). When customers scan the QR code or text the number displayed, they will gain access to all open positions and this can become an awesome tool in a hiring managers recruiting strategy . A consolidation of open positions makes it easy for them to explore roles they’re interested in, and texting for recruiting will also make it more convenient for candidates to apply. Automation Automate text messaging by utilizing features such as Workstream’s automated scheduling , where hiring managers can select applicants they’d like to move to the next stage. These applicants will instantly get a text message link to the hiring manager’s Workstream - Google Calendar to schedule a zoom. Reminders are later sent to reduce ghosting. This will give hiring managers more time to focus on more important tasks such as hr strategy and final hiring decisions that help create greater value for the organization. Mobile Training Text recruiting also allows the human resource team to easily send handbooks, checklists, and training videos through a text message link . This makes training materials easily accessible for all employees, and this information can be sent to both new and existing hires, with SMS reminders to guarantee completion. Best Practices for Texting for Recruiting Ensure that the candidate has given their permission Unsolicited texts may seem invasive - which may cause unintentional conflict or lower their chances of responding. In application forms, include a section for candidates to indicate their preferred means of communication, be it via email or text messaging . Do not use your personal phone If possible, get a company phone to manage text recruiting . With job postings attracting many applicants, it will be too much to manage on your personal phone, which will be constantly buzzing. Company phones also ensure that you do not give out your personal contact number to candidates - doing so will increase the chances of being contacted even after office hours, making it difficult to separate work from your personal life. Identify yourself When you reach out to a candidate, be sure to include your name and the company you’re recruiting for, together with the title of the role. This allows applicants to figure out who you are, instead of simply deleting the text thinking it’s a spam message. Stay professional Do ensure that you maintain a formal to semi-formal tone when reaching out to candidates via text messages . This is dependent on the branding of your company, and while it is possible to maintain a friendly tone, it is still essential to convey professionalism. Abbreviations and shorthands should be avoided, especially in the first few text messages . Pay attention to timing Take note that you should contact them within business hours , and never text outside of these hours except when it is initiated by the candidate. If you’re working with candidates across various time zones, you should also be aware of the timings to prevent instances of texting them when it’s 1 am in the morning at their location. Templates One easy best practice is to create text recruiting templates . These templates serve as a valuable tool for simplifying the recruitment process , allowing recruiters to quickly and consistently reach out to potential hires. They often include standard introductory messages, interview scheduling requests, follow-up inquiries, and more. By utilizing text recruiting templates , recruiters can save time, maintain professionalism, and maintain a consistent and engaging candidate experience . These templates can be tailored to specific roles, industries, or stages in the hiring process , making them a versatile resource for modern recruitment efforts. Reply promptly When you text a candidate, you expect them to reply as quickly as possible. The same goes for when a candidate reaches out to you. Ensure that you’re on track with replying to messages and do not leave them hanging for a long time. After all, text recruiting is supposed to be efficient and should help in speeding up the job- hiring process . Talent acquisition is hard so lets try and make it significantly easier! As you can’t be expected to reply to messages 24/7, automatic replies within the text recruiting platform you use will also serve as a good substitute for when you’re unavailable. These include out-of-office texts, and when they can expect you to get back to them. Summing Up Now that you’ve understood the importance of text recruiting and how it can elevate a candidate’s experience , incorporate it as a new feature in your next recruitment campaign. Be sure to keep in mind the best practices, and you’ll be one step closer to an optimized and more efficient recruitment process .

Schedule a call with us for personalized insights and recommendations to take your QSR to the next level! FAQs How do you recruit through text? Recruiting through text involves several key steps. First, recruiters compile a list of potential candidates and obtain their consent to receive text messages related to job opportunities. Once candidates opt in, recruiters can send them job alerts, details about open positions, and even conduct preliminary screenings through text-based interviews. It's essential to keep messages concise and engaging to maintain candidates' interest. Recruiters can also use texting platforms that integrate with applicant tracking systems (ATS) to manage and track candidate interactions effectively. How much does text recruiting cost? The cost of text recruiting can vary depending on the platform or service you choose to use. Some text recruiting solutions offer pay-as-you-go pricing models, while others may charge a monthly subscription fee. Additionally, costs may increase with the volume of texts sent and the number of candidates you need to reach. It's essential to consider your budget, the size of your recruitment needs, and the features offered by different text recruiting providers when determining the cost that aligns with your recruitment strategy . Is it okay to text recruiters ? Yes, it is generally acceptable to text recruiters , especially when they have obtained your consent to do so. Many recruiters and employers have adopted text messaging as a communication channel to reach candidates more efficiently. However, it's essential to be mindful of the timing and content of your messages. Opting in to receive texts from recruiters is typically a positive step if you are actively seeking job opportunities. It's also a good practice to respond promptly and professionally to any texts from recruiters, as it demonstrates your interest and engagement in the recruitment process .

Whether it’s appointment scheduling , project management , trimming down those pesky notifications real-time , or anything else under the sun. Like a circus performer spinning plates on sticks, with each plate representing an employee's shift. One wrong move and everything comes crashing down. Business owners across the globe face this challenge every day. But what if I told you there's a way to escape this chaos? Imagine swapping those precarious plates for an automated system that spins itself perfectly in sync - no more crashes! A world where artificial intelligence takes over tedious scheduling duties while complying with legal requirements.

What are the benefits of automated scheduling ? What is a good program for scheduling? What is the app for auto scheduling employees? Conclusion Understanding Automated Scheduling The era of manually creating employee schedules is fast becoming a thing of the past. Automated scheduling , powered by artificial intelligence , has become an integral part of modern workforce management. It's not just about assigning shifts; it's also about making sure that labor demand aligns with available resources. The concept and benefits of automated scheduling If you've ever asked questions like \"What is automated scheduling ?\" or wondered how this technology can benefit your business, let's break it down. At its core, automated scheduling uses advanced algorithms to generate optimal work schedules for employees based on various factors such as their availability, skills, and legal compliance requirements. This system doesn't just schedule work but goes further to help reduce human error while ensuring seamless operation in your organization. With automation taking care of repetitive tasks like shift planning and overtime tracking, businesses are now able to focus more on strategic activities rather than administrative chores. Role of AI in revolutionizing employee scheduling In today’s dynamic workplaces where changes occur frequently - whether due to sudden spikes in labor demand, reschedules , no-shows , or time-off requests from team members - having a flexible yet robust solution becomes critical. Here’s where Artificial Intelligence (AI) steps into the picture. A smart automatic scheduler leverages AI capabilities not only for optimizing staff rosters but also ensures fairness when distributing shifts among workers – thereby increasing job satisfaction levels considerably. Moreover, studies have shown a significant boost in workplace efficiency, payroll management ease, and team organization on the fly thanks to automated scheduling . When we consider these benefits - increased efficiency, flexibility, legal compliance, employee satisfaction – it’s no surprise that automated scheduling is quickly becoming a must-have tool for businesses worldwide. After all, who wouldn't want to get more done in less time ? Key Takeaway: Automated scheduling , backed by AI, is revolutionizing workforce management. It's not just about shift allocation but ensuring optimal labor distribution while boosting efficiency and job satisfaction. This powerful tool reduces manual errors, aids in legal compliance and frees up time for strategic activities - a true game-changer. Key Features of Top Automated Scheduling Software When it comes to choosing the right automated scheduling software , there are two crucial features that set the top tools apart: user-defined parameters and time tracking capabilities. User-defined Parameters and Compliance with Legal Requirements The ability to define custom rules is a game-changer in automatic schedulers . These parameters can help ensure your business complies with legal requirements such as minimum rest between shifts or maximum work hours per week. You wouldn't want any scheduling conflicts leading to overtime spending, would you? With an automatic scheduler , those worries can be put aside. Saving time while maintaining legal compliance might seem like magic but remember this isn’t Hogwarts. It's all about having smart technology at your fingertips that helps streamline the process by managing employee schedules efficiently. This way, small businesses can focus more on growing their venture instead of getting tangled up in administrative tasks. Time Tracking and Managing Employee Availability A good automated scheduler doesn't just schedule employees; it tracks their time too. Think about it - how handy would it be if you could handle everything from labor demand assessment to team member availability within a single tool? This is where advanced features like handling time-off requests come into play. For instance, when Joe asks for Saturday off because his band got its first gig (Go Joe.), an effective auto-scheduler takes care of adjusting the shift schedule without causing any hiccups. Now that’s what we call striking a chord. In essence, finding the optimal schedule becomes much easier when using these robust tools—saving precious hours every busy day—and let's not forget the drastic reduction in human error . So, whether you're a thriving startup or an established enterprise juggling multiple locations, these key features of top automated scheduling software can help your business run like a well-oiled machine. Now that’s music to our ears. The Power of Automated Scheduling in Business Efficiency Automated scheduling can be a real boon for businesses. It streamlines the scheduling process , drastically reduces overtime spending, and skyrockets employee satisfaction. Let's look closer at this. How automated scheduling saves time and reduces costs To start with, an automatic scheduler takes over the task of juggling multiple variables like labor demand, legal compliance requirements, and employee availability. No more wrestling with spreadsheets or spending hours on end manually assigning shifts. This smart tool also factors in demand signals to predict peak times accurately - making sure you're never understaffed during rush hour or overstaffed during slow periods. An added bonus? This tech-savvy approach to shift planning helps avoid costly human error that can lead to issues such as accidental double-booking or violating predictive scheduling laws. Saving Time With Automatic Shift Schedule Creation Let's talk about how much time you save when using an automated scheduler . Picture this: instead of fiddling around trying to accommodate everyone’s preferences (and inevitable last-minute changes), your software does it all for you at a single click. It considers user-defined parameters while keeping track of individual work schedules – no small feat considering it needs to balance team member availability against business demands seamlessly. Reducing Costs through Smart Staff Allocation We've talked about saving time; now let's look at cost reduction—another massive win with automated scheduling . By aligning staff allocation with labor demand, businesses can drastically reduce overtime spending. Plus, being compliant with legal requirements like predictive scheduling laws helps avoid hefty fines and penalties. Moreover, an automatic scheduler can help to avoid wasting money from being overstaffed or having a lack of staff which could lead to lower service quality and customer satisfaction. Boosting Employee Satisfaction Wrapping things up, let's not forget how automated scheduling can seriously boost employee satisfaction. Key Takeaway: Automated scheduling is a powerhouse tool for businesses. It streamlines workforce management, slashing overtime costs and skyrocketing employee happiness. No more manual shift juggling; this smart system takes care of it all, helping you avoid costly errors and fines while ensuring optimal staffing levels at all times. Implementing Automated Scheduling Businesses are increasingly realizing the benefits of automated scheduling . The idea is to let an automatic scheduler manage your workforce, eliminating human error and saving time. Creating optimal schedules with a single click The real magic begins when you can create perfect employee schedules in just one click. This is possible because most automatic shift schedule systems, such as Deputy, use artificial intelligence (AI) to consider various factors like labor demand, legal compliance requirements, and individual employee availability before churning out a near-perfect work schedule . This type of AI-driven process not only helps streamline the scheduling work but also aids small businesses in managing their resources more efficiently by matching team members ' skills and preferences with shifts that suit them best. Plus, it drastically reduces overtime spending - something every business owner would appreciate. In essence, implementing an automatic scheduler takes off loads from managers who previously spent hours wrestling with spreadsheets or paper-based rosters during a busy day at work. It's one of the easiest ways to optimize operational efficiency while ensuring legal compliance - especially for businesses operating across multiple locations where local predictive scheduling laws may differ significantly. An effective auto-scheduler makes sure no team member is overworked or underutilized by evenly distributing workload according to user-defined parameters which include employees’ preferred working hours or specific job roles they excel in. The end result? A happier workforce. Employees choose when they want to work and even request time-off directly through the app – fostering better relationships between staff and management alike due to its transparency aspect alone. Choosing the Right Automated Scheduling Software for Your Business If you've been juggling employee schedules manually, then it's time to embrace automated scheduling . Before you jump into it, make sure to weigh these points in order to find a scheduling tool that works for your business. Factors to Consider When Selecting a Scheduling Tool User interface and usability are vital considerations when choosing an automatic scheduling software . You need something easy-to-use but powerful enough to handle all of your team members ' availability nuances. Your chosen tool should also integrate seamlessly with other platforms used within your company. This will let your labor demand signals guide schedule creation without manual intervention, drastically reducing human error and saving precious time. A cost-effective solution is equally important for small businesses looking at their bottom line. And while free apps might seem attractive initially, they may not offer comprehensive features like handling legal compliance or predictive scheduling laws necessary for certain industries. FAQs in Relation to Automated Scheduling What is automated scheduling ?

You have also most likely been experiencing an increasing behavioral trend in your job applicants and employees called “ghosting.” Ghosting is a term originally coined in the dating industry for a dating partner that went “dark.” After the first date or even a couple of months of dating, one of the partners goes silent. Despite the other partner calling and texting, the ghost partner is totally silent, not returning any calls or texts. This same concept is now growing rapidly in the human resources world, especially in the QSR industry. Job applicants and even current employees have started exhibiting ghosting behavior at an alarming rate. Ghosting has become so pervasive in the labor market that it was even highlighted in the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book . Ghosting in the QSR Industry There are countless examples of ghosting in the QSR industry. Job applicants accepting jobs and then not showing up for their first shift at the restaurant and never being heard from again. New shift managers walking off the job in the first month and never being heard from again. Even more prevalent are job applicants accepting interviews and then not showing up for them. According to Indeed , 28% of job seekers ghosted an employer in 2020, up from only 18% in 2019. It is clear that ghosting is on the rise. Ghosting is a major problem. It costs hiring managers valuable time that they could have spent operating their restaurants and providing better service to their customers. Ghosting also costs restaurants considerable amounts of money over time as they spend initial dollars on costs such as screening, training, and uniforms, only to have the new employee stop showing up and stop returning calls. Is It Possible to Reduce Ghosting at Your Restaurant? In the current climate of an already tight labor market that makes good employees hard to find and keep, ghosting is pouring salt on the wounds of exhausted and frustrated QSR owners and managers. The good news is that there are steps you can take to greatly reduce ghosting by your job applicants and employees. Let’s take a closer look at four strategies. Strategy #1: Build a Smart Technology Infrastructure to Prevent Ghosting While you can greatly lower the ghosting rate, it’s unlikely that you’ll escape ghosting entirely. Using cutting-edge technology to reduce ghosting—saving time and money—is the secret. There are three key components to a smart anti-ghosting technology infrastructure: Component 1: Smart Screening Use advanced hiring technologies to automatically assess the quality of job applicants before you schedule a time to meet them. Examples of these technologies include having applicants upload a short video introducing themselves , or prompting applicants to answer several questions to determine if they meet your requirements. This smart screening technology is the first layer of defense that you can successfully implement to reduce ghosting because it prevents candidates who are more likely to ghost you from taking up time on your interview schedule. Component 2: Automated Interview Scheduling Hiring managers know first-hand how much time can be spent on doing multiple back and forth calls and texts just to get an interview scheduled. Instead of using this arcane method, adopt a technology platform that allows you to give permission-based calendar access to job applicants so they can schedule an interview with you during the times you’ve marked yourself available. This technology eliminates the back-and-forth communications and saves you valuable time that you can use to run the best operation possible. Component 3: SMS Text Confirmations In addition to wasting time trying to get interviews scheduled for ghost-likely applicants, hiring managers also waste considerable time waiting around for ghost applicants who never show up to their scheduled interviews. There is now a powerful technology solution available to QSRs in the form of SMS text confirmations. With SMS text confirmations, applicants automatically receive a text message from the hiring manager shortly before their interview asking them to reply to confirm their interview. If they do not reply, then the hiring manager knows not to now wait for them and can instead devote their energy to running the restaurant. Jamba recently reduced its ghosting rate by 90% by utilizing this SMS text auto-reminder capability. Strategy #2: Mention Non-Monetary Benefits at the Very Beginning of the Hiring Process In the current hotly contested labor market, it’s critical that you stand out from your competition when it comes to the hiring process. One of the best ways to set your restaurant apart from the competition is by mentioning your non-monetary benefits in the very first communication with a job applicant. By non-monetary we mean any benefit besides their hourly wage. This could be any special perk such as partially subsidized childcare, career coaching, hiring parties, or other fringe benefits. By giving applicants upfront visibility into what you can offer them, you’ll help motivate them to follow through with your process and not ghost you when it comes time to interview. Strategy #3: Make an Extremely Professional First Impression with a Personal Touch Another way to set yourself apart and reduce ghosting is to make an extremely professional first impression with an added personal touch. In order for your restaurant to make a highly professional first impression, you may need to give your hiring managers extra training. Not all hiring managers have the skills and training to communicate and behave professionally in the hiring process. The first impression that your restaurant makes to an applicant should engage them and make them feel respected and valued. Additionally, we recommend your hiring manager adds appropriate personal touches in their communications so that applicants aren’t left feeling like just another number. If your hiring managers can connect with applicants in a personalized yet professional way, it increases the chances that an applicant will not ghost your restaurant because there will be a greater sense of mutual empathy between applicant and hiring manager. Examples of personalization include being sure to use the applicant’s name frequently in communications and making specific positive comments on the experiences they have shared in their application about their past work. Strategy #4: Run a Highly-Organized Onboarding Process for New Hires According to the Society for Human Resource Management, up to 20% of turnover happens within the first 45 days of starting a new job. So, it’s critical that you run a highly organized and engaging onboarding process. You should have a clearly documented onboarding process that provides a cohesive experience for new hires. Avoid miscommunications and disconnects between multiple managers during the onboarding process. When managers are not on the same page, it’s a red flag to new hires and the chances of ghosting will likely increase as a result. During onboarding, you should also continue to make the new hire feel respected and appreciated. If possible, have a company event outside of work hours that brings the team together. Social activities like this help new hires meet and get to know existing employees. When employees feel part of the team through engaging and positive onboarding experiences, the chances of ghosting decrease. Don’t Let Ghosting Spook You, Instead Be Proactive Ghosting will inevitably happen to every restaurant from time to time. But with careful planning and implementation of infrastructures—technologically, organizationally, and interpersonally—you’ll have a strong foundation for reducing it. A great example of this is how Dunkin’ recently reduced its ghosting rate by 90% . Dunkin’ is not the only QSR having tremendous success reducing ghosting. There are many others who are adopting strategies that are helping them engage applicants and streamline hiring.

As you compete for qualified candidates, know that every potential hire is also making a choice between your company and all the other job opportunities they’re applying for. In fact, hourly workers typically apply to several jobs at once—often up to eight at a time. Which is why doing the bare minimum as a hiring manager no longer cuts it. Be passive, and you risk losing candidates to your competitors. The impression you (and your business) make during the hiring phase can even influence employee retention weeks or months in the future. So, how can you start things off right with applicants? To create a better applicant experience and improve the hiring effectiveness at your company, you need to know the three common mistakes most hiring managers make and how to avoid them. Mistake 1: Not putting pay and benefits in your job postings Like every hiring manager, you’ve got certain expectations in mind when it comes to your ideal employee. Whatever combination of skills, experience, attitude, or personality that is, you know what it takes to thrive at your business. Candidates have their own criteria they’re evaluating potential jobs against too. Pay and benefits are important factors for hourly workers when choosing a new job opportunity. When that information isn’t included in a job posting, it can deter serious applicants. In contrast, job postings that include pay and benefits can increase initial applicant interest and boost your visibility on sites like Indeed. On average, Workstream customers who post pay and benefits see 65% more applicants. In this economy, qualified candidates have more options than ever before. By immediately showing them why they should apply, you’re at an advantage. Highlighting pay in job descriptions is the first step. Check out our tips below. To effectively communicate how the benefits package you offer increases your total employee compensation, try the following four strategies: Prioritize benefits that supplement pay : For an employee, perks such as a free meal during a shift can be seen as a $10 or $15 daily benefit. Family discounts, the potential for bonuses, or tip shares are other benefits that add to an employee’s compensation. Call out growth opportunities : Among hourly employees considering leaving their jobs, 41% cited a lack of advancement opportunities as their reason. So, if a new hire at your company can become a shift lead within six months, mention it in your job posting. It shows you’re offering a long-term opportunity and are willing to reward people for it. Avoid vague benefits and terms . Phrases like “great atmosphere” and “lots of growth potential” are overused and lack meaning. Although many applicants want to work for a mission-driven company, that’s not as important as knowing you’ll be fairly compensated. Call out flexibility . We all have lives outside of work. An employer willing to be a little more flexible than others is a big deal. Besides attracting applicants, it encourages retention in the workplace. Give specific examples in your job descriptions, like how you can customize schedules to fit an employee’s needs or if an on-call calendar is available. By writing clear and accurate job descriptions, you set the standard for the quality of applicants your business attracts. It’s also a helpful way of letting your candidates know exactly what they’re getting themselves into while reducing the odds they’ll quit right away after being hired. Mistake 2: Not messaging applicants enough In most situations, timing is everything—the hiring process is no different. Especially when your business is actively competing for the best applicants in the area. Remember, when people are applying for your job, it’s almost a given that they’re exploring other job opportunities all at once. As the employer, this means timely and transparent communication with applicants is critical. Strive to engage with them as soon as possible. It’s important to show potential hires that you're proactive about filling job positions and finding out if they’re a good fit at your company. It’s why Workstream clients who manually message most of their applicants experience 67% fewer no-shows when compared to those employers who rarely or never message applicants. The benefits of a timely and transparent communication strategy are clear: You have a 2.4x greater chance of hiring when you proactively contact applicants first You have a 25% greater chance of hiring when you contact applicants within an hour of receiving their application Unfortunately, most hiring managers are unaware of their poor communication practices and the negative effects they might have on prospective employees. Like making the mistake of waiting too long to reach out after receiving an application. Not sending out reminders about upcoming interviews. Or accidentally repeating messages due to uncertainty over who's been contacted. Without frequent communication with your applicants, it’s natural for them to feel unimportant and overlooked. To demonstrate to everyone that they’re a priority to you and your business: Set a goal for how often to message applicants during the hiring process and stick to it Use a combination of automated and personalized messages throughout your strategy For efficiency and consistency, use automated messages for stages in the process, like when additional information is needed or an application was successfully received Use personalized messages at more critical stages in the process, like giving a job offer Great communication between employers and applicants is the basis of a successful recruiting strategy. Without it, your company risks losing potential hires and top talent to the competition. Mistake 3: Limited interview availability Most hiring managers agree interviewing people is a time-consuming part of the hiring process. But if you think finding time in your busy schedule to meet applicants is frustrating, look at things from their side. When you only schedule interviews at your convenience, it limits your availability at the expense of your candidates—without regard for their time or current work responsibilities. By automating the interview process, your business can spare your interviewers and applicants the time and frustration of manual scheduling (or playing phone tag) to coordinate a job interview. With an ATS system like Workstream in place, you easily set your own availability and allow applicants to schedule their own interviews. This will help you prioritize the dates and times of the week when you can interview—while also giving candidates the freedom to choose from those options without needing to contact you first. With Workstream, applicants can self-schedule and interview in as little as 60 seconds. They’re also 2.6x more likely to accept an offer when they can schedule their own interview immediately. And there’s a 16% greater chance of hiring applicants who interview the same week they apply. Streamlining the interview stage of your company’s hiring process is worth the effort. It helps you get the right candidates in the door before they accept an offer somewhere else. And a smooth and fast interview process leaves a good impression on your new hire, decreasing premature turnover. High turnover rates don’t only affect your recruitment strategy. Hiring less serious candidates can bring unneeded stress, decreased productivity, and lower morale to your workplace. Remember, since all these problems can be traced back to the interview, they’re also avoidable. Conclusion Hiring managers who leave pay or benefits off job postings, don’t message applicants enough, and don’t offer candidates the ability to schedule interviews quickly can diminish the overall applicant experience. With a more effective recruitment strategy, it gets easier to identify candidates who are the right fit for your business, enjoy the kind of work you do, and are more likely to stay for the long term. By prioritizing the applicant experience, you also ensure your company’s success in the future.

But more and more organizations are realizing that prioritizing employee recognition could be the key to retaining workers. Employers want to make committed employees happy to reduce turnover, avoid knowledge loss, and manage recruitment spending. Something as small as saying thank you can have a profound impact. So, how do you ensure you’re doing all you can to make your workers feel appreciated and recognized? Why recognition is important in 2023 Before we dive into some of the strategies your business can use to improve recognition, let's talk about why it's vital in the first place. Recognition connects workers to their jobs First, it's essential to realize how impactful a recognition strategy can be for companies. At Nectar, we recently surveyed 800 full-time employees to gather employee recognition statistics . The results from this survey highlighted the impact that recognition has on employees: 81.25% of employees feel valued by their employer 83.6% of employees feel that recognition affects their motivation to succeed at work 77.9% of employees would be more productive if recognized more frequently 81.9% of employees agree that praise for their contributions improves their engagement Retention reduces turnover Companies continue to deal with staffing issues. Many organizations are trying to find ways to reduce employee turnover , and they’re trying things like: Gathering and acting on employee feedback Offering the right benefits and wages Removing toxic managers and employees Working on building a stronger company culture Improving workforce engagement Thankfully, recognition helps you advance a lot of your retention goals. Do deskless employees feel valued in 2023? Our survey reached several industries, including sectors that typically employ deskless workers like retail , hospitality , manufacturing , and healthcare . Industry Number of respondents Feel valued by employer Would be more productive if recognized more Agree that recognition for their contributions improves engagement Retail 53 73.58% 79.25% 83.02% Hotel/Food service 54 77.78% 75.93% 70.38% Manufacturing 64 81.25% 82.81% 76.56% Health care/Social assistance 91 82.42% 73.63% 80.22% Total average 262 78.76% 77.91% 77.54% By far, retail workers feel the least valued by their employers, with only ~3 in 4 feeling valued. Conversely, healthcare and social assistance workers feel the most valued by companies. Unfortunately, there is still a lot of work to be done. Only one of the groups we highlighted felt more valued than the survey average. Most of the employees surveyed would be more productive if recognized more frequently. The frequency of recognition impacts manufacturing workers the most, while healthcare workers are less impressed. Last, retail workers strongly feel that recognition for their contributions improves their employee engagement, while hotel/food service workers aren't as pulled by praise for their work. Overall, this paints a clear picture: more recognition could lead to better outcomes for most deskless workers . 7 tips for improving recognition for deskless workers So, now that you understand why you need to invest in recognizing your workers, how do you make it a reality? Here are some strategies your company can use (no matter your team size.) 1. Rethink your beliefs about how often you should recognize employees Have you ever heard the phrase: “Won’t giving out more recognition make our team members value it less?” While providing more recognition can feel like spoiling your employees, the data doesn’t support that. Our same employee recognition statistics survey found that employees felt more valued by their employer when they received recognition more frequently. While 94.4% of employees felt valued when receiving weekly praise, only 68.2% felt valued when receiving quarterly recognition. When employees received recognition yearly, the outcomes were much worse because only 37.2% of employees felt valued in that scenario. If you are depriving your team of frequent praise, consider what providing it more often could do for your bottom line. 2. Define goals for your recognition program Before investing in appreciation, it's essential to understand and define your goals. Once you understand your goals, you can track the right metrics and create a program that helps you meet your intended results. Here are a few examples of the goals you might have: Improve retention at the organization Spot potential workplace leaders for deeper mentorship Encourage employees in between yearly review cycles Build camaraderie in the workplace. 3. Train your people managers Managers are one of your best assets when it comes to giving recognition. 47% of deskless workers surveyed value recognition from managers over praise from peers. If you want to improve the impact of your recognition program, managers need to understand how to give timely and specific feedback. Training managers on how to make time for recognition, what a good worker shoutout looks like, and how to understand their worker's praise preferences are key. 4. Encourage peers to get involved Another way to increase praise at work is by getting peers involved. Colleagues are often able to see things that managers and executives don't. For example, they know when a colleague went above and beyond to serve a customer or help a coworker by picking up a shift. Peers often highlight the type of praise that leaders want to see. How do workers act when managers aren't around to see them? But, getting peers involved takes effort. Some workers might be afraid to recognize each other, especially if you have created an environment based on heavy competition for scarce company resources. Workers also value recognition from peers, but you have to set them up for success before implementing a peer recognition program. Make sure workers know you value their input Show each team member how to send a good shoutout (get managers involved if you need to) Give team members time during the shift to recognize each other 5. Lead by example Praise isn’t a one-and-done experience. It needs to be something you continually push and promote. If company leaders aren’t actively giving out recognition, eventually others will stop too. Company leaders and executives should focus on creating a recognition habit. Solicit shoutouts from your general managers that you share with the entire company on a monthly basis. If you’re able to give praise in person, do it. Even five minutes to walk the building and say thank you to employees can make a huge difference. The goal is to ensure that praise is woven into the fabric of your organization. You don't want it to be a last-minute afterthought to pull out when engagement is down. Instead, you want it to happen as often as possible. 6. Tie recognition to tangible gifts and prizes Once a worker receives recognition, what can they do with it? Giving workers access to fun prizes like gift cards, company swag, and experiences can take praise to the next level. There are many ways that you can tie recognition to tangible gifts. Some companies do something manually, like giving out recognition cards that can be accumulated and turned in for fun prizes. While manual processes can work, it can be challenging for employees to keep track of these physical cards. Most of all, it's difficult for companies to budget for these rewards and track where cards go. Could you end up rewarding the wrong employee because they happened to pick up a lost card? Many companies are turning to employee recognition tools to make the process easier to manage and more cost-effective. 7. Invest in an employee recognition software After you've invested energy in workplace praise, it often makes sense to transition to employee recognition software . Technology can help you streamline the process across your organization, effectively budget reward spending, and help your workers feel valued at work. Here are a couple of must-haves for picking the right employee recognition platform. 1. Ease of use How much training will workers need to use the tool effectively? Will administrators spend hours learning how to use your chosen platform? The platform you pick should be straightforward. Tools like Nectar will likely resemble the social media feeds most workers use today. 2. Mobile app access Many deskless workers don't have access to a company computer, but most have a mobile phone. Therefore, you must ensure that any company you consider has a platform that can be accessed via a mobile phone browser or application. 3. Email address flexibility In your business, managers and leaders may be the only people who have official email addresses, but you need everyone to have access to a recognition tool. Look for programs that give you flexibility on which emails go into the platform. For example, can you use Gmail and Yahoo addresses, or do they need to be company branded? 4. Integrations You want a platform that can sync with your HRIS platform , so you have one source of truth for the worker in your company. Tools like Nectar sync with most HRIS platforms and give you peace of mind when employees are hired, fired, or move departments. 5. Analytics Last, you need a tool that can give you basic analytics to strengthen your employee recognition process. Recognition can be improved, but keeping up with the shoutouts shared across your organization is often challenging. When you use a recognition tool, you'll be able to understand precisely where praise is flowing in your organization. For example: If recognition is tracked, you can look at how individual managers are doing with praise. You can then see how productive those teams are based on other analytics you have access to. Conclusion As you move to increase retention and improve employee engagement , recognition often comes up. Deskless workers deserve praise for the work they do every day. From frontline healthcare workers to retail employees stocking shelves, our lives would be very different without these employees. Thankfully investing in the retention of these workers doesn't cost as much as we think. If you are new to this experience, you can start by simply writing thank you notes or providing the occasional gift card to employees while they’re working. Once you’re ready, you can take praise to the next level by investing in software that helps you streamline the process and give employees a wider variety of rewards. No matter where you are on your journey, your team will appreciate your focus on improving engagement and retention.

Share this article Employee retention is essential when it comes to long-term success for any business. Companies who realize the value of their employees and invest in them appropriately ensure that they stay motivated and dedicated to the job. This helps the organization retain its best talent and provides many financial and strategic benefits. What is employee retention and why is it important? Employee retention is an organization's ability to retain its employees and ensure their sustainability. It refers to the organizational policies and practices designed to encourage employees to remain employed by the company. Employee retention techniques ensure that the current workforce remains motivated and engaged, which helps reduce turnover and maintain productivity levels. Employee retention is essential to any organization since it helps create stability and consistency in the workforce. Retaining employees means they will remain loyal to the organization, which can help decrease costs associated with recruiting and training new employees. Employee retention can also improve workplace morale, resulting in higher productivity and better customer service. What is an example of employee retention? Employee retention examples include providing attractive and competitive salaries, offering flexible working hours, creating a positive work culture and environment, and providing career development opportunities. The hidden costs of high employee turnover High employee turnover can lead to many hidden yet significant costs that ultimately impact a company's long-term success. Reduced Organizational Knowledge: High employee turnover can decrease collective organizational knowledge and experience, as essential strategies and processes get lost between employee changes. High Recruitment Costs: With more frequent employee turnover, companies will often need to invest additional funds into recruitment activities such as advertising, interviewing, onboarding, and training new hires. Low Employee Engagement: When employees are constantly leaving or being replaced by other staff, developing a solid connection to the company mission and their peers can be challenging, leading to lower morale and decreased productivity. Decreased Productivity Levels: When employees don't have enough time to become comfortable with roles and responsibilities due to high turnover rates, they may be unable to meet established performance standards or have difficulty delivering expected results on time. Higher Staffing Levels: A high employee turnover rate can also mean that companies must maintain higher staffing levels than necessary to accommodate sudden personnel changes. What is Employment Retention? Effective retention of staff involves creating an environment where employees feel valued and committed to staying in their roles. Offering competitive wages and benefits, development opportunities, and work-life balance initiatives, among other measures, are all essential components of an effective retention strategy. Other reasons why employee retention is important Employee retention is essential to any successful business strategy; it involves creating an environment in which employees are motivated to stay in their roles and remain committed to the organization's mission. Below are some of the significant benefits associated with employee retention: Reduced Costs: Retention of staff can significantly reduce costs associated with recruitment, onboarding, and training new employees. Increased Productivity: Employees who stay in their roles for extended periods are more likely to be more productive and efficient in the workplace since they better understand their job responsibilities and the company's objectives. Higher Customer Satisfaction: Long-term employees often have an enhanced ability to build strong relationships with customers and to provide quality customer service. Improved Morale: Companies prioritizing employee retention create a culture of trust, respect, and loyalty; this creates a more positive work environment that increases overall morale and reduces absenteeism. Enhanced Reputation: Employers who retain their staff tend to develop an excellent reputation amongst job seekers and potential recruits; this helps make them attractive employers for potential high-level talent or other skilled professionals who want to join a thriving organization with low turnover rates. What Causes Low Employee Retention? There are several potential causes for low employee retention in the workplace. Some of the most common include: Poor job fit When employees are not compatible with their job position or its requirements, they may be more likely to resign when presented with other opportunities that better suit their skill set and ambitions. As the employer, it's crucial to ensure that job candidates are adequately assessed for their fit and potential contributions before hiring. Lack of recognition and appreciation Providing recognition and appreciation for employees' hard work can positively impact morale, performance, and motivation; without this, employees may feel undervalued and unsatisfied. Unclear expectations and goals Establishing clear objectives helps foster understanding between employer and employee; when expectations are unclear, employees may become frustrated or confused about their responsibilities and goals, leading to decreased satisfaction with their role. Lack of career development opportunities Employees need to feel that there is potential for growth within the company so that they can develop new skills and knowledge; providing career development pathways helps establish trust between employers and staff, which encourages them to stay longer in their roles. Poor management and leadership Individuals in positions of authority can create an atmosphere of support or frustration, depending on how they lead. Poor management can contribute to lower morale and a lack of trust, which may increase staff turnover rates. Poor compensation and benefits packages If compensation packages are inadequate compared to industry standards or do not meet the needs of employees, then this could be a contributing factor as well; ensuring attractive salary ranges will help companies retain top talent who would otherwise look elsewhere for higher wages or more attractive benefits packages. Unsatisfactory work-life balance Employees who face excessively long hours or feel their work negatively affects their personal lives may resign to regain control over their lives and prioritize their well-being. Employers to be aware of their employees' workloads and other commitments outside of work and value work-life balance for all staff. Negative workplace culture The social environment also has a significant impact on employee retention; if employers don’t promote a respectful culture where everyone feels included, then people may not want to stick around very long if there is a constant conflict being generated from specific individuals on staff or if general morale is low due to disagreements amongst team members on projects. Overall, employee retention is critical for any organization because it helps ensure a productive work environment through improved morale and reputation and can provide tangible benefits such as cost savings. However, employers need to be aware of many potential causes of low retention to create an attractive workplace that retains its top talent. Strategies for Improving Employee Retention Improving employee retention is possible if employers are willing to invest in their employees and create a workplace culture that fosters loyalty. Implementing the following strategies can help improve retention: Invest in onboarding and orientation processes Helping to ensure that new employees receive the necessary training and support they need to feel comfortable and confident in their role is essential for maintaining long-term employee retention. Develop career development opportunities Providing career path opportunities for staff will give them incentives to stay, as they can explore new roles and responsibilities within the same organization rather than looking elsewhere. Encourage engagement through recognition and rewards Employers should find ways to recognize and reward employees for their contributions, as this will help maintain morale and loyalty within the organization. Develop mentorship programs to foster relationships between employees and managers Developing mentorship programs to foster relationships between employees and managers helps to create strong connections between employees and management, which is essential for long-term employee retention. Offer competitive compensation packages that are tailored to the job role Demonstrating appreciation for employees and their positions is integral for keeping them motivated and committed to their workplace. Provide meaningful perks and rewards Providing perks like paid time off, flexible working hours, and even discounts can help motivate employees and make them feel more valued, which is a critical factor in employee retention. Create a positive work environment with clear expectations and goals Creating a positive work environment with clear expectations and goals will foster a sense of belonging and purpose and create an atmosphere where employees are more likely to remain engaged and loyal. Invest in employee training and development opportunities Investing in employee training and development opportunities offers a variety of benefits, such as increasing job satisfaction, developing new skills, and providing a clear path for career growth - all of which are essential factors when it comes to retaining employees. Promote a healthy work-life balance Knowing that their employers understand their need for a healthy work-life balance and are willing to accommodate their needs can help employees feel more fulfilled in their roles and more loyal to their employers.

But in the hourly workforce, all too often, workers are promoted into people management positions without the right training—a misstep that can cause a lot of problems. Gallup found that 70% of the variance in employee engagement can be defined solely by the manager. That means the old expression workers leave managers, not companies isn’t just lip service. It’s fact. While hourly workers promoted into shift leaders often have a ton of operational experience, without training on how to be strong people leaders, they can inadvertently increase turnover, negatively impact their employees’ experience, and cause themselves way more stress. When hiring people manager positions or looking for employees to promote, there’s a lot you can do to prevent these issues from the start. Let’s dive into the characteristics you should look for in your next manager and what you can do to train workers to succeed in their new position. 4 qualities to look for in a good manager First, let's begin with the qualities that make a good manager. It's important to remember that some of these skills can be taught or refined over time. If you have an employee that feels like a good fit, get them the training they need to exhibit these essential qualities. Great communication skills Communication skills can make or break a worker’s experience with their manager—and the company as a result. Managers need to be able to communicate not only what they need from their team but also be able to give praise and constructive criticism. Leaders who struggle with direct conversations can create a toxic workplace for their teams. As a manager of the hourly workforce, there are many moments where communication can make a drastic difference. From finding a last-minute replacement for a shift to communicating policy changes, tone matters. Ability to speak more than one language According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , by 2030, there will be a projected 35.9 million Hispanic workers in the labor force. These employees are heavily represented in deskless industries like agriculture, cleaning/maintenance, construction, food service, and transportation/material moving. While many of these employees will speak English, some may only speak Spanish, or they may be bilingual . States like New Mexico, California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, and Nevada have labor forces where Hispanic workers comprise over 25% of the population . If your managers can speak more than one language, they can better support your team and customers to ensure they get the experience they deserve. Your managers don't need to be advanced speakers, either. Understanding a few common phrases can go a long way to make employees and customers feel appreciated. Being available and flexible to accommodate worker schedules You know how quickly things can change if you've worked an hourly gig before. Many companies run a tight ship when it comes to schedules, but life happens, and your team can't always accommodate what the company needs. Shift leaders must excel at scheduling to ensure employees have the support they need. When those moments arise, and employees can't make a shift, managers must step up and figure out the path forward. Sometimes this involves communicating with other workers and getting a shift covered, and sometimes managers might have to jump in and fill a shift themselves. Shift leaders should focus on how they show up for workers. Are your managers accommodating, or do they chastise workers when they can't make a shift? Can an employee text or call their shift lead and depend on them to answer? How a team lead handles these situations will greatly affect how their workers respond in the future. Passionate about worker development Last but not least, managers should be passionate about developing their workers. In the hourly workforce, it's common for employees to rise up in the ranks and become leaders in the organization. We've discussed how internal hires can be a great recruitment strategy . As shift leaders step into the next phase of their career journey, are they stuck in operations mode, or are they helping develop their team members? Are they having one-on-ones with teammates, training them, or recognizing their good work? Team leads who invest in their employees’ development are improving turnover and ultimately aiding the company’s bottom line. This level of dedication is hard to find, so if you see it in a worker, take note. 3 manager qualities that get in the way of success Since so many managers are promoted and might not be fully prepared for the role, they might exhibit characteristics that are damaging to their teams. Be on the lookout for these things and know when you can work with your managers to improve and when they're just not a good fit for the role. Lack of experience in a management role If you've been in the hourly industry, you may have seen a manager who doesn't have the right qualifications. Managers are often picked because they display all the right qualities as an employee, but that doesn't always translate into good leadership. For example, selling and teaching others how to sell are two different skills. So, what can companies do when they realize they have an unqualified manager? Get them training that’s easy to digest and understand. Platforms like Typsy , GoSkills , and Udemy can be excellent resources for shift leaders. You can also use platforms like 360Learning and Absorb LMS to host internal training courses. Your parent company might also provide manager training if you’re a franchise member. If you're on your own, creating a few videos that you host on YouTube or offering quarterly in-person training courses that are tailored to what your managers need help with can make a big difference. Unable to discipline workers Discipline is an essential skill for managers. When employees are allowed to be toxic and not checked by leadership, it can lead to turnover and workplace dissatisfaction. On the other hand, discipline is a nuanced process. There are laws in place to protect workers in many states, and making the wrong move could lead to lawsuits. Managers have to walk a fine line to make sure they’re standing up for workers without isolating the person who is in the wrong. On top of that, managers also need to ensure issues don't fester and become deeper problems for the company. After an employee is disciplined, there may still be some lingering behavioral problems. If that’s the case, managers need to feel comfortable taking the final step of termination. Our guide to parting ways with an employee should help managers create a process that works for the company. Neglects worker development If your management team isn’t willing to mentor their team, or they aren’t doing it enough, your organization will be in trouble as would-be leaders inevitably leave the company. Luckily, there are some strategies companies can use to help managers improve their worker development habits. For example, you could schedule a day for team training and help your team leads to develop an agenda for their teams. You should encourage managers to host regular one-on-ones with their workers to talk about what’s going well and where they need help, giving your leaders an opportunity to coach and set goals with their team members. Why it’s important to train your managers Leaders don't learn these strategies automatically when they receive a new title. It's something that needs to be developed. More than likely, you’re giving a leadership position to someone who doesn’t have formal training or someone who doesn’t have experience leading people. Training equips your managers with the tools to show up for your organization and your staff members. How do you effectively train your managers? Manager training can feel daunting at first, but it doesn’t have to be as intense as you think. Here are some simple steps you can take to train your leaders effectively: Understand where they lack . Your managers may already be great at some things, so there's no reason to train them again. Instead, work with them one-on-one to see what would be the best use of your training time. Keep it simple . Management training can be overwhelming, especially on top of other job duties. Bite-sized training works best. Focus on which training opportunities would make the most impact. For example, if your leaders need help hiring the right employees, you could do a small training on screening resumes. Make sure it makes sense . Sitting through training that doesn't apply to everyday life can be a waste of time. So when picking or creating a training session, give many relevant examples to ensure the information sticks. For instance, you could use a recent example of an incident that happened in your restaurant to train new leaders. Create an active training opportunity . It might be challenging to see how a training topic can apply in your own store. By visiting another site and auditing their store, your managers could better retain the information and get inspired to apply their learnings to their own location. Good managers can make or break the work experience for hourly workers Managers have a profound impact on the hourly workforce. Having a good manager can make working fun and engaging while working under a bad boss can make you want to call in sick or quit your job. Being a good manager isn't complicated, but it’s your job as the HR leader to ensure your new managers are set up for success. When creating a job description for your next leadership role, consider what makes the most sense for your organization. Skills like communication, flexibility, and passion for worker development go a long way.

Some owners and managers think that retaining full-time employees is more essential to make their business successful. However, this only results in poor management of part-time and hourly employees. In total, about 80.4 million hourly employees in the US make up 58.3% of the total workforce in the region. They play an integral role in keeping businesses such as retail and restaurants functional. Thus, it is essential for companies and their HR managers to learn the proper management of their hourly workers. However, this can be a challenging task especially when your hourly employees do not speak the same language as you. Aside from their complicated schedules, you also need to consider the language barrier and possible discrimination in the workplace. To help, we will discuss the challenges in managing multilingual hourly employees and what you can do to overcome them. The Importance of Language and Communication Maintaining a great relationship between multilingual hourly employees and HR managers is important. However, there are times when communicating is difficult due to the language barrier and overlapping schedules. Thus, it is important to have your means of communication such as bulletin boards, social media group pages, chat groups, or televisions in your workplace. You may also consider using translation services with language solutions that you need to make sure that multilingual employees can understand important announcements. Challenges in Management Managing multilingual hourly employees is nothing like handling full-time desk workers with consistent schedules and salary. There are a lot of challenges that you may encounter, from handling their schedules to maintaining your interactions with them. Here are some of the challenges that you may experience: Complicated hiring process There are a lot of businesses that prefer hiring multilingual employees to handle language barriers with their clients and customers. However, the hiring process can be pretty complex since you might also need to converse with them in their native language. Exhausting training for supervisors. Training multilingual hourly employees can be draining for supervisors. Their schedules vary and can be unpredictable. Thus, the supervisors might need to work on separate hours just to ensure that they can train all employees. Not to mention, multilingual trainers are pretty rare and you might need translators for effective training. Interacting with them is difficult. Aside from the language barrier, interacting with multilingual hourly employees is difficult due to their inconsistent schedules. Most HR managers are full-time workers which means that they wouldn’t be able to keep up with the hourly employees at all times. Managing their schedule is confusing. It can be pretty perplexing when scheduling a large number of hourly employees. You can’t consistently have an employee work on all busy hours and the other employees on easier shifts. Moreover, there will be part-time employees who may request a leave of absence a day or an hour before their work, and finding someone to cover their shift can be pretty difficult. Racial biases are possible. It is important to promote a healthy environment in workplaces. However, racial biases still exist in companies hiring multilingual individuals. It doesn’t help when their hourly employees also have very limited time to interact with their co-workers. Effective Ways to Engage with Multilingual Hourly Employees With all the challenges that you can encounter when managing multilingual hourly employees, it is important that you already have plans to overcome them. There is a great difference between handling them and your full-time employees. From the schedules to work obligations, there are a lot of things you need to consider when planning your methods and programs to retain them. To help you maintain a positive work environment, we will discuss the effective ways to engage with your employees: 1. Make their schedules manageable. One of the greatest challenges of multilingual hourly employees is balancing their working schedules and private responsibilities. Make sure to make it more predictable and manageable by letting your workers know their schedule 2 weeks or more in advance. This offers more time for your employees to adjust their personal schedules or ask for a leave in advance. Aside from that, you can also ask your employees if they have any preferences in working schedules whether it is due to health, familial, or religious reasons. Make sure to honor their answers or discuss with them properly if it is impossible to fulfill their requests. When scheduling, you also have to ensure that there are no biases. Make sure that the busy hours and graveyard shifts are allocated evenly with everyone else. This is to avoid overstressing your employees and making them feel like they are unfairly treated. 2. Set the importance of transparency. Honesty and trust are important between the company and its employees. Thus, it will be beneficial to let your employees know about your goals, culture, and achievements to offer a familial feeling in the workplace. It will also be beneficial to offer them help whenever they are facing problems in their work, studies, family, or financial status. To be fair, your employees should also offer transparency to your business. You can ask them to send you a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly report about their work. If the job is remote or “desk jobs,” you can ask them to install a free time tracking software that will monitor the hours they rendered and send screenshots of their screen while working. 3. Utilize anti-bias policies. It is important to utilize anti-bias policies to make sure that there are no discriminations inside your workplace especially when you hire multilingual hourly employees. Make sure that everyone is aware of the importance of respect and trust within the workstation. Post the policies on your bulletin board or social media groups if possible. Make sure that everyone is sensitive to lingual and cultural differences to avoid any misunderstandings in the workplace. If there are any important announcements, you should also translate the memorandums and messages into other languages to ensure that everyone understands them. You can also offer assistance to your employees who are suffering from unfair treatments and bullying inside the workplace. Let them know that you care for their welfare and hold meetings regarding the issue to try and resolve them. It is important to make sure that there is a corresponding penalty for those who violate the policy. 4. Have a reward system. Most companies do not offer benefits and wage increments to their hourly employees. Not to mention, the rates for them are also considerably lower than the full-time staff. To motivate your employees to do better at work, it is essential to have a reward system in your company. You can set weekly or monthly quotas or key performance indicators (KPI) that will let you know if they are working well. If they meet or exceed your expectations, you can reward them with monetary or material rewards. You should also make sure that the whole team knows about this success by posting it on your group page or mentioning them in your group chat. Final Takeaways Your multilingual hourly employees are an important asset to your company and retaining them is beneficial for the organization in the long run. Despite the challenges that you may encounter, it is vital to utilize a management plan to ensure a comfortable and healthy working environment. Make sure to build trust and understanding in your workplace by placing importance on communication, respect, transparency, and rewards to all employees. By keeping your employees motivated, you can maintain a positive work culture in your office. Moreover, having a predictable work schedule and salary will also be highly appreciated by your workers.

Don't overthink what employees are wanting. Things like giving thanks and kudos are a small example of little things that employees appreciate. Employees also want more flexibility in how and when they work. A recent Skedulo survey highlighted that flexibility would make hourly workers more likely to stay in their job, give them better work/life balance, and give them more motivation at work. But how do you provide flexibility to a workforce that can’t really work from home, works on shifts, and needs to work set schedules for the business to run efficiently? Let’s dive into the strategies you can employ to keep your business appropriately staffed while offering your team the flexibility they crave: 1. Build flexibility into your shift scheduling According to Skedulo, flexibility is as important as pay for many hourly workers. A whopping 47% of respondents would rather spend time working for a company that offered flexible scheduling over a 10% bump in pay. As a leader in the hourly workforce, there are a few things you can do to make scheduling your team more flexible—without introducing more headaches. Invest in a shift scheduling tool A shift scheduling tool is one of the most powerful resources you have in creating a flexible schedule. Empowering your team with flexible scheduling opportunities might create some complications, but you can offload some of that responsibility by investing in the right tool. With scheduling tools, you can better view worker desires and company needs. You can see everything in one place, which makes visualizing the schedule much more manageable. If you are a franchisee, your parent company might already have a scheduling tool built for you. If you're on your own, try a tool like Shiftboard , When I Work , or Buddy Punch . Create a shift pick-up policy Once you have a shift scheduling tool, you should better understand what shifts need more attention. Are some time slots the last to be picked? The first to get dropped? A shift pick-up policy will allow you to close the gap quickly. As employees need last-minute time off, where do you put their shifts? You might have a handful of trustworthy employees, but adding extra time to their schedules isn’t always a great idea. Burnout in the hourly workforce is a huge issue. If your workers can self-select which shifts they want to pick up, you can create a more flexible work environment. Many scheduling tools will give you the ability to create a better shift pick-up process. Let employees decide which shift times work for them Do you set when employees should work? Life changes quickly, and flexible scheduling means giving employees more options about when they work. Let employees share what their best shift times are. When discussing this strategy, you can say: “Our business runs because we all work hard, and you may find yourself working a shift you don’t like. I promise I will take your preferences into consideration and use my best effort to give you shifts that you will enjoy.” Next, follow up on this statement to avoid favoritism when creating your business schedule. For example, you could make the schedule and then get feedback from another leader in the company to ensure it’s fair. In addition, creating the schedule multiple weeks in advance can help you distribute work evenly across employees. Provide options for shorter shifts The traditional eight-hour shift doesn’t work as well as it used to. With companies allowing gig workers to work when they want (and for however long they want), it’s important for others in the hourly industry to provide more flexibility. Part-time or full-time work that’s more spread out could be helpful for your team. For example , a parent who needs a bit of flexibility in the morning and afternoon might want to split up their shift and cover a few hours in the morning and a few hours at night. If you’re creating a schedule based on eight-hour shifts, consider what might happen if you offered a three or four-hour shift instead. Create a shift worker pool On top of creating a pick-up policy for extra shifts, you could also create a pool of workers you can tap into if needed. Often this pool consists of former employees or anyone looking to pick up irregular shifts. Overall, these workers should be trained and ready to work if needed. 2. Strengthen trust between shift leaders and staff Shift leaders manage the schedules of dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of employees. It can be challenging to create trust between every team member, but one of the best strategies to improve trust is to be forthcoming about scheduling and any changes made. Last-minute schedule changes can make it difficult for employees to meet work expectations while balancing tasks outside of work. According to a recent analysis by The Shift Project , many workers are struggling with last-minute updates to their schedules: “Workers’ schedules are also often changed at the last minute, with 14% reporting at least one cancelled shift in the last month and 70% reporting at least one change to the timing of one of their shifts in the past month.” So, how can companies do this? Set a deadline for scheduling changes Communicate each change in schedule with a text or phone call Make other arrangements to cover last-minute shift changes 3. Provide better benefits for hourly workers When you think about who uses employee benefits , what kind of worker comes to mind? Leaders often consider office workers, and hourly workers get left behind. Yet, hourly work makes up the majority of the workforce . Some industries, like healthcare, get many benefits, while others like retail suffer. Make time off a priority One universal benefit you can provide hourly workers is paid time off . Employees from retail to healthcare struggle with getting adequate time off. These jobs are often considered essential, which makes time off challenging. Here are some strategies you can use to improve time off in the hourly workforce: Give employees a minimum time-off requirement Offer bonuses for employees to use when they take vacation time so they have extra spending money Encourage shift leaders to take vacation time and showcase good vacation habits (ex., not checking in or working while on vacation) Other flexible benefits to consider for your hourly workforce Besides time off, there are other benefits you could offer to create a more flexible work environment for employees. Here are a few that can be beneficial for your team: Medical insurance (especially plans that include mental healthcare) Education grants for continued learning Disability and life insurance policies Family planning benefits Stipends where employees can choose what benefits they need Building an hourly workforce where flexibility matters Creating flexibility in the hourly workforce won’t be easy. The way that many managers and companies currently operate doesn’t lend itself to flexible work. Meanwhile, flexible work is critical for employees who want to explore hobbies, have families, and live happier lives. Getting quality talent will become difficult if hourly industries don’t meet workforce demands. However, businesses can use many simple fixes to become more flexible, from investing in shift scheduling tools to providing shorter shifts.

When employees are engaged and focused on their work, the team and business as a whole benefit. Company culture and job satisfaction boosts will lower turnover rates, increased efficiency and productivity, created a great employee experience , and eventually lead to profitability and better employee retention . But the only way to experience these benefits is to implement an employee engagement plan that actually works. According to a Gallup survey, only 36% of the U.S. employees are actively engaged in their work. While that’s higher than it has been in recent years, it still leaves plenty of room for improvement! Here are eight of the top employee engagement strategies to optimize your workplace. What is an employee engagement strategy ? Employee engagement is how emotionally connected your team members are to their work, your organization, and its goals. Yes, the pay is important, but employee engagement goes beyond the paycheck and it’s not a typical business metric . But your employees actually want to contribute toward the business’s goals, which makes the company that much more productive. It’s also directly related to employee satisfaction , which helps decrease expensive employee turnover rates and counter-acts any burnout that employees are facing. Employee engagement strategies are the initiatives management takes to create an environment in which employees can become more engaged and establish a positive connection with the business to produce better business outcomes . Employee engagement doesn’t just happen; it needs to be stimulated. And these strategies will determine whether your employees are actually engaged with your organization and its goals or if they’re just there for the paycheck. Employee engagement plans that actually work According to surveys, 94% of companies have some sort of employee engagement strategy . However, of those companies, less than 42% have a formal employee engagement program with an action plan , check-ins , and actual development opportunities . It’s easy to think that you can get buy-in from your employees as long as you’re friendly and fair, but it takes more than that to create an engaged team. If you’re ready to implement a formal employee engagement plan that actually works, here are eight employee strategies you can use to create a more effective and engaged team: 1. Ask your team for feedback The first employee engagement strategy is the simplest: employee feedback . Employee engagement surveys are a great way to determine how your team members feel about your organization at a certain point in time and identify areas of improvement. It’s not always easy for management to see where they need to improve to increase employee engagement . Things look a bit different from the alternate perspective, and your employees might feel less engaged because of a process you hadn’t even thought about. Once you understand where your team is struggling to engage, you can take action to correct those issues and increase employee engagement . Pulse surveys , employee development , employee connection, employee recognition , and going the extra mile are all common actions that can be learned through employee feedback . As an added bonus, the simple act of asking for your team members ’ opinions shows that you care about their perspective and wellbeing . Simply handing out a survey is one simple way to boost employee engagement — although you should still follow up with other strategies! 2. Create an engagement team If your team members are the best ones to identify areas of improvement, then they’re probably also the best people to implement the changes, too! Forming a team of employees that are drivers of employee engagement is a great way to efficiently implement improvements on the day-to-day and increase buy-in from the rest of your company. An employee engagement team is a group of team members — ideally someone from each level of your organization — dedicated to improving engagement and employee satisfaction throughout the company. The best employee engagement teams are small, typically between eight and ten members. They should also be filled with some of your top-performers. Members should be passionate about what they do, to ensure they’ll take the role seriously and that they understand the ins and outs of working at the company. When you’re ready to start making your engagement team, ask for volunteers first. People who volunteer to be on an employee engagement team are typically the most passionate and engaged — exactly the type of people you want heading up such an important assignment as implementing your employee engagement strategies . Fill out the team (if necessary) with your most hardworking, well-liked, and enthusiastic employees. The goal of the team is to come up with solutions designed to boost employee engagement and resolve any issues identified in the engagement surveys. Since you chose team members from each level of your company, they will also be able to discuss with other employees to find the absolute best decisions that work for everyone. 3. Maintain communication with remote and distributed teams Absenteeism has become a big issue as of late. Between 2019 and 2021, the number of remote workers in the U.S. tripled! This change in scenery also brought some new difficulties to the workforce. One of which being engagement rates. It’s not always easy to stay engaged with your work when you’re not even in the office, but it’s essential if you want to maintain your employee engagement strategies and continue to lift company culture ! According to a recent study, people who worked primarily remotely expressed 182% less engagement compared to those who work in-office. Because of this difference in engagement levels, it’s important to remember that your remote team members are still a part of your team. Remember to maintain constant lines of communication with both remote and off-site workers, so they feel a part of the organization. Technology is also a helpful way to maintain your employee engagement strategies with remote employee. For example, videoconferencing instead of phone calls helps connect a face to the voice. When remote employees can actually see everyone, it makes them feel like a part of the team rather than being left out. It’s also important to make sure that all of your employees, including remote and distributed teams, have access to all the same amenities. Giving perks or equipment to one team and not the others will cause those without to feel left out and, therefore, less engaged. 4. Offer perks and incentives When you make work all about, well… work, it creates a less engaging atmosphere. It tells your employees that they’re just there to do a job and that the company doesn’t really care about them beyond that capacity. If the company doesn’t care about the employees, why should the employees care about the company? By offering incentives and perks as one of your employee engagement strategies , you can show them that the company does, in fact, care about more than just the work they produce. You care about their well being . Think about introducing amenities to the office that makes employees happy, like snacks, actually decent coffee, and maybe even allowing pets in the office. These are little things that go a long way to boost employee engagement and make them feel more at home when they’re at work. Outside of the office, you can also offer additional perks , like gym discounts or continuing education programs. This shows the company is investing in its employees, so it encourages them to invest more in the company as well. 5. Build a better work-life balance Although it might feel like it sometimes, employees aren’t machines designed to do a specific work-related activity. They’re real people with real lives outside of work. The more a business can do to promote a balance between these two worlds, the more engaged employees will be. The key to the infamous work-life balance is flexibility. Giving your team the ability to handle their life as they need (both in and outside of work) will go a long way to keep them engaged with your company. For example, offering generous PTO policies or the opportunity to work from home certain days allows employees to choose the path that works for them and handle both the demands from work and life more fluidly. Yes, implementing these employee engagement strategies will come at a cost to your company, but it won’t be nearly as much as replacing unengaged and unhappy employees! 6. Provide opportunities for growth Stagnation is the engine that drives disengagement . Doing the same thing day in and day out with no end (or change) in sight is not healthy for engagement or productivity. Your employees want to know they’re able to grow or work toward something, so show them! Providing opportunities for growth and advancement is a great employee engagement strategy to introduce to your workplace. Don’t just assume every employee is satisfied with their current position. Make different career paths available, obvious, and attainable. When people have something to work toward, they’re more engaged in their current tasks. Also, if they know advancement opportunities are available, employees are less likely to leave. If you want to kick your employee engagement strategies into high gear, don’t just provide growth opportunities; promote them! Encourage employees to pursue the opportunities that interest them most, even if it’s a lateral move to a different department. You want your team members to be satisfied with the work they’re doing. That’s the key to engagement! 7. Redesign your workspace Most full-time employees spend upwards of 35 hours every week in the office. That’s a lot of time to be staring at dingy walls and boring decorations. By redesigning your workspace, you can create more engagement with your team. Think about introducing more colors and artwork into your workspace as one of your employee engagement strategies . Create a fun atmosphere that will make your employees feel more creative and engaged with their work. You’ve heard the expression “you are what you eat.” Well, your office performs how it’s decorated. If your office décor says, “all business,” that’s what your employees will likely feel, which doesn’t help engagement rates. It’s also a good idea to redesign the space to suit different kinds of work. For example, create spaces for different types of work. Bright and open spaces are great for creative collaboration, while smaller offices and conference rooms are best for closed-door meetings. Just like with the work-life balance , allowing your team to choose the type of environment that best suits the project they’re working on increases flexibility and freedom, helping employees feel more engaged. 8. Always continue looking for ways to improve Just because you implemented a few changes doesn’t mean your job is finished. Employee engagement is an ongoing project that never ends. Even if you think your employee engagement plan is absolutely perfect, keep looking for new ways to engage with your team. Even if you don’t find anywhere to improve right away, your employees will see your tireless efforts to create a better work environment , and that alone will increase engagement. Enjoy the benefits of employee engagement strategies An engaged workforce is a productive workforce. It makes sense: If someone is actively engaged in what they’re doing, they’ll be more efficient and productive with their work. And when your entire team is engaged, they’ll be more invested in the goals of the company as a whole. Not only will engagement help your organization be more productive, but you’ll also help increase employee satisfaction . And happy employees are employees who stay with your business for a long time. Turnovers are expensive, so the happier and more engaged you can make your employees, the better it’ll be for your bottom line . The best way to increase employee engagement and reap the benefits is to implement employee engagement strategies . Communicate with your employees to identify opportunities to improve engagement and provide plenty of flexibility, benefits, and amenities to encourage a better work environment . And never stop looking for ways to improve! With a solid employee engagement strategy , your business can benefit from the buy-in of your entire team to work toward your shared goals and achieve ongoing success.

Congratulations! You just got a new job! No matter where you’re working or whether it’s a part- or full-time position, one thing is for sure: You’re probably already anticipating that first paycheck. But before you get it, it’s important to ensure you understand what you can expect on your pay stub so there aren’t any surprises. You’ll realize that your calculated pay isn’t as simple as multiplying your hourly pay by how many hours you work. There will be taxes withheld and potential deductions that will affect the amount you receive in your check. And if you don’t know how to read your pay stub, it can be confusing to figure out how your take-home pay was actually calculated. In this article, we’ll break down the anatomy of a pay stub so you know exactly what to expect when that sweet first payday finally comes. Breaking down your pay stub First thing first: What is a pay stub? A pay stub is a document that summarizes how your earnings were distributed during a certain pay period. It typically has three parts: how much you’re getting paid, your taxes, and your deductions. In addition to personal information like your name or employee ID, your pay stub will cover a lot of important information you will want to review and retain for your records. If you regularly check your pay stubs for accuracy, you can also hold your employer accountable to ensure you’re getting paid correctly. Let’s walk through each pay stub section together. Pay period Every pay stub you receive covers a specific pay period—this could be weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly, depending on your employer’s pay schedule. The pay period shows the start and end dates for the time covered in your check. This is especially helpful if you want to verify that you’re being paid for all hours worked, including any overtime, holiday, or weekend hours. Hours worked and pay rate This section tracks all hours you’ve worked, broken down by type: regular, overtime, and any premium hours (such as holiday hours). You’ll want to check this carefully to ensure all shifts and special pay rates are recorded accurately, especially if you’re picking up extra shifts, working split shifts, or working late into the night. This section can be a good checkpoint to make sure no hours are missed. Gross pay The gross pay number is the amount you earned before any deductions or taxes were taken out. For hourly workers, there’s a lot that can go into this number. Your hours worked multiplied by your hourly rate (Note: This can vary depending on whether you worked shifts at different rates in the same pay period. For example, if you worked overtime, you want to check that those hours are calculated at the correct overtime rate.) Tips (allocated, reported, and/or pooled tips) will also appear in this section, though they may also appear in the deductions section if your employer handles tax withholdings on tips Any shift or sales bonuses You may also see an item for Minimum Wage Adjustments. This is any additional compensation provided to meet minimum wage standards Before you get too excited about this number, remember that this won’t be the amount you actually take home. Deductions The deductions category is a catch-all for anything subtracted from your gross pay. Deductions include mandatory taxes (like federal, state, and local taxes), garnishments (like child support), as well as any voluntary deductions you’ve opted into, such as health insurance, retirement contributions, or employee-funded benefits. These deductions vary greatly by employer and whether or not you work enough hours to qualify for full-time benefits. Common hourly worker-specific deductions might include: Tax withholding (Federal and State): As an hourly worker, your tax withholdings are often calculated based on each individual paycheck, meaning that varying hours and overtime can change how much is withheld from pay period to pay period. Uniform or equipment deductions: In certain industries, hourly workers may see deductions related to uniforms, tools, or other work-related items if these aren’t provided by the employer. Note: Most hourly workers should expect to fill out a W-4 form when they’re initially hired, which covers a variety of information, like if you work any other jobs. Your W-4 will directly impact the deductions taken out of your paycheck, so if you ever have any questions about what you see on your pay stub, it’s important to reach out to your company’s HR rep. It’s also good practice to revisit your W-4 each year, even if you stay at the same job, to ensure tax withholdings reflect your current financial situation. Net income (Net pay) One of the most important numbers on your pay stub is your net income or net pay. This is the amount you'll take home after all the deductions have been made. For hourly workers, net income can vary widely depending on hours worked, overtime, and deductions. Since this is the final “take-home pay” amount, it’s a good idea to review it each pay period to ensure there are no unexpected deductions and to verify that it matches the hours you worked. Year-to-date (YTD) The year-to-date amount conveys how much you have earned so far within the calendar year. You may also see this number displayed as YTD. This is helpful if you’re tracking annual earnings, aiming for a certain income target, or wanting to see how much you’ve contributed to benefits or tax deductions. For hourly workers, this number can fluctuate, especially if your hours vary from week to week, making it a good reference for tracking progress toward yearly financial goals. Sometimes, you’ll also see Accrued Paid Time Off listed in this section. This tracks accrued, used, and remaining hours for vacation, sick time, or other types of paid leave, offering a snapshot of PTO balance for hourly workers. In summary Understanding each section of your pay stub helps you stay on top of your earnings, deductions, and overall financial well-being. For hourly workers, where hours and income may fluctuate week to week, regularly reviewing your pay stub can be a powerful tool to avoid any surprises and ensure you’re getting paid accurately. By staying informed and proactive, you’re better equipped to make confident financial decisions and address any discrepancies right away. Remember, if you ever have questions about your pay, don’t hesitate to reach out to your HR representative—they’re there to help make sure everything adds up for you.

The faithful job posting - the first contact job seekers have with potential employers - is often the deciding factor in whether they apply or not. Crafting job postings that accurately reflect your company's culture and job requirements can help you attract the right talent. The research points to the value of a well-built job posting. Nearly 21% of companies surveyed by Indeed said they had to revise job postings due to a lack of interest or applicants not understanding the role. To narrow down the job pool to the best possible candidates, learning how to craft job postings that stand out is vital. By understanding best practices and looking at a job posting examples from some of the top job sites and free job posting sites , companies can ensure their job postings successfully attract job seekers’ attention. What Makes An Excellent Job Posting? We live in a social media world - so your job posting must stand out and grab eyes if you want job seekers to consider applying. The best job postings draw job seekers’ attention and provide them with an insider view of what it would be like to work at your company. Here are some of the key elements of the best job posts: 1. A Clear and Creative Job Title Quality job postings put the heavy lifting on the job title. So you'll want to make sure that the title accurately describes the job's responsibilities and makes job seekers want to learn more. Try to be creative with your job titles, too! How you title the job will speak volumes about the culture of your team. If you are looking for a skilled developer, you could choose \" Senior Developer \" or \" Creative and Experienced Software Engineer.\" But if you want to spice up the job listing a bit and draw job seekers in, you could go with \"Software Jedi\" or \"Coding Wizard.\" Strike a balance between job posting accuracy and job title creativity - job seekers will be more likely to click through if your job posting stands out. 2. A Detailed Job Description Writing a detailed job description is key for job postings that stand out. You should explain the scope of the job, the expected responsibilities, and any qualifications or experience required for the job. Make job seekers want to join your team by listing all the benefits and perks of working at your company. What goes into a description? Beyond just job requirements, job postings should use words that job seekers are looking for and include the right keywords. Job posters should also provide job seekers with an inside view of what it is like to work on the team and any company culture details that could help job seekers make an informed decision. 3. Transparent Details About The Open Position The devil is in the details - and if your job posting doesn't give job seekers the full picture, they might be less likely to apply. Be as transparent as possible when providing job details - job seekers should know not only what you're looking for in the job but also how much it pays and what the job environment is like. Recent surveys have found that 79% of job searchers want postings to offer clear pay and benefits data. Of those, a growing number (32%) want the posting to feature the exact salary range that applicants can expect. However, only 17% of companies are offering job postings that provide this salary data upfront. 4. Links to Your Company Website Whether job seekers see your job posting on a job board or during their job search, include links to your website and other online resources. By providing job seekers with easy access to information about the company, job searchers can get a better idea of what it's like to work at your organization - which might influence them to apply. If job seekers don't have easy access to information about the company, they may decide that it's not worth spending the time and effort to apply for a job at your organization. 5. Easy Next Steps What do you need from job seekers? Make sure job postings are clear on the expectations for job applications. Are you asking job seekers to submit a resume, fill out an application form, or complete other tasks as part of the job application process? Also, make sure job postings provide job seekers with easy next steps after their initial contact. For example, if your job posting asked jobseekers to submit their resumes, job postings should explain the next steps in the job application process - such as a phone interview or an in-person meeting. Want to boost your chances of finding quality candidates? Utilize an automated CV or job application system that pulls in candidate data from LinkedIn and job boards. That way, job seekers can have a streamlined job application experience to ensure all your job postings reach the right candidates. How Do You Write A Job Posting? The above elements should go into every job posting. But, some variations may be necessary depending on the job type and job seeker needs. For example, job postings for creative industries may require more detailed job descriptions that emphasize design skills, while job postings for customer service roles might include information about handling customer complaints. Here are a few tips for job postings that will attract the right job seekers: Research job seekers and use their language in job postings. Be sure to research job seeker profiles, interests, skills, and qualifications to tailor job postings to the right audience. Utilize creative job posting examples from successful companies. Look at job postings already out there - what job postings have worked for other companies? What job boards and platforms are job seekers using to look for jobs? Target job seekers directly with job postings. Utilize job search filters, keywords, and job classification codes to target the right job seekers and ensure your job postings reach the right people. Format the job advertisement properly. Use a mix of text blocks, bullet points, and eye-catching content to help boost your post. Add in extra elements. Get creative with FAQs, testimonials, and other elements that will offer more information while keeping the content varied. By utilizing job postings that address job seeker needs and leveraging job search platforms, employers can attract the right job seekers and find the perfect candidate for their open job positions. What Is An Example Of Job Posting Success? To give you an idea of a potentially successful job posting, let's look at a couple of examples that encapsulate job seeker's needs and interests. 1.

This job posting uses creative language to highlight the job's unique benefits and qualifications. It also gives job seekers a clear understanding of what they will be doing, who they will work with, and how successful campaigns are measured. The job posting also emphasizes company culture by mentioning the unlimited vacation days - something that job seekers appreciate when looking for job opportunities.

If your employer brand is fun and engaging, then bring that into the job posting as well! How Can I Make An Attractive Job Posting? Key Tips If you want your job posting or job announcement to really stand out, there are a few key tips to keep in mind. 1. Float The Talent's Interests To The Top You'll likely want to talk about your company, but what is the job seeker most interested in? Keep the most important information upfront, and ensure job seekers know what they'll do on the job. 2. Showcase The Benefits & Perks People want to work for a company where they’ll feel appreciated - so showcase any benefits or perks that come with the position. This could include on-the-job training, flexible hours, excellent pay and benefits, job security, or other incentives. 3. Utilize Keywords In The Job Title & Description We live in a digital age - so make sure you utilize keywords to optimize your job postings for search engines like Google and job boards like LinkedIn. This helps job seekers find a job more easily. 4. Keep It Simple & Concise Nobody likes job postings that are long-winded and full of jargon. Keep your job description concise and easy to understand. If job seekers can't quickly determine what the job entails, they're likely to skip it altogether! Boost Success With Your Job Ads The best job postings are the ones that will land the job seekers you want. So make sure you focus on showcasing your company's culture, and highlight the benefits of working with your team. By investing time into creating a clear and concise job posting, you will have much better luck finding the right candidate for your position.

Share this article Hiring has come a long way since “Help Wanted” signs and handshakes. Today, as companies move faster and rely more on digital solutions, hiring managers have access to powerful software that can help them source candidates and fill open positions with much better efficiency. Enter the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) . What features does an ATS have? Different Applicant Tracking Systems come with a suite of different features. Businesses should take care to evaluate the ones they need and weigh the cost of the ATS, which can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars a month. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution for every business, there are some features that may be the deciding factor for your business. Here is a  list of some common and uncommon ATS features. Post to multiple job sites at once -- An ATS that integrates with multiple job boards allows users to post job listings instantly, all at the same time. Not only does this help save time and effort, as mentioned before, but the posts can be scheduled as well, allowing for more convenience (load up job opening into the ATS on Friday, schedule them to post first thing Monday) and better coverage. This feature can be a major boost to a company having trouble sourcing good candidates. Facilitate new methods to apply -- According to Indeed, 78% of people in the US would apply to jobs on their mobile devices if the process were simplified . ATS’s can provide that portal (via text messaging or QR codes) for applicants to apply by phone to your business. Especially popular for younger job seekers, this feature can lower barriers when applying, resulting in more applications. Intelligently optimize your job postings -- Many ATS’s have built-in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can automatically choose the best job boards for your job listing. Since the hundreds of places to post can be overwhelming, the algorithm can seek out the job boards that best performed for a given type of job opening in the past to get you the highest ROI, especially when some job boards charge a fee to post. Filters out and sorts applicants -- One of the most crucial features of a good ATS is intelligently filtering out the qualified applicants from the unqualified, automatically. For example, if a role requires a certain certification or license, the ATS can scan resumes for those keywords and automatically reject the ones that do not meet the criteria. This way, hiring managers only have to spend their time on the candidates that actually have a chance to be hired. Schedules interviews -- Like it or not, scheduling the job interview(s) or forgetting to show up for one are both common problems in the hiring process. The job of an ATS is to take care of this for you and the candidate, making it dead simple to put the interview into both party’s calendars, as well as send timely reminders for the interview. Visualized hiring dashboards -- Imagine if a hiring manager could log into a system and see how the various job openings at their company are progressing at a glance. Most applicant tracking systems provide easy-to-read dashboards to show the status of the hiring funnel. Provide hiring analytics -- With all the data collected by the ATS , users can pull trends in their hiring process to improve their whole funnel. Where are the bottlenecks? Which job boards perform the best? Is your time-to-hire decreasing overall? The system is not just a repository of candidate data, but a way to utilize the data to improve the process from top to bottom. Paperless onboarding and training -- The ATS should be able to handle all the paperwork that used to be a headache when it was a manual process. As soon as a candidate is marked as hired, the ATS can send out W2 forms, employee handbooks, and even links to training videos to onboard new hires quickly. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be useful to have an entirely paperless way of bringing on a new hire remotely. What is an ATS? An Applicant Tracking System is a software application or platform that helps manage a company’s hiring process by maintaining a database of candidates and job openings, while providing an organized, actionable flow of the hiring process. Typically, when a resume or job application is submitted online, the candidate’s data is fed into an ATS. Once the candidate is stored in the database, the hiring manager can use the system to quickly bring up their information and take specific actions on their profile throughout the hiring process. Why use an ATS? If your local hardware store needs to hire a single employee, that business can manage just fine with a manual process. Joe Hardware can accept a paper resume in person, which can be filed in a drawer to be reviewed at the leisure of the manager. If the resume looks good, the manager can then reach out to schedule an interview. Now consider a company like Amazon that has to hire 30,000 workers at a time . That manual way of hiring will quickly get out of hand, slowing down the process to fill these open positions. In fact, Amazon might have to hire just as many hiring managers to manage all their hiring! Instead, Amazon and over 98% of Fortune 500 companies use an ATS to facilitate their hiring process. Using software, a small team of hiring managers can oversee the hiring of tens of thousands of employees. ATS’s saves time, speeds up time-to-hire, and greatly reduces the cost of employing more HR professionals at these companies. Keep in mind, the average salary of an HR Manager runs around $104,572 according to salary.com. Using an ATS is nearly guaranteed to pay for itself over the course of a year. Can an SMB benefit from an ATS? While Applicant Tracking Systems are basically table-stakes for an enterprise-level company, small-to-medium sized companies may question whether they need to employ this software for their own hiring needs. After all, your company may have greater hiring needs than Joe Hardware, but you’re nowhere near the level of an Amazon. Well consider this: according to research out of Glassdoor, the average overall job interview process takes 22.9 days in the U.S . And that’s the average! That means half of all hiring timetables last nearly a month, which is long enough that companies regularly lose out on talent who can go to their competition. SMBs can’t afford to lose out on great talent since they make less hires. Speeding up the hiring process gives businesses a huge boost, especially in competitive industries. Sourcing candidates is also tough for SMBs. Manually posting job openings to Monster, Craigslist, Indeed, etc. can take up a great deal of time; and that’s only scratching the surface since there are literally hundreds of sites to post a listing . In fact, take Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) as an example. Since fast-food locations mostly need lower-skilled employees, one could assume that sourcing talent may be relatively easy. In reality, over 56% of QSR hiring managers said they had a tough time sourcing hourly workers . The point of an ATS is to give businesses more reach in less time. When time-to-hire and sourcing are two huge hurdles for SMBs with limited resources, ATS’s can make the difference and solve these hiring pain points without having to pay high salaries for more HR personnel.

You want to hire the most qualified individuals for your business. Unfortunately, many people think that restaurants, especially quick-service restaurants (QSR), just hire anyone who shows up, which is far from the truth. Hiring managers take a lot of time and effort out of their busy schedule to post on job boards, schedule interviews, interview, and much more. Fast food jobs require a specific set of skills so restaurants need to hire individuals who are hard-working and smart. Knowing how to find and hire these individuals is an essential part any restaurant recruitment strategy. The ability to streamline this hiring process is an absolute necessity in the restaurant industry. Restaurant hiring software is rapidly becoming a must-have in the QSR space and can help restaurants hire more efficiently and effectively. Why is restaurant hiring a challenging process? Many restaurant owners don’t take the hiring process seriously. You'll often see these types of restaurants on shows like Kitchen Nightmares . The food and service you provide will reflect the level of staff training and staff motivation. Top restaurants understand this and get the best team members for the job. There are many different positions you need to fill in a restaurant. Each food service role requires a different skill set. For example, a good fry cook won’t necessarily make great sushi, and a person who makes a good latte isn’t always good at bussing tables. Whether you run the restaurant alone or have a dedicated HR person and general manager , you need to be aware of the different skill requirements for each position. Aside from the differences in skill sets, you also have to deal with employee turnover. Turnover can also be mitigated by restaurant hiring software due that enables automated screening which can catch any turnover red flags before the employee is hired. The QSR industry has the highest turnover rate across industries, with many restaurants facing between 50% to 100% employee turnover every year. Fast food restaurants also spend a total of $3.4 billion on hiring and training employees annually. What contributes to this trend? Age is one factor: a vast majority of QSR workers are 35 years old or younger, and close to 30% of QSR employees are between 19 to 26 years old . Many school students and college students work in fast food chains, which means they need a flexible schedule . You also have a lot of people employed in the sector who are looking for better job opportunities. What does this mean for you as a restaurant owner ? Following the right practices of restaurant hiring will not just improve the quality of your food or service, it will also save you a lot of time and money. 6 steps for effective restaurant hiring Restaurant hiring can be done through different channels. These include word-of-mouth, classified ads in newspapers, social media posts, referrals, job portals, or employment agencies. Regardless of the restaurant recruitment channel, though, you need to follow a few best practices that have been proven to bring in great hires, regardless of the industry: 1. Identify the roles that need to be filled Before you can build an efficient team, you need to determine the roles that you need to fill along with the functionality of those roles. For example, a typical fast-food restaurant will require cashiers or service reps, cooks or food preparers , shift supervisors, and upper management. The type of food or drinks you serve will also determine the roles that you’ll hire for. Most coffee places, for example, don’t require dedicated cooks. Instead, they will likely serve pre-made sandwiches that need a few seconds in the microwave to prepare. However, coffee houses will require baristas , especially for specialty drinks. Source: Slideteam The size and location of the restaurant will also play a role in the number and type of job openings. Restaurants in small towns, for example, might have fewer customers than those in high-traffic areas, which means a food server can also double as a busser. 2. Create an outline of responsibilities Whether you’re running a Michelin-starred restaurant or a small pop-up, you need a competent crew. You should create a detailed outline of responsibilities for each job type to ensure that whoever is in charge of hiring crew team members gets the right hires. I recommend you start this process by listing the responsibilities of each member of your team. You should then create a template job description for each position. Ensure to also assign salary ranges for the various positions and keep in mind competitive pay . The example below is a template for the job description of a waiter. Job description Position: Waiter/Waitress Main responsibilities: - Taking orders and delivering food and beverages - Helping guests with menu recommendations - Providing exceptional customer experience Waiter/Waitress job description: Our fast casual restaurant is looking for a waiter/waitress with remarkable hard skills and engaging people skills. The right person for this job should be able to handle food and beverage orders, the cash register , and deliveries. As our restaurant prides itself in providing excellent customer service, we are looking for a waiter/waitress who will treat our guests with attentiveness, patience, and a positive attitude. To help our restaurant provide a pleasurable dining experience, a good waiter/waitress should be able to ensure that our guests are fully satisfied by being friendly, courteous, accommodating, and reliable. A suitable candidate for the job should also be a problem-solver and a team player. Responsibilities of a waiter/waitress: - Greeting and escorting guests to their seats - Providing menu recommendations and additional information - Upselling additional products when appropriate - Checking ID's to prevent minors from ordering alcoholic beverages - Taking orders using software, order slips, or memorization - Communicating order details to the kitchen staff - Delivering food and beverages in a timely fashion - Cash handling - Cleaning and maintaining the appearance of tables and tableware - Providing exceptional customer experience Waiter/waitress job requirements: - Must have prior experience as a waiter/waitress - Must showcase teamwork and communication skills - Must be able to handle money and credit card transactions responsibly - Must be able to multitask and act quickly - Must be flexible and ready to work in shifts - Must possess at least a high school diploma, or equivalent There are a lot of sites online where you can find job description templates . Creating templates for each position will speed up the process of putting out job advertisements. You should also research how your employment offer compares to other restaurants in your area. If the salary you are offering is less than the average, you’ll struggle to find great staff. If it is better than the average for your area, you’ll find it easy to get great staff. A bit of competitive intelligence can provide you with great insights that will help you secure the best staff for your restaurant. 3. Identify the best way to promote the job opening You will only attract the best available talent if you advertise your job openings effectively. Start by identifying the best marketing channel for hiring staff.  There are two logical ways to identify effective marketing channels for your restaurant hiring. First, you can ask members of your staff how they found their role. Note down the channel that most people highlight. The second thing you should do is review what channels competitors are using to find new food service workers . Many candidates respond to “Help Wanted” ads they see on community bulletin boards. For example, Facebook can be a great place to post jobs. Posting a job on Facebook will allow you to reach more applicants easily. You may either post a job in a local jobseeker group or through your restaurant’s business page. Job boards like Indeed are very intuitive and have excellent promotional opportunities within the job posting itself. A restaurant hiring software like Workstream will often times post the job opening out to the job boards automatically making the experience seamless. You will also have to address employee attrition, especially in an industry where employees don’t tend to stay long. Here are some tips for posting your jobs: Be upfront: Your candidates are aware of the long hours and fast-paced environment of the fast food industry , so there’s no need to sugarcoat the job. Specifying the working hours will allow you to attract the best candidates . Use simple language: The QSR industry has spawned its jargon, but most first-time applicants would probably not understand it in a job description . Using simple language will help you attract candidates. Address employee safety: Sharing how you intend to keep staff safe, including health protocols and house rules, will convince potential employees that you care about their well-being. Highlight the benefits : You need to highlight what makes working at your restaurant special. The more effectively you can communicate the perks , the more applications you will receive. Your job advertisement is often the first point of contact for a potential employee. Try to make your job advertisement stand out. An important part of this will revolve around your ability to explain what makes working at your restaurant such a great opportunity. 4. Create an effective selection process There is a good chance your candidates have applied for jobs at other restaurants. In this industry, your recruitment process needs to be short and quick and your candidate experience needs to be good— otherwise, you’ll end up losing qualified applicants to your competition. Many applicants say that complicated hiring processes turn them off from working at an otherwise excellent workplace. Asking candidates to send their resumes and then sitting on a pile of CVs won’t do your candidates and hiring team any favors. Your online recruitment process needs to be simple. A large number of job seekers use either smartphones or tablets to look for a job. While many job board apps are designed specifically for mobile devices, you need to use a restaurant hiring software that integrates with your applicant tracking system (ATS) so that you can easily access and process candidate data. Workstream’s all-in-one applicant dashboard provides you with a holistic view of your applicants, allowing you to review and tailor processes for different candidates. McDonald’s has mastered the art of mobile recruitment marketing through the Snapchat app. Their integrations, including the Snapchat lens, allows McDonalds ’ users to take pictures of themselves in a McDonald’s uniform and submit their applications—all in just 10 seconds. The Snapchat application highlights how restaurants can use new marketing channels to connect with potential employees. That ability to utilize new marketing channels effectively can help you get more job applicants. Source: Snapchat Daily In one of the process’s pilot runs in Australia, McDonald’s received 3,000 Snapplications in the first 24 hours and hired its first crew member in just two days. Overall, 15% of applicants went to the final interview stages. It’s also being used now in the U.S, where Snapchat has a total user base of around 100 million people. 5. Make the interview count with the right questions When you’re hiring restaurant staff, it’s important to ask the right questions. Many of the candidates who come into the interview will have very little idea about the work environment of a restaurant. The interview can also serve as an introduction to the industry. Here are some questions you can ask during a restaurant job interview: Have you ever worked in fast food before? While restaurants are different from each other, some aspects are true across the food industry. This question will help you gauge the amount of training you’ll need to do if the candidate gets the job. What hours are you available? Knowing whether you’re potentially getting a part-time or full-time employee is important from the start, especially since many younger workers might be in school. Asking this question will give you an idea of the amount of time they can spend on the job. How would you handle an angry customer? Handling angry customers is part of working in a restaurant and restaurant workers should possess lots of patience. Asking situational questions like this will help you assess how the candidate will react in a possible scenario in the restaurant. What are your career goals? Fast-food workers don’t tend to stay in one job for long, but those who do tend to advance to management positions like shift managers or store managers . Do you have any questions to ask us? This question allows the applicant to share their opinions about the restaurant and how they treat workers. You can follow up with a question like this by introducing the applicant to your safety protocols, wellness programs, and benefits package. The questions above are oriented towards customer service. They give you a good idea of a potential crew member ’s attitude towards the job, the customers, and your restaurant. Additionally, it will also be prudent to ask some cultural fit questions to assess whether they are a right fit for the organization. 6. Provide proper training. The recruitment process doesn’t end when you tell an applicant that they’re hired. There is a bit of paperwork left to finish which is essential for onboarding . Systematic onboarding and training are important for a restaurant. You need to train your staff, especially if they are interacting with your customers. A well-trained staff member can help save your restaurant thousands of dollars worth of missed orders, spills, and accidents.  Before the successful candidate starts work, they need to be trained properly for their position. You need to get them up to speed on menu items , the POS system, health codes, fire codes, and safety protocols. You might also need to educate them on the finer points of dealing with customers, especially angry ones. To make the onboarding and training process smoother, Workstream offers the option to onboard and train your new hires via mobile. Text messages containing the relevant documents for onboarding will be sent automatically the moment they are hired. Training materials such as handbooks, checklists, and training videos are also sent via the same medium. An automated reminder is then sent to ensure that your new employees have completed their onboarding documents and mobile training contents. It is important that you order your training sessions logically. You want to get your staff trained and working fast. For this, you can use employee scheduling software to organize your training. A properly trained employee is poised to make a positive impact on restaurant operations. By seeing how they respond to the training, you will get a better idea of their personality and job fit. Bottomline Many restaurant owners seem to think that an efficient hiring process will only succeed in producing low-quality hires. However, just like everything else in the QSR industry, speed determines who succeeds. The less efficient your process is, the more likely you will lose a promising employee to a competitor. Hiring automation is something that restaurant managers have feared but it can more often than not be key to staying ahead of the competition. You should start by making an organizational chart of all of the positions at your restaurant from entry level to assistant manager and above. Then, list the various roles and their responsibilities. Creating this resource base will help to speed up the hiring process for your restaurant and help you with finding the right candidate and the top talent available. Once you have done this, you need to determine the best channels for promoting your job openings . Check which channels your competitors use, and review where you have got the best candidates in the past. Make sure the hiring process is straightforward and the qualified candidates will follow. Next, create a meticulous selection and interview process. Then, once you’ve selected a candidate, make sure to train the successful candidate, either physically or virtually. Restaurant hiring software will help with all of these things and should be at the top of your list when it comes to upping your application process and interview scheduling .

According to a recent Business Insider article , turnover at QSRs is currently as high as 144% in some cases. This is an astounding statistic because it demonstrates the malignant levels of turnover currently plaguing QSRs. Good hiring decisions are one of the most effective remedies for the current turnover crisis in the QSR industry. One of the key aspects of making high-quality hiring decisions is the use of assessment tools. While many QSRs may be aware of assessment tools, they may not realize that not all assessment tools are the same. In fact, poorly designed hiring assessment tools can cause more harm than good in the long run. Pre-employment assessments are usually hosted online and can include everything from work samples to tests that assess your job knowledge, skills, personality, and more. These assessments can also be administered through advanced software systems to save you time. The right hiring assessment tools will help you figure out what your job candidates' performance will be like on the job. The wrong hiring assessment tools, however, can create all sorts of problems in the future. In this article, we'll be covering how hiring assessment tools can land you in hot water if you're not careful. Basing Assessments on Your Initial Ideas When hiring a new employee, it's natural to focus on the preliminary qualities that you'd like your new hire to have. However, if you're a part of a larger team, focusing solely on your perception of which qualities would best suit the job will limit your assessment and may not help you much down the line. This is especially true if you aren't the one working directly with the new employee. A good way to ensure that your new hire has qualities that are a good match for your team is to incorporate your team members’ feedback into the final assessment of the candidate. It’s important to ensure that everyone on your team is in agreement about what exactly you're looking for in an applicant. Assessing Your Candidate Based on Their Word This isn't to say that you should discredit how your applicants describe themselves. But most people tend to put their best foot forward when it comes to job applications by leaving out any unfavorable information. Instead of assessing your candidate based on their self-described behaviors and qualifications, create a smart assessment that helps you identify their good qualities through applied knowledge. For example, if you're curious about their organizational skills, provide them with a made-up scenario, and ask them to describe how they would approach organizing the said scenario. Or let's say you're hiring for a front-line position at your QSR. You could have the applicant record themselves reading a sample script in order to assess if they're a good fit for the role. At Workstream, our smart screening feature allows you to pick out the most suitable candidates based on the criteria you set for your job position. The best part? Our screening questions are highly customizable and require little to no action from you after you have set them. Applicants who are qualified will be moved to the next round while those who are ruled out will be automatically rejected and removed from the applicant dashboard. Your Assessment is Too Lengthy or Too Broad If potential hires perceive your job assessment as too lengthy or filled with irrelevant questions, they're less likely to make it past the assessment phase. Potential hires don't want to invest too much time in a position that they may not even be offered. Thus, they may think that a long and stressful assessment is not worth the effort. This can also be problematic for QSRs that create unrealistic requirements and then find that there are no applicants who meet their criteria. One way to trim down on unrealistic assessments and job requirements is to host hiring parties like Taco Bell . Hiring parties allow for face-to-face assessments while increasing convenience for candidates who are able to stop by for a brief introduction. Assessment strategies like hiring parties will help attract more potential employees who are the right fit for your restaurant. You Don't Know What Information Your Hiring Assessment Covers Another big issue that prevents restaurants from attracting the right hires is failing to know what's on their assessments at all. Simply put, if you don't care about the assessment, potential employees won't either. You should familiarize yourself and your team with the core values and expectations that are being communicated in the assessments. The bottom line is that every applicant is going to cost you time and, therefore, money. So, it’s essential that your job assessments weed out the applicants that you don't want and retain the ones that you do. This is especially important in the modern world of online hiring where it has become increasingly common for candidates to opt-out of the job application mid-way through the hiring process. Using the right hiring assessment tools is vital when recruiting your new employees. Workstream helps to relieve some of the stress involved in the hiring process by simplifying and keeping track of applicants, interviews, and onboarding so that your company can save money and time in the long run.

When you factor in a pandemic, which is causing even more unexpected absences and an overall lack of staffing in restaurants than ever before, the discussion about how to best handle overtime is front and center. While paying overtime due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is unavoidable for most QSRs, it’s important for you to identify and prevent unnecessary overtime costs. We know how hard it is to keep a restaurant open during a tight labor shortage—and sometimes paying overtime is the way you’re keeping doors open. But what if you could minimize this extra spend that’s diminishing your profitability? Let’s take a closer look at how overtime is negatively impacting your QSR and four strategies you can use to reduce unplanned overtime. Unplanned overtime hurts There are many different reasons that QSRs pay more overtime than they need to. Common reasons include being short-staffed, mismanaging time-off schedules and even some restaurant cultures that encourage overtime in misguided ways. Regardless of the reason, unnecessary overtime has a negative impact on the financial health of QSRs. For example, once an employee reaches 14 hours of overtime in a week, it becomes less expensive to hire a new employee, even if the new employee is part-time. It’s also important to keep in mind that overtime includes both fixed and variable costs, which is easy to overlook. Thankfully, there are several strategies you can adopt to cut down on overtime. 4 strategies for reducing unplanned overtime Use scheduling software VPs of operations in QSRs are increasingly leveraging scheduling software to align employee schedules with their restaurants’ needs. Scheduling software allows managers to create a best-fit schedule for their teams. Scheduling software allows you to match employee availability, roles and preferences with the specific demands of each of your restaurants. By leveraging powerful scheduling software, you can reduce unplanned overtime and optimize the use of regular hours first. If an open shift needs to be filled, your software can suggest an employee with the least projected overtime for the pay week. Automate the scheduling process Some QSRs continue to use outdated methods of creating, updating and communicating schedules to the team. Luckily, there are many tools on the market today that can do this for you. By automating the scheduling process, you can reduce the time you need to create, update and communicate schedules to your employees. And, by making the scheduling process more efficient, you also enable employees to respond to changes in scheduling quickly—so you can avoid unplanned overtime. Proactively manage employees The ugly truth is that sometimes we underestimate the workload GMs and DMs have on their plates. Their day-to-days are filled with serving customers, coaching teams, hiring new employees, and ordering supplies. You get it. It’s a lot. That’s why it’s important to proactively manage your DMs and GMs workloads. Doing so will also help them avoid burnout and poor performance caused by being overwhelmed. Part of this proactive management is also making sure your managers aren’t facing excessive overtime. Not only can it impact your bottom line, but it can also affect the work-life balance of your best people . Leverage real-time reports and alerts Let’s talk real-time data. If you and your managers had real-time data available through mobile dashboards and alerts to inform you of when there’s a scheduling conflict, imagine how quickly you could address it. Explore tools that can surface this visibility to you and other leaders in your organization—and give restaurants a better chance of filling schedule gaps with available employees without having to pay overtime.

Learning how to work in a professional environment can take career development training, but employees learn valuable skills like customer service , active listening, compliance, cooking skills and more. What if there was a way to accelerate learning and professional development so you could fill your long-term business needs? Creating a mentorship program can future-proof your restaurant and help you hire internally . Many companies avoid mentoring because it takes a lot of work, but around 70% of Fortune 500 companies have mentoring programs in place . Companies who tap into mentoring accelerate their growth and build positive company culture , and this article will help you understand this topic at a high level and create a program of your own. What is mentoring? Why is a mentorship program necessary? Mentoring is a helpful experience that lets younger employees learn from senior staff members. Having good mentors at work provides a lot of benefits for employees. The National Institutes Of Health claims that mentors: Increase employee productivity Create a well-rounded workforce Encourage cross-organizational knowledge sharing And much more Companies that can tap into the benefits of mentoring create many opportunities for their staff members. Mentors can develop naturally as your staff gets to know each other. Organic mentorship isn’t scalable if your organization wants more people to reap the benefits of mentorship at work. Mentorship programs democratize the process of getting a mentor. As we discussed, having a mentor or sponsor can significantly impact workplace outcomes and enhance your employees career goals . According to Insider , “Black women are less likely than their coworkers to have a sponsor.” Underrepresented groups may find it challenging to find a mentor naturally. Programs that match employees to mentors take the guessing game out of finding someone to support and advocate for you at work. How to build a mentorship program for your organization If you are concerned about turning a mentorship program from a vision into a reality, let’s discuss how to build a mentorship program for your team with step by step guide : 1. Define the goals you have for your mentorship program Before you begin creating an employee mentorship program , let’s start by defining the program's goals . What do you want staff members to accomplish? What are your long-term goals as a business ? Perhaps you want to create more mid-level managers at your company, so you could create a program focused on accelerating leadership skills . On the other hand, maybe you have a lot of high school students working with your organization, and you want to provide essential job skills for leadership development , so you create a work skills mentorship program . Ask yourself the following questions as you define your goals: How long do I want the program to last? We suggest that mentorship programs last at least three months so that employees can forge a great bond. How many hours should mentees /mentors devote per week? Ultimately this program should be pretty easy to implement. Setting aside 1-2 hours plus some back and forth via email or text message should be expected. What is the ultimate transformation I want employees to achieve based on the schedule I set? Based on your long-term business goals, set the shift you want to see in employees after their mentorship program ends. Once you understand what you hope to get from an employee mentoring program , you can create the curriculum you want mentors to cover. 2. Create your mentorship program curriculum Mentoring inside an employer-built program isn’t easy. Most programs are rigid, tied to a timeline, etc. The organic workplace advising that leaders do is less structured, and it’s harder to create consistent results with organic mentoring. When you turn an organic relationship into a corporate one, it’s best to have a curriculum defined so that everyone can make the most of their time. As you build a curriculum, consider the following: What do you want your employees to learn? Are there any conversations or activities that will help your team achieve the desired outcome? How much room will you give for the mentor relationship to build? What strategies can you recommend to speed up that process? Is there a prize or an award for people who make it to the end of the mentorship program ? For example, you could give away a stipend or put great mentees in a management accelerator program. Ultimately, a lot of weight will be placed on employees to make sure that everyone gets the most out of their advising experience. 3. Pick the right program participants Once you know what the program will look like, it’s time to find great program participants . It’s important to note that great employees don’t always make great mentors . Teaching and helping isn’t a skill that everyone can master right away due to different learning styles . You have to make sure that every advisor or senior employee you enlist has the skills to help teach new hires or junior employees . On the flip side, some of your employees won’t make great students. You have to pick staff members who are dedicated and excited to improve their work ethic and excel in the program. Which team members would have a great transformation? Are there any employees who have great potential and just need a little extra attention? Pick team members wisely so you have a better retention rate . Lastly, you have to watch and ensure that you put the correct pairs together for better employee development and positive outcomes . Some personalities might clash, so you have to ensure that you connect with the right employees when onboarding for the program. 4. Ensure that mentorship program curriculum is followed After the matching process or enrollment has been completed and the curriculum has been shared, it’s time to make sure that relationships are being forged using the parameters you set. As your employee mentorship program progresses, check in to ensure that: Employees learn the skills they need to Mentors understand the curriculum and teach it effectively As a program manager , your goal is to support both parties going through the program you created. Mentors may need help steering the ship and leading employees. Mentees may need help to best utilize their time with an advisor. 5. Get feedback along the way As your program kicks off, you will likely want to gather feedback or mentoring experience to make sure that the program feels valuable to both mentors and mentees . We suggest providing a survey for feedback after the 1-2 week mark, halfway through, and at the end of the program to measure success and employee satisfaction rate. Once you have this valuable feedback, go through it, organize the major themes and templates of the feedback, and report on your findings. Addressing any major questions or concerns early on can help your team make the most of the program and also help you make a successful mentoring program . If employees want to provide feedback about potential mentors or anything else between your surveys, create an easy way to provide feedback anonymously. If they don’t need anonymity, you could also have employees reach out to you personally. These initiatives and getting feedback quickly will enable you to address program issues before they become serious problems and build a positive mentor- mentee relationship . 6. Make adjustments for the next mentorship program cohort After you run your first program, you need to make adjustments to make the mentoring sessions more efficient and helpful for your team according to the KPIS or metrics you discovered from the feedback. Consider doing a few group meetings with mentors and mentees . Ask questions like: How would you rate the program on a scale of 1-10? Why? Is there any resource that would have made your experience easier or better? What was the biggest challenge you faced during the mentoring program ? What was your biggest takeaway from this mentor training ? Do you think that going through this program enhanced your career? Celebrate: You’ve made an excellent mentorship program It’s time to celebrate. You did the work, and you have created a successful mentorship program experience that your employees will admire for a long time. The work you’ve spent building an advising experience for your team members will have a lasting impact, boost employee engagement , and drive employee tenure. With the right mentoring process , employees can make drastic changes in their work lives. You have helped match mentors and employees who might not otherwise have an advisor to call on. This program will breathe new life into team members who have potential but lack the network to advance. Take some time, and start the effective mentoring program again with more knowledge and renewed passion. New employees need access to the mentorship program you have created.

That’s how many Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in November 2021! It’s a record-breaking number that’s a hard hit on industries that were already struggling with a national labor shortage amid the pandemic . Many managers are wondering how to retain employees, and for good reason. Restaurant turnover rates were high even pre- pandemic . Of the 4.5 million workers who quit in November, 6.1% worked in the hospitality industry. So, in 2023, it’s time for you to face this problem head-on. And we want to help. That’s why, in this article, we’ll be looking at the best ways to retain employees by discussing: Some of the top reasons why restaurant turnover rates are so high Ten employee retention plans to help you keep the employees you already have Let’s get right into it. Why is there a shortage of restaurant workers? The economy is struggling, and yes, the folks who'd usually be serving up your favorite dishes do need jobs. So, what's up with all these \"Help Wanted\" signs and the revolving door of restaurant staff? You might think it's a case of laziness or living off unemployment. No, it's more nuanced than that. Turns out, a lot of people are jumping ship for remote work , looking for better work-life balance and employee perks . Here are some of the top reasons that restaurant turnover rates are so high: Low wages and inadequate benefits Low wages and inadequate benefits have long been a sticking point in the restaurant industry. Even pre- pandemic , there was a clamor for a $15/hour minimum wage, and that noise has only grown louder in the face of economic instability. And let's not even get started on the bare-bones benefits—many fast-food joints don't offer essentials like paid sick leave or health insurance . Here's the kicker: while restaurant folks are fighting for basic healthcare and a living wage, other industries are rolling out the red carpet for top talent . We're talking competitive compensation , flexible schedules , and a whole menu of perks that make it hard for team members to resist jumping ship. From LinkedIn to Forbes , studies are showing that effective employee retention strategies are not just about money; they're about employee engagement , professional development , and a healthy work-life balance . So, it's no wonder employee turnover is high when new hires can find all these incentives in a new job elsewhere. With issues like these, it's not just about resignations ; it's a full-blown attrition crisis. Long working hours Long working hours have become the norm in many eateries, especially with staffing levels at an all-time low. Restaurant workers are clocking in extra hours and pulling double shifts, sometimes out of necessity, other times because there's just no one else. Add to that the extra burden the pandemic went and placed on everyone—like caring for sick family members—and you've got a recipe for burnout . But let's not forget, it's not just about the grind. The lack of work-life balance is a major red flag for top performers seeking new opportunities . Companies that get props on Gallup and LinkedIn offer not just good pay but also initiatives focused on employee well-being and flexible work options . It's a full package deal that prioritizes employee satisfaction and wellness . Stressful work environment The stressful environment in restaurants was further aggravated last year by public reactions to pandemic -related measures like mask mandates and social distancing. Instances of aggressive customers verbally or even physically assaulting workers were unfortunately not uncommon. Many employees understandably reached a breaking point, deciding that the job just wasn't worth it. In contrast, last year saw human resource departments in other industries making strides in elevating employee morale and satisfaction. Mentorship initiatives , team-building activities, and recognition programs became standard practices to retain the best employees . These motivators not only improved the overall employee experience but also positively impacted employee retention rates . Given the challenges of the past, it's hardly surprising that workers are departing restaurants for sectors where their well-being and teamwork are more highly valued. Jobs in different industries The allure of restaurant jobs has significantly waned, prompting workers to explore greener pastures in diverse fields like offices, education, and warehouses, among others. Last year alone, a staggering 15% of hourly workers made the leap to different industries, and another 33% are keen to follow suit. The shift isn't merely about escaping the restaurant scene; it's also about seeking more fulfilling career paths . These alternative sectors often offer structured mentorship programs that help guide new hires and existing staff alike. Moreover, there's a greater focus on upskilling , facilitated by constructive employee feedback . This creates an environment where workers can not only earn a paycheck but also grow professionally, thereby enriching their employment experience. How to retain employees - 10 strategies Given the complexities driving the restaurant labor shortage, doubling down on employee retention isn't just smart, it's essential. Effective retention strategies not only help you keep your current workforce but also make your establishment more attractive to prospective, high-quality employees. So, let's dive into 10 actionable strategies to bolster employee retention in 2023: 1. Increase wages Undoubtedly, higher wages are the top-of-mind desire for most workers at the moment. It's the most concrete way to signal to your team that you appreciate their efforts and want to retain them. While you may not be able to implement across-the-board raises immediately, targeted pay increases for your hardest-working employees can make a significant impact. Here's a tip: consider involving mentors in the process of identifying which team members are truly excelling and deserving of a wage boost. This not only brings experienced perspectives into the decision but also emphasizes the importance of mentorship in your work culture. Also, if you find yourself faced with a departing employee , utilize that opportunity to reassess the compensation structure and understand if wages were a factor in their decision to leave. This can offer invaluable insights for your retention strategies moving forward. 2. Offer better benefits According to a 2019 survey , only 31% of restaurants offered health insurance to their employees. Offering insurance amid a global health crisis would definitely incentivize your workers to stay with you. But health insurance isn’t the only benefit that workers care about. You can also consider offering benefits like paid sick leave, stipends for child care, free meals, cash bonuses or education assistance programs. 3. Show support for mental health Workers in all industries are experiencing burnout right now. Your employees are no exception. So, acknowledge the stress they’re under. Expose them to free or affordable mental health resources . Encourage breaks and transparency about what parts of the job are most mentally taxing. These things won’t erase the problems your employees face. But they will show them that you care. 4. How to retain employees through flexible pay schedules You’re now competing with the gig economy where workers can make and receive their money fast. To keep up, consider adopting technology like Tapcheck that allows employees to gain access to their earnings whenever they want. According to Tapcheck, giving your workers the option for on-demand pay can also lead to increased productivity, lower HR expenses and a boost in company profits. 5. Create a safe workplace In 2023, the emphasis has shifted from pandemic -specific measures to overall safety and well-being . Your employees need to feel safe and respected to continue working for you. Implement training programs that address conflict resolution and educate your team on how to manage difficult or unruly customers. If difficult customers are a frequent issue, consider hiring a security guard or installing surveillance systems to add an extra layer of safety. Signage can also be used to remind customers of policies that protect both them and the staff, such as a zero-tolerance policy on harassment or violence. By taking these steps, you can create an environment that respects the dignity and safety of your employees. 6. Show appreciation In challenging times within the service industry, showing genuine appreciation for your employees stands out as one of the best ways to retain employees. Knowing they are valued for their hard work can be the decisive factor that motivates staff to endure hardships and stay committed to their roles. Publicly acknowledging your employees' contributions not only reinforces their significance to your organization but also serves as a morale booster for the entire team. While financial incentives like bonuses and raises are impactful, never underestimate the power of personalized gestures like a handwritten thank you card. These acts can often make a lasting impression, emphasizing that you genuinely care for and appreciate your team. 7. How to retain employees through strong company culture Company culture plays an important role in keeping employees engaged at work. On top of that, a strong company culture can lead to increased productivity and overall job satisfaction . You can build a strong culture among workers by offering career development opportunities , regularly asking for feedback, and improving communication between management and staff. 8. Reassess your onboarding process Your onboarding process can have a long-lasting impact on newly hired employees’ job performance and retention. In fact, according to one report, an efficient onboarding process can increase the retention rate by 82% . So, after you’ve implemented the above strategies to retain your current employees , take time to also improve your onboarding process . Look for ways to ensure your workers achieve early success and feel confident in their roles. 9. Improve your hiring process You won’t have to worry as much about new employees quitting if you’re clear on expectations and effectively assess cultural fit during the hiring process. Doing so will help you filter out applicants who don’t show potential to stay with you long-term. But how can you achieve this? By being transparent about things like work responsibilities, compensation, and other benefits during the application and interview process. You should also make sure you’re asking restaurant interview questions that are relevant to your restaurant’s current working conditions. 10. Identify the root causes during exit interviews When employees do quit, take advantage of the opportunity to find out the reasons why by strategically conducting exit interviews . Of course, it may be too late to retain employees at this stage. But you can use the information you learn during these interviews to make relevant improvements for the employees that stay. How to retain employees - final thoughts Right now, there’s no way to know how long the restaurant labor shortage will last. But by proactively improving your retention strategies, you can reduce your turnover rate and avoid later being short-staffed. Try out the 10 tips we’ve shared in this post: Increase wages Offer better benefits Show support for mental health Offer flexible pay schedules Create a safe workplace Show appreciation Strengthen the company culture Reassess your onboarding process Improve your hiring process Identify the root causes during exit interviews And for more tips like these, be sure to also check out our recent posts on how to run a restaurant after the Covid-19 pandemic .

When hiring a replacement , companies need to incur turnover costs , including costs of hiring, onboarding, lower productivity, and errors committed by new employees due to lack of familiarity. Another forgotten cost is social capital. On average, losing an employee can cost up to 200% of their annual pay, depending on their role. The aggregated expense incurred from turnover rates is huge. Bearing that in mind, companies must attract the right candidates who will not abruptly leave their company. A clearly written and well-thought-out job posting can help you attract the right candidates . In today's competitive job market, it's essential to make a strong first impression with your job advertisement . But in a sea of job postings across different job boards , how do you make sure that yours is seen? Here's how to write a job posting that attracts the right talent. How to Create a Job Posting ? A well-crafted posting on your company website can attract the best talent by highlighting required skills , and preferred qualifications . Also, the benefits of working with your team and team members , such as health insurance and remote work opportunities. Let’s look into how you should write a job advertisement or posting - Write a compelling introduction If you're asking yourself how to write a job posting ,  a catchy job title isn’t enough. You need to have a compelling introduction as well. It’s important to directly address the reader. You want to entice potential applicants with a glimpse into the exciting opportunities your job opening presents. Share details about your role and the requirements of your ideal candidate . The best introductions are 2-3 sentences long, concise, and appeal directly to the audience. If your role offers something unique, call it out here. Depending on the culture and environment of your organization, you may also choose to vary the tone. For example, if you're hiring for a quick-service restaurant (QSR), you can decide to adopt a formal, professional approach, or embrace more casual language and fun punctuation to highlight your team’s personality. Start by giving readers a video about your company and open job role. Avoid terms such as “help us,” “work for us,” etc. This puts a hierarchical gap between prospective job candidates and the company. Opt for positive terms like, “join our fun, high-energy team\" in the job description . Then, give a summary of what the role entails and the value it adds to your organization. This is where storytelling comes in handy, which can help in making the post stand out. For example, \"As a crew member on our team, you will serve as a brand ambassador through every interaction with our customers. Welcome them in and help them feel that we are here to make this moment in time a little lighter for them.” If you’re unsure about what to include in your job description , consider speaking to someone familiar with the role to get a sense of what they do daily. Ask them about what they enjoy about their job, who they collaborate with, or what makes them good at their job. In crafting a compelling introduction for your job posting , it's crucial to consider the candidate's experience . Weave these insights into an interesting storyline to make your posting more attractive and relatable. Tell job seekers who you are When learning how to write a job post , you'll realize not all candidates will know a lot about your restaurant, and your job listing provides a great opportunity to share more information with them. Use this space to tell them why they want to work for your organization. This is not the standard “ about us ” boilerplate you list on your website. Instead, tailor this description to your job posting . Hourly employees aren’t interested in when your company was founded, or how many clients you have. They want to know what makes you a great employer. For instance, rather than pointing out what your business does in general, you can share about the team culture and how your employees have grown and benefited from it. Here are some questions you can use to guide you in crafting a simple paragraph to tell job seekers who you are: What products do you sell / what type of services do you provide? Why are you looking for hourly employees? What are your niche areas? What makes your company stand out from the competition? What are your goals and how will hiring hourly employees help you achieve them? Be transparent about job requirements The next part to focus on is the job requirements . Don't use catchy phrases for job postings . instead, be clear bout the work experience , skills, other accreditations and certifications, or languages and experiences needed. It’s crucial to be transparent, because not only does it help you avoid a messy lawsuit, but it will also attract the right candidate for the role, thus preventing misfits. Be specific about the experience level you're seeking. Turn towards sentences such as “at least 2 years experience as a waiter/waitress” or “2 or more years of experience in package delivery with a valid driver’s license and an acceptable motor vehicle record per our specific standards.” If your company has very specific hiring standards, be transparent about this and add these qualification requirements here. While this may narrow down the pool of job candidates, it will save time in looking through job applications that do not meet the cut. The last thing you'll want to face is wasting an hour of your time interviewing a candidate who does not meet the minimum requirements. Remember to include the working hours here as well. Indicate if job seekers would have a choice to pick their schedule if it will be allocated, and if the job is a full-time or a part-time role. Consider the use of smart screening questions in your application process , which can save more time by automatically filtering and rejecting applicants who do not meet certain criteria. This feature may also be offered on some job boards . For example, someone who indicates that they only have 2 years of experience will automatically be rejected for a role that requires a minimum of 4 years of experience . List the preferred formal qualifications Most applicants would have some sort of formal qualification, be it college or industry certification. It’s not always necessary to list formal education as a requirement, but it will be a bonus if the job position that you are trying to fill requires some of the skills and knowledge that come with a formal education. Keep this section short. Emphasize that these formal qualifications are not essential but are a bonus. This way, you will be able to tap into the diverse workforce and increase your chances of hiring people with both experience and qualifications . Let them know about your expectations Employees will only be able to perform well after knowing what’s expected of them. The job description lays the foundation for such expectations, and this is a crucial element that should not be missed. You would not want to sit through the entire process of interviewing and onboarding an applicant only to have them quit on the first day because they realized that the job wasn’t what they signed up for. As a hiring manager , it’s vital to know everything related to the job position you are hiring for. You should include the daily obligations, who they'll be reporting to, and how they can expect communication across and within team functions. Being upfront with your expectations helps candidates determine whether they can deliver what is expected of them and whether the job is in line with what they wish to pursue. Reasons for applying to your company A job posting conveys two messages: what you expect from job candidates and what job candidates can expect from you. Provide them with reasons why they should apply for a job with your company instead of another. This is where you can mention the work environment, learning opportunities, and even company benefits. If the potential candidate can have a chance to work with an experienced team, do share in this section how you can provide them with professional growth and development with the help of a mentor. You may also share your company's reward system or benefits package that helps incentivize potential employees. Providing benefits to your hourly employees sends a message that your company cares about their well-being and appreciates the work that each employee puts in. Highlight benefits that may be unique to your organization , as these will likely be the pull factor in attracting a candidate and are what will set you apart from your competitors. For example, a McDonald's in Florida was paying people $50 to show up for a job interview. Such a perk would draw more candidates to apply for the role and should be included in the job posting . Explain communication expectations Whether you’re hiring a cook or a cashier, you’ll benefit from clearly detailing the expectations on day-to-day communication. This will help you and the candidate align on expectations and working styles. Limit this section to just a sentence or two. Establishing clear guidelines will be important. You’ll want to make sure, for example, that your customer-facing employees know that they’ll be expected to speak with customers. For some candidates, this might be a commitment they’re unwilling to make. Maybe they’re shy. Maybe there’s a language barrier. Giving them the chance to whether or not they can agree to the role’s requirements up front will save you and the candidate time. State the hourly pay The most important piece of information to every employee is the hourly pay. Even if you have the perfect job posting with tons of viewers, you risk losing their interest if you do not include the monetary compensation. Unlike a full-time job posting that includes a year’s salary figure, an hourly employee’s pay states a figure by the hour. You can also state the period for which you are planning to hire the hourly employee and add either weekly or monthly remuneration for the job position . Highlighting a competitive salary range and using bullet points to outline key responsibilities can help draw attention to the position. Leave your contact details Include a company email address or phone number for applicants to contact you in the event that they have further questions about the role. This also shows that your company is willing to offer help if they need it. Revisit your job posting After writing the first draft of your job posting , review it and trim it to make it as concise as possible. Job seekers have a short attention span and you don’t want to miss out on candidates because your post is lengthy. This is especially so in the mobile-first era. As a rule of thumb, make sure that your job posting fits within two scrolls of a mobile phone. Another tip is to arrange your content in a logical order. This is why many job postings start with the benefits to entice job seekers before proceeding to the requirements of the job. Ensure that your job ad is easy to read. Use bullet points when sharing benefits, requirements , and opportunities for advancement. Lastly, ensuring your job advertisement is free of typos demonstrates professionalism and attention to detail, leaving a positive first impression on candidates.

No matter the industry or the type of job you’re actively recruiting for a poorly written job description can mean that your current vacancy falls on deaf ears. But with the help of professional job posting templates , you can easily learn how to craft an impactful job description designed to attract top talent . So, grab yourself a coffee and let’s get into the key elements to include when putting together a job ad . What Is A Job Posting & Why It Needs To Be Structured Well Have you ever heard that quote from Steve Martin , be so good that they can’t ignore you? While it does apply to those looking to secure their first job opportunity, it can also apply to hiring managers . A job opportunity needs to position the company in the best possible light, accurately reflect the day-to-day duties, and encourage hopeful candidates to apply. But this isn’t always as easy as it sounds. A solid job posting template should be easy to customize , guide hiring managers and recruiters on what to include within the body of the job listing and where to share the opportunity once it goes live. Because what’s the point of a well-written job description if it fails to get in front of the right type of candidate? Key Elements For A Professional Job Description So, let’s talk about the key elements you should include in a professional job description ; Salary Expectation: Being transparent in your job description is going to make it far easier to find the right candidates to interview. As Christian Sutherland-Wong, Glassdoor Chief Executive Officer, explains, “Every company should be embracing pay transparency. By removing salary secrecy, employers can address potential pay gaps and ensure equal pay for equal work. Salary transparency empowers job seekers and employees to understand better what fair pay looks like for their experience and skills. In addition, employers see the benefits of a more productive and engaged workforce.” So always include the salary range as well as any bonuses that may be offered. Experience & Skillset Required: Where it might be tempting to add ‘degree required’ to your job listing , first really consider whether the role really needs this. These days candidates may have a wealth of experience but not necessarily a degree. A candidate with experience has skills , training and knowledge that could result in an easy transition into their new role. They may be able to start work faster with no need for lengthy training. So if you’re looking for someone who can hit the ground running over new hires who requires training and in-depth onboarding then ditch the degree requirement and focus on years of experience and skillset within the job listing instead. Ideally, use bullet points to clearly show the criteria and skills required from potential candidates . Company culture : From autonomous to agile, what word best describes your work culture ? Choosing the right words here can be the difference between a hire staff turnover rate and long-standing employees. Candidates want to know what it's like to work for your company, so refrain from using ‘family’ in 2023 and use terminology such as collaborative, innovative, empathetic, motivating and inclusive. But only if these terms really do apply to your team’s dynamic. Job Perks : Another key element to include is job perks . In fact, this can be a major selling point for candidates. Apart from salary, perks such as flexible work arrangements, professional development opportunities, free gym memberships and a unique office environment can help attract candidates who are looking to join a company that has grand plans and exciting incentives. Career Development Opportunities: Ambitious new hires will want to know that by joining your team, there is room to grow, so make sure to mention career development opportunities in a job ad . Things such as training programs or mentorship opportunities are all exciting prospects that should help encourage candidates with drive and future vision to apply for your new opening. FAQs : You should also consider including an FAQ section that helps candidates understand whether they’re a good fit, what the role requires and what to expect by working for the company name . Sample Job Post Now let’s look at a possible sample job post to give you an idea of how you can easily incorporate all of the above elements into a job posting template for hiring managers to use. Role: (name the job title ) Company: (add the company name and the industry it falls within) Salary Expectation: (List the base line salary for the role and what you would be willing to pay for a candidate with the ideal criteria and skillset) Location: (Name the office location or whether the role is hybrid, 100% remote or virtual) Job Perks : (Include any perks such as a free gym membership, flexible working hours, Wednesday Pizza day etc) Company Culture : (Describe the company culture as best you can within three words) What We’re Looking For: (Describe the ideal candidate based on skills, drive, and level of experience but don’t get personal) Invest In Your Future Career: (Explain how the right candidate would benefit from joining the company in regard to career development) Always include clear next steps in any job posting template , such as contact information to send over a resume and cover letter , such as ‘To apply, please forward your resume or CV to (email address)’. This is the ‘ call to action ’ all job description templates need to secure job applications . There you have it, a well-crafted job posting template that hiring managers can easily use to put together a professional and effective job description .

I’m Greg Reheis, I’m Vice President of Operations for 13th Floor Pilot. Cinnabon itself started at around 1985 by two restauranteurs up in the Seattle area. They set out to create the best cinnamon roll they could, and they did a pretty good job. When we were first approached by Workstream, we have had so many changes within the organization that I was very reluctant to even consider it. But I politely agreed to go into the call, fully intending to just dismiss it. During the conversation though, there were a couple of points that really started to make me really listen carefully. The first one was that an applicant could simply text in their application on their phones . This to me was a big selling point. At that point, I really started to really listen to what was being presented to us. And I saw a number of real possibilities for us. I placed an ad at 8 o’clock on one night, by 8 o’clock the next morning, I had 34 applicants. And in two days time, we had eight brand new hires in the store. My name is Kyra Ortega and I’m the HR Manager for 13th Floor Pilot. Workstream efficiently served their role of being an automated hiring and on-boarding platform . Not only is Workstream user friendly , they are also great for setting up calendars, blocks of windows for interview times, which used to be a manual and tedious process . Workstream also allows for easy communication between us and the applicant via text messages. It is easier for the employers and applicants to schedule, reschedule and cancel interview. We definitely benefitted greatly from this communication process. Workstream offers internal quizzes based on a personalized metrics of our choice and this helps to automatically filter through the file of applicants. With that, only the best qualified applicants will be sent to us. TAGS Recruiting strategies Desirene Neo Psychology and Marketing graduate, B2B Marketing enthusiast and avid pet lover.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 04/04/23 4 proven ways to turn applicants into new hires Share this article In today’s hiring landscape, two things are key throughout the process: speed and engagement. We’ve seen businesses that invest in how fast and how well they communicate with applicants reap lasting hiring rewards. To help explain how we compiled data from actual Workstream customers. Here are our findings—along with some of our recommendations—for sourcing, communication, screening, and scheduling best practices you can use to hire hourly workers faster. Why speed matters Research shows that hourly workers typically apply to several jobs at once—often up to eight at the same time. Which job an applicant pursues can ultimately come down to which employer reaches out first and gets them through the hiring process to a job offer faster. When you take your time and hesitate to respond, you run the risk of giving applicants the opportunity to move on. Why engagement matters Hourly workers want to be treated with respect and feel like potential employers see them as a person—not like someone disposable or easily replaceable. This can be as simple as following up with them in a timely manner, knowing their name, or getting familiar with their background. And that starts with how you engage with people from the moment they apply. Although many communication touchpoints are automated, it’s still up to you to give things your personal touch. How speed and engagement work together Being able to get your open positions filled in a timely manner with the best applicants available is the ultimate goal for most hiring managers, people leaders, and business owners. By working on speed and engagement, you’ll see positive results in your organization’s hiring performance—especially if you have HR technology to streamline the process from start to finish. To offer you a more in-depth understanding, we compiled data from customers to show how real businesses and hiring managers balance speed and engagement to turn applicants into new hires faster. Sourcing For many hiring managers or business owners, sourcing applicants can seem daunting and tedious at first. But when approached with a fresh perspective and a little imagination, it can become a fun and effective way to set yourself apart from other employers and attract a wider range of applicants. Most employers go directly to online job boards when posting an open position. Though helpful for finding applicants quickly, job boards are slowly becoming a thing of the past. They’re lazy in nature and not always effective in finding qualified candidates or getting the engagement you need. For many job board applicants, quantity is more important than quality. Which means that they’ll apply to several jobs at once, hoping it increases their odds of getting hired. In the process, they become less selective (or invested) in each job. And worse, not really a fit for your opportunity. Instead of a job-board-only strategy, consider more effective active sourcing tools to convert more of your applicants to hires, specifically text-to-apply, referrals, and social media. Text-to-apply Our data shows that text-to-apply is 5x more effective than job boards at sourcing new hires. Why? For a potential applicant to see (and respond) to a text-to-apply opportunity, it’s more than likely that they’re already engaging with your brand and are a frequent visitor to your business. If they like your company enough to take the next step and choose to work for you, why miss out? You’ll find that text-to-apply candidates are more likely to be committed to (and motivated about) your particular opportunity versus another job post they found randomly in an online search. With this in mind, prominently display text-to-apply posters and table tents within your business. The same goes for signage in your community and online for those following your brand. Taking the initiative to source from your existing customers for job applicants demonstrates that you’re an engaging, discerning employer that appreciates its fan base and takes the extra step to capture their attention. Plus, you benefit by recruiting people familiar with your business. Referrals Our data shows referrals are 8.7x more effective than job boards at sourcing new hires. It comes as no surprise that word of mouth is among the most powerful recruiting tools. Really, what better way to find your next hire than through the connection (or endorsement) of existing team members who already love working for your business? Selecting applicants from your employees' friends and family networks gives you a big advantage no job board offers: Instant credibility and trust in the form of someone who can personally vouch for your business. It also answers the question most applicants wonder: “What’s it really like to work here?” By setting up a formal employee referral program , you can also increase engagement with your current staff. Adding incentives, rewards, or bonuses for referrals not only encourages employee participation—it’s a way to give back to your team, show you care, and get to know them better. Social media Our custom data shows social media is 2.8x more effective than job boards at sourcing new hires. As alluded to earlier, social media is an ideal resource to access job applicants who are familiar with your brand and have a positive opinion about your business. Promoting open roles on your social channels creates a direct path for an interested fan to become someone intent on working for your business. Maximize your chances of success with social media sourcing by developing (or bolstering) your existing social media strategy. Creating engaging content about your brand (and don’t worry, you don’t have to do all the work ) is a great way to expose your company to a wider audience and expand beyond your in-person audience. Check out some quick tips for social sourcing in the video below. Sourcing is a crucial step in the applicants’ journey, so make it count. Don’t abandon job boards entirely, but know that other sourcing tools increase engagement and are more likely to convert. Communication As mentioned before, the average hourly worker looking for a new job opportunity will apply to up to eight jobs at the same time. As an employer in this environment, it becomes a race for who gets to those applicants first. Once you gain an edge in sourcing, communication is next. If you’re looking for a simple yet effective competitive advantage, remember how quickly you engage applicants makes a big difference. Our data shows that you have a 2.4x greater chance of a successful hire if you proactively contact the applicant before they can contact you. On top of that, the chance of hiring becomes 25% greater if you contact candidates within an hour of receiving their applications. But how realistic is this response time in practice? Using technology like Workstream , you can send automated messages at key touchpoints like this. Of course, having automation in place doesn’t mean you can be 100% hands-off at hiring. Plan on adding some personality to your communication to show it’s not just a robotic process. Your communication strategy with new applicants could look something like this: You get notified once a new applicant enters the system through the Workstream app. Simultaneously, your applicant receives an automated “Thanks for applying” message. Now, quickly pull up their application in the app and scan through it to find something fun or unique. Maybe you noticed that they applied through an in-store text-to-apply poster. Send the applicant a text like “Got your application. Thanks for visiting our store today.” Reaching out to applicants with a personalized message within the first hour is just as easy as that. Whether you mention them by name, acknowledge their most recent job’s relevance to the open position, or bring up the employee they used as a reference, adding a human touch works. It also proves you’re an employer committed to improving the worker experience—and willing to bring that approach to new applicants and potential employees. Screening Using smart screening questions makes it possible to hire job applicants on the same day as their interview. Once you set up your automatic screening process, you can access the most qualified candidates faster—while saving yourself time otherwise spent going over applications manually. Screening questions should be relevant to the specific job opening and incorporated into your online application process—advancing applicants to the next step based on their responses. Here are a few of the questions actual Workstream customers use to screen applicants: Do you have a driver’s license? Are you at least 18 years old? Do you have previous management experience? So, what’s the advantage of using smart screening questions to advance applicants faster? You get to your qualified applicants faster—complete with a 2.4x greater chance of a successful hire which includes a 25% greater chance of hiring those candidates if you contact them within an hour after they applied. Overall the sooner you can speak to a qualified applicant, the sooner you can engage them—allowing them to move on to the next hiring stage sooner than usual. No one likes to wait around for an employer to get back to them. With solutions like Workstream and its screening capabilities, your applicants no longer have to—giving you a clear advantage. Scheduling The interview scheduling process can be painful for hiring managers and job applicants alike. It typically takes several back-and-forth messages and conversations to settle on a date and time that works for all parties involved. The longer it takes, the easier it becomes to lose momentum—and for your good applicants to become frustrated and discouraged about their experience with you. Conversely, the sooner you can bring those applicants in for an interview, the more likely they are to become new hires. This is not only because you’ve helped your applicants avoid the drawn-out process of getting to the interview. It’s also due to the great impression you make. With Workstream, you can differentiate your business by allowing applicants to schedule interview times for themselves—all based on the predetermined availability you set up in the system. We’ve seen applicants self-schedule interviews in as little as 60 seconds entirely on their phones. Besides cutting down on time and the annoyance, our customer data shows that: Applicants are 2.6x more likely to accept an offer when they can schedule their interview immediately—likely because they appreciate the extra effort given to make things easier. Employers have a 16% greater chance of a successful hire when applicants interview the same week they apply. It all goes back to meeting those qualified applicants sooner. Besides getting your applicants in for an interview before other employers competing for their attention, providing a fun and engaging interview experience can also secure a hire. Getting interviews scheduled sooner and candidates hired faster gives you the edge you need in a competitive job market—allowing you to hire workers you’d otherwise lose to other employers. Make the most of your time and effort You don’t have to sacrifice speed for good engagement or good engagement for speed. Finding a healthy balance of both will help your business institute a more effective and positive applicant experience—one that’s proven to get more hires and differentiate you from other employers.

They make up approximately 60% of the entire workforce. The annual churn rate for hourly workers is 49% , meaning half of your hourly staff likely churns every single year . Thus it's no surprise that many hiring managers feel like they’re constantly in interview mode. The problem with interviews is that they require a lot of context-switching, which can eat up 80% of your productive time. They also require cross-team coordination and quick follow-up. You need to get back to applicants quickly, before they get scooped up by one of your competitors. In this article, we've compiled 4 quick hacks to help organize your interview schedule so you can stay focused on what matters most. Set up a monthly view of your calendar This will help you get a sense of whether you have enough candidates coming in to compensate for the inevitable churn. View our Sample Interview Schedule for reference when creating your own. Add details from the weekly view Zoom into a specific week when you need to include more interview details. By creating a single tab for each week, you reduce the clutter of information on a single screen. Set interview time slots broken down into 30 minutes intervals (or any duration of your choice) from the weekly view. If candidates need to interview with multiple people, you can slot them next to each other. Write interview instructions and candidate comments in the calendar The calendar comments function is a great way to share special instructions and accompanying documents with your team. For example, you can remind a hiring manager to ask for references, or attach references previously collected. The comments function can also be used to send additional reminders to your interviewer. Let them know how many candidates they are meeting in a given day by tagging them in the comments section. Integrate your personal calendar The Sample Interview Schedule is free to download and a great place to start, but it still requires a lot of back and forth to schedule and confirm time slots. That’s one of the reasons we built Workstream - you can sync the interview schedule with your personal calendar. We automate the process for applicants to schedule time on your schedule, and nudge them to confirm. Interested in learning more? Schedule a demo !

Behavioral questions are some of the most effective ways of assessing if a candidate is a good fit for your position and your company's culture. Your goal is to uncover how they handled past work situations. This serves as a good litmus test and can help with the decisions around who to hire or not. How to assess answers to behavioral questions This has been an age-old question for many interviewers, especially less-experienced hiring managers. After all, candidates have varied experiences and answers. With the top 10 behavioral interview questions, how do you objectively assess the answers and compare them across different candidates? Unfortunately, there isn’t a definitive answer. Many interviewers we’ve worked with still base their selection process on ‘gut feeling’ and intuition. And that’s perfectly fine. Some nuances and idiosyncrasies cannot easily be quantified by a metric. That’s where the art of interviewing and being perceptive often comes in. Nonetheless,when asking the top 10 behavioral interview questions, many interviewers opt to use a metric scale, the most popular of which is the Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS). BARS compares an individual’s performance levels to specific examples of behavior that are anchored to numerical ratings. A simple range of performance levels could be: Unacceptable, Acceptable, and Exceptional OR Below Expectations, Meets Expectations, Exceeds Expectations. Based on a scale of 1-7, you can then assign a score depending on their answer. Let’s see this in action. Top 10 behavioral interview questions to ask candidates We’ve added our proposed metrics to help you assess possible answers to each of the identified best interview questions to ask candidates. Feel free to augment them based on the answers you’re looking for. As a general rule of thumb, the highest points are often awarded if the candidate gives a satisfactory response based on the STAR method of answering these interview questions. Question 1: Describe a time when you were a team player on a project or initiative. What was your role, and how did you contribute to the team in that role? Competency: Teamwork and communication Question 2: Describe a time when you handled a difficult situation. Competency: Problem solving Question 3: Describe a time when you made a mistake and what you did to correct it. Competency: Problem solving and accountability Question 4: Can you tell me about a time when you had to deal with an irate customer or client? Competency: Interpersonal awareness and customer orientation Question 5: Describe a time when you were in conflict with a co-worker and how you resolved the situation. Competency: Communication and conflict resolution Question 6: Have you ever disagreed with a manager or superior? How did you resolve it? Competency: Interpersonal awareness, problem-solving, and flexibility Question 7: Describe a time when you set a goal. How did you achieve it? Competency: Establishing focus and determination Question 8: Describe a time when you did not have sufficient time to complete your work. What did you do? Competency: Decisiveness and analytical Thinking Question 9: Describe a time when your team was undergoing change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt? Competency: Managing Change Question 10: Tell me about a time you were dissatisfied with your work. What could have been done to make it better? Competency: Critical self-reflection While behavioral questions aren’t the only type of interview questions to ask candidates, they're undoubtedly one of the most effective.

No matter the role, recruiters are always on the lookout for the best of the best. Ultimately, companies want employees that will stay for a long time and be loyal to their brand. You've posted your job listings on countless job boards (possibly 25,000 with a single click, if you use job board integrations ), went through internal screening and interviews , and finally decided that this is the candidate you want. Now what? The most exciting part of the hiring process is likely the moment where you tell a candidate that they have made it through the interview(s) and are deemed the right fit for your company.  This is often communicated through a letter (or email), more commonly known as a job offer letter. This letter should be succinct, to the point, and informative. There are two main sections in a job offer letter: (1) a reiteration of the job description  (2) the employee benefits they can expect, inclusive of their salary what the new hire gets in case they decide to accept the offer. The way this letter is written letter is crucial because it determines whether the candidate eventually takes up your offer. The Offer Letter Isn't Mandatory but It Gives Results As an employer, you have no obligation to send such letters to hire new candidates – it's nothing more than a simple formality. By doing so, you're reinforcing (thus providing more legitimacy to) the verbal offer, and showing a little sign of goodwill by making it official. It's an excellent way to highlight the newly established relationship between you and the candidate and to make a strong impression. However, prior to the offer letter,  it's best to make a verbal offer to preface the situation and give the candidate a heads up before confirming it with a job offer letter. It would be unappealing and unprofessional to just inform your new hire that they have been offered the job only via email. Furthermore, you could also run a risk of the candidate accepting another offer in the time it takes to prepare and send out the offer letter. In this case, we recommend a physical letter, or at least a formal document attached to the email, as it will add an air of professionalism to the entire situation. Important Things to Cover in a Job Offer Letter The way the offer letter is written is important, as your new hire needs to clearly understand the terms offered and what they can expect when they take up a job in your company. This is where defining the role and job scope comes in handy. With that in mind, here are some important things that your job offer letter should cover. Job title Define the role by stating the job title, with a short description of what you expect from your new hire. This should be in line with the job description uploaded on job boards, reflecting any changes that were brought up during the interview. Compensation Every employee wants to know how much they will be compensated paid for their work. In this section, you need to be very specific about their salary on both the annual (if relevant) and hourly level . The latter is extremely important, especially when you're recruiting new hires for your QSR, as they are likely to be paid on an hourly basis. Additionally, you should also be clear about commissions, bonuses, and any other wage-related benefits your organization may have. Try to describe in detail the payment process and structure. Your chances of hiring a quality employee greatly increase if you're specific about this aspect, and your employees will definitely appreciate it if you explain their pay, down to the tiniest details. Additionally, being specific also helps you avoid unnecessary complications and misunderstandings. You can also decide to honor the 10 percent rule, as your new candidates will appreciate that their new paycheck is 10 percent higher than before. However, these should all have been discussed during the negotiation for pay, with the final amount reflected in the offer letter. Pay schedule Another crucial part of your offer letter is the pay schedule. Be clear and specific about how often your employees will get paid and the exact amount they can expect. Go into details about the benefits If you're giving any benefits, and it's highly recommended that you do, be specific about them too. Transparency is a sign of being legitimate and honest, which your employees appreciate. Detail all the benefits and how they can utilize them. Schedule A working schedule and opening hours are mandatory as well. Every employee wants to know their schedule upfront so that they can organize their time. A weekly schedule, restaurant location, and the start date of their employment would suffice. This is also a section where you should cover logistics, the details about the expiration of the offer, who the manager and contact person for any questions will be, and so on. Use a formal but cheerful tone You don't want to intimidate your employees, you want to support and acknowledge them. You can accomplish this easily by being formal but cheerful at the same time. Express how the candidate will be a great addition to your team, to make them feel welcome. After all, this is an exciting time for both parties. Convey that to your new hire by emphasizing how important they are to you and your brand. Make them feel wanted and you'll win them over. Simplify the process with Workstream Did you know that with Workstream, you can even send an automatic notification to applicants when their stage is set to \"hired\"? They will be alerted with a link to their offer letters, HR documents, W-4s, and more. Use job offer letter templates, collect and store electronic signatures or even trigger alerts if paperwork is incomplete, to make the onboarding process an even more seamless one. Follow the above steps and you would've done what you can. Once the offer letter has been sent over, the final decision is in their hands, and you're one step closer to a new addition to your team! Even when they send in their signed offer letter, it is just the beginning! Remember to follow up with mobile training , utilize payroll platforms for improved efficiency and preserve all HR documents for future use. There are many more things you can do to make the recruiting and onboarding process a painless and fuss-free one, for both the recruiters and the candidates! Schedule a chat with us to find out more.

An engaged workforce will lead to a strong company culture, low turnover and fantastic results, while a disengaged workforce can easily lead to the exact opposite. In this guide, we will explore the importance of employee engagement, how to assess and measure it, and strategies for improving it. Why Does Employee Engagement Matter? Employee engagement is more than just a buzzword – it has a real impact on the success of a business. When employees are engaged, they are more motivated, productive, and committed to their work. This leads to a range of benefits for the organization, including: Increased productivity : Engaged employees are more likely to go above and beyond in their work, resulting in higher productivity and better business outcomes. Improved retention : Engaged employees are less likely to leave their jobs, which can save a company money and resources on recruitment and training. Enhanced customer satisfaction : When employees are engaged, they are more likely to provide better customer service, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Better financial performance : Companies with high levels of employee engagement tend to have better financial performance, as engaged employees contribute to increased productivity and profitability. To put it even more simply, employee engagement matters because it has a direct impact on the success and competitiveness of a business. By prioritizing engagement and creating a positive work environment, businesses can drive better outcomes and create a sustainable competitive advantage. Engaged Workers vs Disengaged Workers Many employers find it difficult to accurately assess just how much of a difference an engaged worker can have for their business over a disengaged worker. This table should provide clarity on this issue: Engaged Workers Disengaged Workers Highly motivated and committed to their work Lack motivation and commitment to their work Efficient and productive in their role Less productive and may require more supervision Regular attendance and low absenteeism Higher absenteeism and may call out sick more frequently Produce high quality work that meets or exceeds expectations Produce lower quality work that may not meet expectations Positive attitude towards their work and the organization Negative attitude towards their work and the organization Adaptable to change and open to new ideas Resistant to change and less likely to embrace new ideas Loyal to the organization and invested in its success May consider leaving their job or less invested in the success of the company Engage in continuous learning and development May not prioritize learning and development Actively participate in company events and culture May be less involved in company events and culture Willing to go above and beyond in their role Less likely to go above and beyond in their role What's the Difference Between Employee Engagement and the Employee Experience? Employee engagement and the employee experience are related, but ultimately distinct concepts. Employee engagement refers to the level of commitment, motivation, and connection that employees feel towards their work and their organization. It is a measure of how invested an employee is in their work and how likely they are to go above and beyond in their role. On the other hand, the employee experience refers to the overall experience of being an employee at a company, including factors such as the work environment, culture, leadership, and development opportunities. It encompasses all aspects of an employee's time with a company, from the onboarding process to their daily work tasks to their interactions with colleagues and leadership. While employee engagement is an important part of the employee experience, it is just one aspect of it. Other factors, such as work-life balance, growth and development opportunities, and the overall work culture, can also impact the employee experience. In short, employee engagement is a measure of an employee's connection to their work and their organization, while the employee experience is a broader concept that encompasses all aspects of an employee's time with a company. Both are important for the success and satisfaction of employees, and businesses should strive to optimize both to create a positive and supportive work environment. Whose job is it to worry about employee engagement? Management plays a particularly important role in shaping the level of employee engagement within an organization. Leaders set the tone for the company culture and can inspire and motivate employees through their actions and words. They should be open to feedback and ideas, and be willing to listen and address the concerns of their team members. In addition to management, it is important for all employees to take ownership of their own engagement and be proactive in finding ways to stay motivated and connected to their work. This might involve setting personal goals, seeking out new challenges and learning opportunities, and actively participating in company culture and events. Ultimately, employee engagement is a shared responsibility and requires the involvement and commitment of all team members. By working together and creating a positive and supportive work environment, businesses can improve employee engagement and drive better outcomes for all. Assessing Employee Engagement Measuring your current employee engagement level is perhaps the most important early step in improving it. There are a number of ways to assess employee engagement, including surveys, focus groups, and one-on-one conversations with employees. Common employee engagement survey questions might include: How motivated are you to perform your job well? How invested are you in the success of the company? How well do you understand the goals and objectives of the company? Do you feel that your work is meaningful and impactful? How well do you feel your skills and talents are utilized in your role? Do you feel that you have the support and resources you need to be successful in your job? Do you feel that your contributions are recognized and appreciated? Do you feel that there are opportunities for growth and development in your current role or within the company? How satisfied are you with the work environment and company culture? Do you feel that your work-life balance is manageable and supportive of your overall well-being? It’s important to provide a range of possible answers such as a scale from 1-5 to ensure you get the most accurate answers. Interpreting the results of an employee engagement survey can be challenging, as it is important to consider the specific needs and concerns of each individual team or department. It may be helpful to compare the results to industry benchmarks, or to track employee engagement strategies over time to see if they are having a positive impact. While surveys are a fantastic tool to measure employee engagement, there are some other methods you can try too. One-on-one conversations : Meeting with employees individually can provide an opportunity to get a more in-depth understanding of their engagement levels and any areas for improvement. Focus groups : Gathering employees together in a focus group setting can provide a forum for discussion and feedback on engagement issues. Employee task forces : Creating task forces or committees that focus on employee engagement can provide a structured way for employees to provide input and employee engagement ideas . Observations : Observing employees in their work environment can provide insight into engagement levels, including things like body language, work quality, and interactions with colleagues. Metrics : Tracking metrics such as retention rates, productivity levels, and customer satisfaction scores can provide an indication of overall engagement levels within the organization. Exit interviews : Asking departing employees about their experience and engagement levels while with the company can provide valuable insights into areas for improvement. One way to do this is through employee exit surveys . Improving Employee Engagement: There are a number of strategies that businesses can use to improve employee engagement. These include: Communication: Effective communication is essential for employee engagement. This includes regular check-ins with team members, transparent communication from leadership, and a willingness to listen to and address employee concerns. Communication can be improved through the use of tools like employee surveys, focus groups, and suggestion boxes. The impact of improved communication can be measured through increased employee participation in company events and decision-making processes, as well as higher scores on engagement surveys related to communication. Culture and work environment: A positive work culture and environment can go a long way in improving team engagement. This includes creating a sense of community and inclusivity, promoting work-life balance, and fostering a culture of trust and respect. The impact of a positive work culture can be measured through employee surveys, focus groups, and retention rates. Growth and development opportunities : Providing opportunities for training, development, and career advancement can help employees feel more invested in their work and their organization. The impact of these opportunities can be measured through employee feedback and the success of employees who have participated in training employee engagement programs . Recognition and appreciation : Recognizing and appreciating the contributions of employees can help to improve their engagement and motivation. This can include formal recognition programs, as well as more informal gestures of appreciation. The impact of recognition and appreciation can be measured through employee surveys and retention rates. Work-life balance : Ensuring that employees have a healthy work-life balance is essential for maintaining healthy people engagement. This might include offering flexible work arrangements, promoting the importance of taking breaks and vacations, and providing resources for stress management. The impact of work-life balance can be measured through employee satisfaction surveys and absenteeism rates. Collaborative decision-making : Involving employees in decision-making processes can help to improve their engagement and ownership of their work. This can be achieved through tools like suggestion boxes, town hall meetings, and employee committees. The impact of collaborative decision-making can be measured through employee feedback and the success of initiatives that were the result of employee input. Feedback and performance management : Providing regular, constructive feedback and a clear performance management process can help to improve employee engagement by giving employees a sense of direction and support. The impact of effective feedback and performance management can be measured through employee satisfaction surveys and improved performance metrics. Health and wellness programs : Offering wellness programs and resources can help to improve employee engagement by promoting physical and mental well-being. This might include offering gym memberships, mental health resources, and healthy eating options. The impact of wellness programs can be measured through employee participation rates and improved health metrics such as absenteeism and healthcare costs. Flexible work arrangements : Offering flexible work arrangements, such as remote work or flexible scheduling, can help to improve employee engagement by allowing employees to have more control over their work environment and schedule. The impact of flexible work arrangements can be measured through employee satisfaction surveys and retention rates. Employee involvement and empowerment : Empowering employees and giving them a voice in the decision-making process can help to improve workforce engagement and ownership of their work. This can be achieved through tools like employee committees, suggestion boxes, and leadership development programs. The impact of employee empowerment can be measured through employee feedback and the success of initiatives that were the result of employee input. How to Measure the Success of an Employee Engagement Program? Any decent program is worthless without the means to measure how effective it is and employee engagement programs are no different. Some key steps to consider include: Define success: Before implementing any engagement initiatives, it is important to define what success looks like for your organization. This might include specific metrics such as retention rates, productivity levels, or customer satisfaction scores. Having clear goals in place will help to guide your engagement efforts and measure their effectiveness. Assess the current state of employee engagement : To effectively improve employee engagement, it is important to understand the current level of engagement within your organization. This can be done through employee surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one conversations with employees. This will help to identify areas for improvement and guide the development of engagement strategies. Monitor the Implementation of engagement strategies : Once you have a clear understanding of the current state of engagement and your goals for improvement, you can begin to implement engagement strategies. These might include things like regular check-ins with employees, providing growth and development opportunities, or implementing recognition and appreciation programs. Measure and track progress : To effectively manage the success of engagement efforts, it is important to regularly measure and track progress. This can be done through employee surveys, focus groups, or through the use of metrics such as retention rates, productivity levels, or customer satisfaction scores. By tracking progress, you can identify what is working well and what areas may need further improvement. Make adjustments as needed : As you implement engagement strategies and track progress, you may find that certain approaches are more effective than others. It is important to be flexible and willing to make adjustments as needed in order to optimize the success of your engagement efforts. Why Many Employee Engagement Programs Fail? Employee engagement programs are all the rage right now, but in most settings they fail. Here are some of the most common reasons why. Lack of employee input : Many employee benefits programs are designed by management or HR without much input from the employees themselves. While they usually look great on paper, once they are implemented things often go awry. A truly good program will involve your employees from the start to ensure everyone is on the same page. Lack of communication : If employees are not aware of the benefits that are available to them or how to access them, they are less likely to use them. It’s a horrible waste of time and resources to create a program that people just don’t understand or respect. Communication is therefore key in making them work. Limited appeal: Some employee benefits programs may simply not be appealing to a significant portion of the workforce. For example, a day care program in an office of young, single staff just isn’t going to work. Lack of convenience: If employees have to go out of their way to access or utilize benefits, they may be less likely to do so. You can’t expect employees to engage with an optional program if they feel it is unfriendly to use. Managing Employee Engagement For The Long Term Managing employee engagement programs over the long term requires a sustained and strategic approach. It’s not enough to think of employee engagement as a one and done task. It needs to be nurtured and continuously managed to ensure these programs bear fruits in the long run. Some key considerations for long-term success include: Making employee engagement a priority : Employee engagement should always be a priority for leadership and a core part of the company's culture. This means regularly communicating the importance of engagement, being open to employee feedback and ideas, and consistently taking action to address employee concerns. The moment these programs fall out of focus, your workers will realize and results will likely plummet. Ensuring alignment with business goals : These programs will ultimately be limited in how effective they can be if they don’t properly align with the business’s goals. You need to find the right balance and create a real sense of synergy to both get the best out of your employees and ensure their long term engagement. Involving employees in program design and implementation : It’s easy to fall into the trap of forcing policies in a top down matter, but a truly successful employee engagement strategy needs to involve your employees.This might involve gathering employee feedback through surveys or focus groups, or involving employees in the decision-making process. Measuring and tracking progress: Regularly measuring and tracking the impact of engagement programs can help to identify what is working well and what areas may need improvement. You can follow some of the suggestions we provided in the earlier section on measuring progress. Making adjustments as needed : As engagement programs evolve over time, it may be necessary to make adjustments in order to optimize their impact. This might involve updating program offerings or revising program goals based on feedback and data. Again, you need to treat employee engagement as a living, breathing organism and make the right changes as needed. Summary Improving employee engagement is a continuous process that requires ongoing effort and attention. By understanding the factors that contribute to engagement, regularly assessing and measuring it, and implementing strategies to improve it, businesses can create a positive work environment and culture that drives success. Companies that prioritize employee engagement are more likely to retain top talent, boost productivity, and improve overall performance. As such, it is essential for businesses to prioritize employee engagement as a key part of their HR strategy.

This policy typically outlines the types of training programs available, the process for employees to request training, and the expectations for both employees and the organization in terms of training and development. The importance of having a robust employee training and development policy cannot be overstated. It is essential for organizations to invest in their employees' growth and development to remain competitive in today's rapidly changing business environment.

Additionally, a well-defined training and development policy can help organizations attract top talent and build a strong, skilled workforce. To write a company employee training and development policy, follow these step-by-step guidelines: 1. Conduct a needs assessment to identify the training needs of your employees. 2.

When the pandemic broke out, the QSR industry was badly hit as many employees were increasingly wary of working in such a high-risk environment. Along with the stimulus package, this resulted in more job vacancies in the industry than there are job seekers . According to the US Labor Department data, the restaurant industry is seeing the highest quit rate in two decades despite a general increase in their hourly pay. This shows that simply paying them a higher wage is no longer enough to retain employees. The retention rate of your company depends heavily on your employee satisfaction. Ignoring your hourly workers and not doing anything to keep them in your company inevitably leads to low productivity, decreased sales, high turnover rate, high business costs, and ultimately, a bad reputation. Yes, it can get that bad. If you're dealing with a high turnover rate, or you've just started your business and want to ensure that all your employees are satisfied with their job, there are certain actions you have to take. Here are several proven methods from the top five QSR brands. 1. Starbucks Starbucks is known to be one of the QSR brands with a relatively low turnover rate. At only 65%, the popular coffeehouse definitely stands out from other brands that often have turnover rates of more than 100%. How do they achieve this success? By keeping employee engagement at the forefront of their strategies. Let’s dive into some of the ways they make their employees feel appreciated. Provide Comprehensive Employee Benefits To start, Starbucks offers comprehensive employee benefits that not only include healthcare and insurance coverage but also vigorously assist their employees in their personal and educational development. Exclusively termed ‘ Your Special Blend ,’ they make sure to be as inclusive as possible by providing mental health support to those who need it. To them, one’s mental health is just as important as their physical health. Starbucks also provides a 401(k) retirement plan for their employees and has a Caring Unites Partners (CUP) Fund to assist those who require financial aid due to unforeseen circumstances. With such benefits, it’s no wonder why employees choose to stay with Starbucks. Treat Employees as 'Partners' Starbucks refers to their hourly employees as ‘partners’ as they feel that they, too, have a share in the company’s success. But it is not just the label that is noteworthy. Their exceptional treatment of employees is apparent in the way they invest in them. Starbucks encourages their partners to continually develop themselves academically through their College Achievement Plan . By showing that they care, employee morale is boosted. And honestly, if you can make your employees love coming to work every day, that’s a sign that you’ve succeeded, right? 2. Jimmy John's Leverage Technology When Hiring It’s a no-brainer: technology simplifies our lives in every way possible. And when it comes to hiring employees, this is no exception. Jimmy John’s franchisees use automated hiring tools to recruit the right people for the job. Using features such as job board integrations and smart screening , they are able to not only widen their candidate pool but also filter only those who are the best fit for the job. By using such hiring tools to hire better, your employees are likely to stay longer with your company. After all, why would you leave when the job is suitable for you? Such technological tools are also useful after the employee gets hired. With DailyPay, Kensington Hill Capital LLC, one of the franchisees of Jimmy John’s, could provide on-demand pay to their employees. For workers struggling to pay rent or bills on time, this could be a lifesaving bonus as they no longer have to wait for a certain time of the month to cover emergency expenses. Prioritizing your employees' needs and using tools to give them practical benefits will always encourage more of your workers to continue working with you. Like Jimmy John’s, you can also leverage technology to provide the best for your employees. 3. Chipotle Invest Heavily in Employees When it comes to retaining employees, most often than not, the best QSR brands will have a comprehensive suite of employees’ benefits. Just like Starbucks, Chipotle also offers a good deal of educational and health benefits. In collaboration with Guild, an education and upskilling company, Chipotle offers eligible employees a debt-free educational program. Thanks to this, the QSR brand managed to increase their retention rate by 3.5 times among the students who are part of the program. This is also part of their effort to develop leaders within their company, whether or not they decide to stay with Chipotle. Aside from the educational benefit, Chipotle also created transparent career paths for their hourly workers. About 70% of their general managers started off as hourly workers. Thanks to the certified training at every level provided by the company, hourly workers can get promoted easily. Those who follow this career path could attain the highest general manager position in just 3.5 years! Investing in employees is nothing new to Chipotle. To them, every dime they put in their employees counts towards the future of the company. Reward Employees At Chipotle, eligible employees are also entitled to a quarterly bonus of up to an extra month’s pay. To qualify for this bonus, employees need to meet specified goals, including preset sales and cash flow. When the bonus program first kicked off, 2,600 employees qualified in the first few months. This allowed the brand’s turnover rate to decrease at both the management and crew levels. Last year, the fast-food chain gave out $6.5 million in discretionary bonuses to employees of various levels amidst the pandemic. This came a week after Chipotle raised their rates for hourly workers by 10% to show their appreciation to those who continued working even during the COVID-19 crisis. In times of financial uncertainty, such actions can foster a sense of loyalty among employees and improve retention rates. 4. McDonald's Listen to Employees Being one of the largest fast-food chains in the world, McDonald’s prides itself in training their employees. They ensure that their workers are not only equipped with the hard skills required for the job but the soft skills as well. This includes the ability to work in a team and having responsibility and responsiveness in the workplace. What sets their training apart from other companies? Well, McDonald’s training is continuously updated to keep the opinions of the current workforce and employees in mind. For example, the “ Workforce Survey '' they regularly conduct helps them better understand what employees value in a job in the long run. The responses they receive, in combination with their employees’ feedback, allow them to incorporate certain valuable skills in their training programs. By doing so, they are able to improve their employee engagement and encourage their workers to stay with the company for a longer time. Aside from getting feedback, another step taken by McDonald’s was to increase their hourly wages to over $13/hr . Prioritizing the preferences of employees is important. But as an employer, you would still need to ensure that you are paying your workers enough for the job they do in order to truly retain them. 5. Shake Shack Invest Heavily in Employees Shake Shack is another company that invests heavily in their employees, especially now that the industry is facing a labor crunch. Just this year, the brand announced that they will be putting in more than $10 million in their restaurant-level employees. Most of the fund is going towards their wage increase but it also will be a part of their added hiring bonuses. Share Common Values Cultivating the right culture in your company is essential if you want to retain your hourly workers. Most companies neglect their hourly employees in this aspect and this might just be the reason why the turnover rate is so high among them. For Shake Shack, they believe in treating everyone equally regardless of where they are from or how they look. The brand plans on boosting the company’s diversity by aiming for 50% minority representation in leadership positions by 2025. They’re also working towards gender parity as part of their efforts to be more inclusive. Undoubtedly, this will retain existing employees and may even increase their popularity among job seekers. Gen Z-ers and millennials make up most of the QSR industry’s hourly employees and this demographic tends to be more passionate when it comes to diversity and inclusion. Since these values are important to them, promoting and practicing such values will likely make them stay since they find it meaningful to work for a company that shares their principles. Retain Your Hourly Workers When it comes to hiring (or rehiring), prevention is better than cure. Retaining employees is always better than hiring new ones as the latter will incur unnecessary costs to your business, which could have otherwise been avoided. Though the pandemic may have shaken the foundation of the QSR industry, there is still hope in survival if you treat your employees right. Truth be told, you may even get through another crisis in the future. As you would expect, providing basic benefits can no longer be effective if you want to keep your employees. As a franchise owner, consider taking some pointers from the QSR brands above and you might just be able to keep your employee turnover rate low.

In order to attract top talent, employers must think outside the box and get creative in their hiring strategies to stand out from the competition. Expanding on your usual recruitment methods can also help your business reach a more diverse pool of applicants and bring fresh perspectives and new skills to your workforce. Here are 47 ideas you can use to source, recruit, and retain hourly workers—as soon as today. Optimize your job descriptions and applications 1. Write shorter job descriptions People don't have time to read long, overly wordy job descriptions. Focus on plainly stating what you're looking for and, most importantly, what your business offers employees. 2. Clearly detail what they can expect Accurately outline the core responsibilities and day-to-day activities of the job. When you offer this level of detail, job seekers can better determine if your role (or company) is a good fit. 3. Highlight incentives or perks If your company offers free meals, employee discounts, or tuition reimbursement, be sure to mention it in your job posts. Incentives and perks are part of the entire benefits package. 4. Test two versions of your job post Different job posts appeal to different applicants. Adopt a more formal, professional ad and run it against one with more casual language and fun punctuation to highlight your team's personality. 5. Avoid sounding like every other ad Too many job posts will say something generic like “need go-getters'' or superlatives like “join a rockstar team.” Instead, describe what the job is actually about and what applicants can expect. 6. Attract interest with a signing bonus For those difficult-to-fill roles or positions with high turnover, consider offering a signing bonus as an added incentive. Be specific on when the bonus will be paid out (e.g. after 6 months of work.) 7. Add employee reviews to job posts Feature testimonials from employees describing what they like about the job, their coworkers, and the workplace to add credibility and help motivate applicants. 8. Don't use jargon in job descriptions Avoid special words or expressions, acronyms, or job req numbers (i.e. use “Shift Leader” not “Shift Leader II - 32504”) to ensure greater clarity and less confusion. 9. Incorporate storytelling in your job ads Ask a team member who does the same job what they like about the role and why they're good at it, and weave those insights into an intriguing storyline. Using their point of view makes it relatable. 10. Tell applicants what makes you different It's important to realize not everyone is familiar with your restaurant or what makes it special. A job post is an opportunity to talk about your team culture and how employees can benefit from it. 11. Be transparent about any job requirements Being upfront about specific hiring standards saves you from wasting time interviewing anyone who won't make the cut. For example, if the job requires a drug screening, mention it in your ad. 12. Always mention the hourly compensation You can write the most interesting job listing, one that attracts tons of views. But once you fail to include the hourly pay in your ad, you risk losing their interest and won't get as many applicants. 13. Remember to include the working hours Is the job part time or full time? Are you adding team members to the day shift or the night shift? Do job seekers pick their own schedule, or will one be assigned to them? People need to know. 14. Make your job listings easier to read Italics and bolded text can help emphasize the important details of the job description and draw attention where needed. Ideal since most job seekers will skim your ads, not read them entirely. 15. Use a mobile-friendly application 2 in 3 candidates use a mobile device to apply for jobs. And they'll give up if the application takes longer than 15 minutes to fill out. So make sure your application is mobile-friendly—no clunky browser experiences! Use a diverse sourcing strategy 16. Create a referral program Referral programs are great for motivating current employees to recruit new ones; typically with the promise of getting a bonus once their referral is hired. And they work. Referrals are 8.7x more effective than job boards at sourcing new applicants. 17. Host a recruitment event Consider hosting your very own recruitment event: an open day where interested applicants can visit your workplace, chat with your team members, and learn about the opportunities you offer. 18. Attend local hiring fairs A hiring fair is a great way to attract a bunch of applicants from your local community. (Not to mention, it gets you in front of customers, too!). Throw in a signing bonus for anyone who accepts an offer on the spot. 19. Connect with local colleges Reach out to nearby colleges and universities and ask if you can post your job opportunities in student newspapers or on campus. Emphasize flexible hours or part-time positions for students. 20. Recruit at your location Some of your best job candidates can start as your most loyal customers. Use QR codes and text-to-apply numbers throughout your business to inspire people to apply on-site by phone. These active sourcing methods are 5x more effective than job boards at sourcing new applicants. 21. Maximizing your store receipts Take advantage of any and every possible marketing material—including store receipts. Print those text-to-apply numbers and QR codes right on your receipts so potential hires have a way to apply to your jobs in their back pocket. Regardless of where it goes, they'll know where to find you and your job at a moment's notice. 22. Offer coupons with QR codes You know how we recommended throwing QR codes on receipts? This works just as well on coupons. Offer a free menu item or other incentive, and include a QR code or text-to-apply number on the other side of the coupon. Not only does it entice applicants to apply, but it also serves up a tasty perk. 23. Customer recommendations Your customers can be an unexpected source of applicant leads. Train your team to ask customers if they know anyone who might be interested in applying for openings. Word-of-mouth referrals from satisfied customers can lead to awesome new hires. 24. Use oversized signs Sometimes, the simplest tactics are the most effective. Whip up some big ol' signs about your job openings and have your crew take turns waving them outside your business. Watch as passersby and job seekers alike can't help but take notice. 25. Create promotional videos Visual content can be a powerful tool for recruitment. Produce a video discussing job opportunities and benefits at your organization. Upload it to YouTube and invest in targeted promotion within your zip code. Nowadays, no one can resist a good video, and job seekers will be drawn to an engaging one that helps them land a job. 26. Get on the local radio Don't underestimate the power of traditional media. Making a quick cameo on your local radio station is a great way to share information about open job opportunities with commuters. 27. Reconnect with previous applicants Remember past applicants who almost made the cut? Well, don't write them off just yet. Shoot them a friendly text and let them know your organization is still on the lookout for new hires. 28. Build a social media presence for your store Applicants often search your brand's website and social media presence to make their decision about working for your business. Use it to curate your workplace's image. 29. Get employees involved in your social media Encourage your team to share their positive work experiences on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Ask them to share why they like their jobs, highlighting the unique aspects that make your company stand out. To sweeten the deal, offer them a gift card as an incentive for their participation. 30. Leverage your personal social media Your social media channels are just as valuable as your employees'. Share those job openings on platforms like Instagram or Facebook to cast your net even wider. Your circle of friends might just include the perfect fit for your team, and they could help spread the word like wildfire. 31. Take advantage of job boards Don't discount job boards altogether. Include them in the mix! Online job sites like Indeed and Craigslist are great for advertising your job listings. Especially since these job boards are typically visited by thousands of active job seekers on a daily basis. 32. Sponsor a job post Sponsored jobs get priority over free listings in relevant search results. They retain their optimal visibility for as long as they're sponsored, which means they're seen more often by job seekers. 33. Change how you use job boards With some tools, you can post your job listings to multiple job boards at once and view all applicants within a single dashboard. This enables you to get your job posting in front of more applicants with less manual effort. 34. Explore niche job boards It's all about having a diverse sourcing strategy—that includes major job boards, but especially niche ones. These specialized platforms are treasure troves tailored to specific industries or skills. They're perfect for finding applicants with those special qualifications you're after. 35. Anticipate seasonal hiring trends High schools, colleges, and universities are filled with potential job seekers who need work and extra cash whenever summer hits or term breaks occur. Post job listings on campus or in town. 36. Turn new store openings into job fairs People get excited whenever a new restaurant opens in their city. Take advantage of that excitement for your organization's grand opening by accepting applications while you enjoy added foot traffic in-store. 37. Advertise in local print media In the digital age, print media may seem old-fashioned, but it can still be a valuable resource for reaching certain demographics. Consider placing advertisements in local newspapers or magazines that have a strong readership in your area. This approach can help you reach folks who might not be glued to their screens all day. 38. Network with local businesses Join local business networking groups to beef up your professional connections. By building bonds with fellow business owners and pros, you might just score some referrals or recommendations for top-notch applicants. 39. Give someone a second chance Workers with criminal records are often grateful for a fresh start. With 12.2% lower than average annual turnover rates and federal tax credits up to $9,600 per new hire, it's a sound investment. 40. Partner with community-based organizations Building strong ties with your local community can pay off in your search for qualified applicants. Chat with community-based organizations in your area and explore the possibility of forming partnerships. With their deep connections and local know-how, they'll serve up applicants that fit your values and needs. 41. Reach out to veteran organizations Supporting veterans as they transition to civilian life is both a noble endeavor and a smart recruitment strategy. Reach out to local veteran organizations and ask about potential partnerships. Veterans often bring unique skills and qualities to the workforce, making them valuable assets to any team. By collaborating with these organizations, you can tap into a talent pool that is dedicated and disciplined. Provide an applicant-friendly hiring process 42. Embrace automation Applicants don't want to wait around for a response. In fact , employers who reach out within one hour of receiving an application increase their chances of making a hire by 25%! Automation allows you to send trigger communications at key points in the hiring process and keep applicants engaged in your opportunity. 43. Appeal to your Spanish-speaking applicants Use a hiring platform that allows job seekers to find your job postings, schedule interviews, and receive automated messages about their applications' status—all in Spanish from start to finish. 44. Save time with smart screening questions Use an applicant tracking system that automatically filters and rejects applicants who fail to meet your hiring criteria. Like someone who indicates they have 2 years of experience when your job requires at least 4. 45. Cut hiring steps Not every role or position in your hourly workforce requires multiple interviews to make a hiring decision. If they're qualified and pass your background check, make an offer within a day or two. 46. Try text messaging Given that 90% of people read a text within the first three minutes , using text messaging in your recruiting strategy increases the chances applicants will stay engaged in your opportunity. 47. Set aside regular times for interviews Rather than scramble to find time throughout your busy day to meet with candidates at the last minute, always block out specific hours throughout the week to schedule interviews. Even better, advertise open interview hours where anyone can do a walk-in interview. Conclusion With Workstream's HR, Hiring, and Payroll platform, you can put these ideas into practice as you hire, manage, and pay your teams.

Luckily, there are resources available that can help you work smarter, not harder, as you build your dream team. How can I post a job without paying? In 2024, you don't have to pay to play in the job recruiting arena. But as you'll find out in this guide, there are limitations. Most free job posting sites offer free and paid account options. Free usage ranges in both features and access, with some platforms offering as little as one free posting. Yet, features like hiring metrics, application tracking, and unlimited job postings can only be accessed through premium memberships or sponsored job ads. Still, there are several free job posting sites and job posting templates that can jumpstart your search without requiring a steep investment. 11 free job posting sites As an employer, you always strive to find the best talent for your organization. However, searching for talented individuals can be quite difficult and time-consuming, especially if you don't know where to begin. Fortunately, there are several job posting sites and job posting examples available that can assist you in this endeavor. But with so many job posting sites to choose from, how do you know which one to use? The best job posting sites and aggregators for you depend on your organization's unique needs. To make your job as an employer easier, we've compiled a list of the pros and cons of some of the best free job posting sites as of April 2023. 1. Indeed With over 300 million unique monthly visitors, 245 million resumes uploaded, and 790 million total ratings and reviews, Indeed comes out on top as the #1 job site. As an employer, you can post jobs on Indeed for free with no hidden costs. But as one of the most popular free job posting sites, it's no stranger to tough competition. Pros: Its high volume of users increases your reach and applicant pool Indeed offers free hiring tools for employers, such as job skill assessments and tests It's ideal for large-scale hiring initiatives It works for full-time, part-time, and contract positions Cons: High volume of users = High volume of competition Some job types aren't eligible for free unlimited postings Finding quality applicants on Indeed without sponsoring your job post can be difficult It's not recommended for attracting high-level applicants 2. Handshake Looking for new grads? Handshake is one of the unique free job posting sites that doubles as a networking platform. It allows employers to interact with students and new graduates. You can connect and post job listings for free. Handshake advocates for supporting diverse applicants, with over 12 million active students and alumni on the platform. Pros: Easily set up virtual interviews with applicants It's great for filling entry-level and remote jobs You can join virtual networking events to find new applicants Cons: Not beneficial for mid or senior-level positions You'll need a premium membership to source quality applicants, check into events, access analytics, and more 3. Google for Jobs 73% of job candidates start their search on Google. This makes Google for Jobs a prime opportunity for employers and recruiters. Google for Jobs is different from most free job posting sites in that it's a service rather than its own platform. It gathers data from other job posting sites to feature the roles that best align with the applicant's needs. It's completely free to use and doesn't allow for sponsored job listings. Pros: It can increase your visibility in job search engines Thanks to its specifics, and helpful job filters, it can allow you to attract more qualified applicants Cons: Google for Jobs doesn't allow you to view an applicant's profile or access a resume database like other sites You have to use third-party sites to access the service You'll need to understand Google Analytics and structured data to fully access its benefits 4. LinkedIn With over 900 million members, LinkedIn is a powerhouse for finding quality applicants and connections. Unlike other free job posting sites, LinkedIn job posting can get your open positions in front of new applicants and establish your company as a thought leader in the process. Yet, you can only post one free job listing at a time on LinkedIn. You'll likely need to sponsor your job listings to enjoy its features. Pros: The platform's popularity and success can increase your applicant pool It's great for sourcing low, mid, and high-level applicants It offers affordable pay-per-click sponsoring options to increase visibility Cons: You're limited to posting one free job posting at a time There's a high level of competition, making it difficult to succeed without sponsoring your job openings 5. Jora Jora is one of the best free job posting sites that caters to an international audience in over 30 countries. It's comparable to Indeed's interface but offers a much smaller applicant base. Employers can post up to 10 free job listings each month on Jora. Pros: It offers a U.S. career portal to allow employers to only focus on hiring local applicants Cons: It has less traffic and a smaller user base compared to other platforms No resume database for employers There aren't many features for recruiters or employers to enhance their search 6. Learn4Good On the opposite side of the job search spectrum, we have Learn4Good : One of the free job posting sites that focuses on creating opportunities for students. As an employer, you can create a free account that gives you 20 listing credits to use over six months. You can pay to upgrade your account and receive more credits. Pros: Learn4Good is great for recruiting students to fill entry-level positions No credit card is needed to sign up Cons: The platform's credit system can be difficult to understand Your number of credits limits the number of job listings you can post 7. Jobcase Jobcase has over 120 million registered applicants and 20 million unique visitors each month. It's great for making quick connections and offers a community-like feel for applicants. Employers and recruiters can join Jobcase for free, but they'll need to pay to access its complete benefits. Pros: Its specific job search algorithm only shows applicants the positions they're qualified for Cons: Users have expressed difficulty when trying to delete filled positions The algorithm can be too exclusive; your listing might not be shown to as many applicants if your qualifications are too specific 8. PostJobFree The name speaks for itself: PostJobFree allows employers to post 10 free job listings each day. The platform offers premium memberships, which unlock benefits such as access to applicant contact information and resume views. Pros: You can post free job listings across job boards They offer a comparably affordable premium plan, making it great for small businesses It's a long-standing online platform, in operation since 2007 Cons: Job postings are not unlimited There's no available applicant tracking system The site's user experience isn't as seamless and trustworthy as its competitors Frequently asked questions Can you post a job on ZipRecruiter for free? No—ZipRecruiter doesn't offer any free plans as of June 2024. However, they do offer a 4-day free trial. You can post an ad and work with any applicants you receive during this timeframe free of charge. Pricing plans start at $299 per month. This membership comes with customizable tools and templates to boost your talent search. However, ZipRecruiter has relatively fewer resumes in its database than other platforms. Is there a site where people post looking for jobs? Most career sites are designed to put employers in charge of the hiring process, ensuring they find the best hires available. However, social-driven job posting platforms, like LinkedIn and Handshake, allow applicants to create their own content, reach out, and build their presence. You may find applicants seeking positions by searching the #opentowork, #jobsearch, #hireme, #jobseeker, and #jobsearching hashtags on LinkedIn and other social media platforms. Find some creative job posting examples here . Is it free to post jobs on LinkedIn? Yes, but it's limited. You can post one free job at a time on LinkedIn. Free job listings expire within 21 days of your post date. All free job listings will appear in LinkedIn's search results, allowing you to receive, filter, and manage your applicants. With the right job title and job description, you can find success in finding the best applicants. However, free LinkedIn job posts can quickly become less visible in applicants' search results. When you've hit a certain number of applicants, your free listing will be removed from the search results. However, promoted LinkedIn job postings reach an average of 3x more candidates than free postings. They are featured at the top of search results, stay active until you close them, and receive unlimited job applications. Another alternative to LinkedIn job posting is Craigslist job posting. What is an onboarding assessment? Onboarding should be a dynamic process. You want to know if your onboarding practices are effective and if people feel supported and engaged from the get-go. Utilize a few of these strategies to get a full, accurate picture of what people experience when coming on board with your company. - Time-productivity ratios: How long does it take for an employee to get \"situated\" and begin adding value? The better an onboarding program is, the lower this ratio will be. - Turnover and retention rates: How often do you have to onboard new employees because of dissatisfied ones? Are people staying on the team to move into new positions or leaving because they weren't supported? - New employee surveys: Deliver employee engagement surveys throughout the onboarding process and after to get an accurate picture of how people feel and what they need. - Informal feedback: Engage in casual conversation and informal check-ins to develop relationships and show that you're invested in an employee's success and well-being. Find better applicants faster There's no one-size-fits-all for your organization's hiring process. But in today's fast-paced world, the hourly workforce has become mobile-first. As employers and recruiters, we must adapt accordingly. With Workstream's advanced automation technologies and two-way texting capabilities , you can now convert applicants into employees with just your mobile phone. As a result?

But what happens when your business needs change? Should you stick to the way you’ve always approached hiring? Or should you adjust your hiring strategy to reflect those changes? The answer is obvious. You adjust. But how? In this blog post, we’re going to show you by discussing a step-by-step framework on how to evaluate and evolve your hiring strategy. By applying what you’ll learn here, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of not only your hiring strategy but also: How your hiring strategy affects the likelihood of achieving your business goals How to avoid being unexpectedly understaffed How to align your hiring strategy to commercial and financial benchmarks And more Sounds good? Great! Let’s get started by doing the work you might be avoiding… Step 1: Answer the tough questions To build out and improve your hiring strategy, you need to understand thoroughly where you stand right now. Is it articulated in any formal, documented way? Or is it more reactionary, hiring as-needed for vacant or understaffed roles? Whether you’ve formalized your hiring strategy or not, it’s actually a complex combination of many factors. We recommend assessing these aspects of your hiring experience, from top to bottom, as best you can: Where are you sourcing applicants? (Job boards and career fairs—which ones? Employee referrals and word-of-mouth? Walk-ins? Social media?) Where did you source your best and/or longest-tenured employees? Which channels are providing you with the best cultural fits? How much are you spending on advertising and promotion for hiring? Where are you spending it, and how does that correlate to the success of those hires? What is your churn rate? How many positions do you have at full staffing levels, and how often are you hiring for them? How often are you operating at full staffing levels, and how often (and to what extent) are you operating understaffed? What trends do you see over time for applicant flow, hiring rate and retention rate? How have your staffing needs evolved over time? How have your hiring practices correlated with the financial successes or struggles of your business? It’s key to dig in deep enough to find the actual answers to these questions—not simply the answers you think or believe to be true. You might presume your new hires are coming predominantly from job postings, when actually they are coming from employee referrals. Step 2: Get clear on your goals Once you understand where your business stands, you can formulate where you want to go. What are your business goals? Often people express these in terms of gross sales or net profit. But you might have other quantifiable goals—to double your franchise locations in five years, to be the top-selling QSR in your neighborhood or to be able to donate a million dollars a year to local nonprofits. Accounting for how your business is doing right now, where you want to go and when you want to get there, you can develop a staffing plan to understand how many people you’ll need to help you attain those goals. One piece of advice for QSRs: The restaurant industry is not an end-goal game. Rather than setting one-time goals by themselves (such as “This location will make a million dollars”), set rolling, SMART goals that can help you meet and exceed those goals (such as “This location will net $50,000 a quarter”). To help you get there, you can even take more fixed goals, like doubling your number of franchises and breaking them into improvement markers at your current locations. This will set your business up for sustained success and ensure you plan to have enough staff to reach your goals. Step 3: Align your hiring strategy with your business goals Once you have that clear sense of your goals and how you want to grow your business, you’ll also have a sense of your gaps—and the future needs to fill them. How many people do you need? In what roles? And how do you need to build your hiring strategy to meet those needs on an ongoing, rolling basis? If you’re not quite sure how to answer those questions just yet, steps 4-7 will help. Step 4: Figure your general staffing needs You can assess and estimate your staffing needs going forward using: Staffing ratios Staffing ratios rely on the rule-of-thumb method to estimate staffing needs according to organizational structure. This strategy works well if you’re maintaining the same operational structure. Let’s say the ideal setup for your QSR is five FTE hourly workers on the floor for every manager. Short-term, you’ll need to maintain that number of workers for optimal operations. Long-term, if you’re expanding, you know you’ll need to plan on hiring five more staffers for each manager you add or promote. Productivity ratios Productivity ratios estimate how much product or customer throughput your team can handle per person. Then, you can apply that estimate to sales forecasts or growth goals to determine your hiring needs. For example, a QSR that sells 10,000 sandwiches a month, with five staffers on the floor at any point, can anticipate needing to hire five more staffers to reach 20,000 sandwiches a month—or maintain those staffing levels to hold steady at 10,000 sandwiches. Step 5: Get flexible with a dynamic hiring plan Of course, how often do things go according to plan? And when is the restaurant world ever a perfectly-insulated environment where your ratios remain static and always effective? No straightforward business forecast or staffing plan will go as anticipated. So, it’s critical to focus instead on being adaptable – especially during this transition phase of running a business during the “new normal”. A simple way to do this is to be proactive instead of reactive. As one of our Workstream customers once said: “You need to start hiring today for the roles you’ll need filled three months from now.” Let’s use those hypothetical five FTE workers per manager again. You want to maintain that ratio, but let’s say historically you need to rehire for three of those hourly positions each quarter. Rather than reacting to a vacant role by hiring, you can anticipate that hiring need by planning to hire one worker a month on a rolling basis. Yes, sometimes this will result in having six workers to schedule for shifts—and playing the numbers, you’ll still sometimes be a worker down. But the staffing will stay more reliable, keeping the customer experience smooth and preventing much of the lost-business cost of an understaffed team. Step 6: Tie hiring growth to financial, commercial or other benchmarks Taking a growth mindset to reach your goals, you can also set benchmarks for when to hire additional team members—and when to scale out the organizational structure. The productivity ratio described in step 4 is not always predictive—meaning, doubling your workforce may not automatically double your throughput. You need to hire more people when the growth is ready to happen, more than the other way around. To do so, you can tie your hiring strategy to other business objectives . For instance, you might hire another manager only after your store sees X% increase in sales or customer visits. Or, rather than setting a date to sign up for another franchise, you decide to do so only after your existing location maintains a certain sales figure for Y months. Step 7: Customize your hiring plan to fit your business There’s no magic ratio for maximizing staffing-to-profit. And you might have other aspects of the customer experience that determine your staffing needs—the speed of service, the number of locations, expanded hours, community outreach and involvement. Consider these key points when building a hiring plan that works for your business: How many employees, in what roles, do you need to reach your goals? When do you need them, when will they be most impactful and when can you best afford them? How much of this number can you realistically attain through hiring? How much can you realistically attain by reducing churn ? What roles do you need to backfill? Based on your historical churn data, how often do you need to fill them? How can you address this need with a rolling hiring strategy? What new roles or skills do you need to onboard to maintain or scale your current operations? At what point do you need them—and when can you hire for them? How can you modernize your scheduling and staffing practices to maximize the potential of your workforce, in terms of both their productivity and their satisfaction with your company? Historically, how much has hiring cost you—both in direct costs (job boards, hiring managers, etc.) and in indirect costs (lost productivity from being understaffed, managers focused on hiring instead of serving customers, etc.)? How much time has it historically taken your company to fill vacant roles? What other resources are you dedicating to hiring, onboarding and retaining employees? The honest, thorough answers to these questions will help you clearly understand the tools and support you may need—and those you already have—as you build out your workforce. Final Thoughts An effective hiring strategy is more than simply hiring people whenever you have vacant roles. Rather, it involves having a clear understanding of your business’s goals and then hiring people in progressive steps, with dynamic flexibility. To build that type of hiring strategy, follow the 7 steps we’ve shared in this blog post: Answer tough questions about your current hiring strategy Get clear on your business goals Align your hiring strategy with your business goals Figure out your general staffing needs using staffing and productivity ratios Add flexibility to your hiring plan to account for unexpected obstacles Tie hiring growth to financial, commercial or other benchmarks Customize your hiring plan to fit your business And if, during all of this, you realize that you’ll need a new tool to help you recruit and onboard new hourly employees, check out Workstream.

The term encompasses the entire process by which employees are hired and integrated into your team. Onboarding starts even before new-hire orientation; it also includes education and training about the business, its mission and vision, and workplace culture and values. Each company’s new employee onboarding plan is different, depending on size, in-person or virtual setup, and what type of work the organization does. Some businesses do this in a day or two of conference-style seminars, individual online classes, or months’ worth of activities with other colleagues. The Basics of Employee Onboarding Every single new employee is onboarded, whether or not you have a structured new employee onboarding plan. When a worker gets the “lay of the land,” so to speak, they’re being onboarded. However, many companies take this to mean only completing paperwork and being shown to their office. New employee onboarding best practices should include much deeper attention and intention so that employees feel welcomed into the folds of the company. They should understand from the start that they are valued and supported—their role is important and they will have the assistance they need to succeed. The Phases of Onboarding Onboarding shouldn’t be confused with orientation, although orientation is often one of the first steps in new employee onboarding best practices. During orientation, the employee completes paperwork and other necessary tasks, but new employee onboarding is more comprehensive and concerns overall training and culture immersion, versus collecting social security numbers and HR-pertinent information. The following are phases of successful new employee onboarding. (Note that orientation might not even be first!) Your company can and should take these as a starting point and individualize them to work for your particular needs. Pre-boarding Pre-boarding consists of engaging the employee after they’ve been hired but before they begin working. This helps make the employee feel welcomed and invested in, and gives them a chance to begin feeling comfortable with all aspects of a company before they are required to perform duties or complete projects. It might include any of the following: Sending a welcome package with company swag Touring the facility Spending time in the area if the employee is relocating (i.e., house hunting, choosing schools for children, community tours, etc.) Educating the employee about benefits programs (e.g., healthcare, retirement) Connecting the employee with a colleague who can answer questions and give them more basic information Onboarding templates Orientation Orientation is the specific session of new employee onboarding in which the person fills out paperwork and gets officially enrolled into the company. It often includes many of the following components: Signing paperwork and getting set up with payroll Reading and committing to following handbook policies and procedures Completing mandatory training Learning about the structure, mission, vision, and values of the company (often through reading literature or engaging in an online course) This phase of the employee onboarding process can be quite overwhelming, so new employee onboarding best practices usually spread this over at least a couple of days if not longer. Foundation Building From an employee engagement perspective, this is possibly the most important phase of new employee onboarding. However, it’s often overlooked once the orientation steps are completed. During foundation building, every new employee develops their understanding of the company’s brand, workplace culture, and shared values. These aren’t always given out directly, either—an employee picks up the information and knowledge piece by piece through varied interactions and experiences. A company ensures that a new employee’s foundation is strong by paying close attention to how they are faring for the first year or so of their employment. The leadership team should follow up with them and engage in conversation surrounding company values, the employees’ strengths and areas of development, and their desired future. Mentoring and Coaching Taking on a new position in a company where you want to be successful can be overwhelming. What do your bosses expect and how are day-to-day situations handled? Who do you go to for those basic questions that seem too small-time for the busy higher-ups? Who can you look to as a partner on your level? Assigning a mentor or a coach gives new employees a “safe space” in which they can feel encouraged and supported without being judged or looked down on for needing help while they transition. This mentor or coach can guide and direct without having to be “in charge” of the new employee. Once an employee feels that they are solidly engaged in the company and their role, perhaps they will want to take on the role of mentoring or coaching someone else. This is a great way for them to feel valued and respected while reaffirming the goals and mission of the company, essentially strengthening their foundation as they grow. Re-boarding This step isn’t always necessary but is especially important for people who have left the company for some time and are returning, or for employees who are transferring to a different division or position within the company. Let’s say someone was out on medical or family leave for a few months. They will need to meet new employees and get up to speed on changed policies or new projects. The company could show their positivity about the return with a welcome back luncheon or gathering, too, to show that they were missed. If an employee is moving into a different division or getting promoted, their reboarding process might include intensive training specific to their new role. They will need to learn about processes in that area of the company and whom they report to as well as who reports to them. This process should include short- and long-term goal-setting and possibly pairing with a mentor or coach again. Important Onboarding Components Successful new employee onboarding (and continued “reboarding” for returning employees) has each of the above steps, but each of those steps is filled with particular qualities that ensure success. The leadership and HR team, as well as the rest of the company, can set an organization up for new employee onboarding success. Preparing ahead of time with focused attention on a few specific areas can mean that your new employees feel welcomed and supported and that the entire team has a positive attitude toward new talent coming on board. Onboarding Is Everyone’s Job If asked, most employees would probably say that new employee onboarding is the job of the boss and the HR department. However, a successful company knows that everyone is a part of the workplace culture, and thus, everyone is a part of teaching new employees how things flow and what the team culture is. An employee onboarding checklist can be crucial so that everyone has the same routine and nothing gets lost in translation when onboarding employees. Unique Onboarding Experiences Although new employee onboarding best practices are key, that doesn’t mean that everyone should have the same experience. Think critically about the role each new employee will have at the company and what their particular needs are. Work with the HR department to create more individualized onboarding practices for particular groups of people or hand-select mentors that show experience in these areas. Managers or executives – These people know how to lead and have had success in this field but they need to know how it applies to the particular organization or division. Remote onboarding – Remote employees don’t have the advantage of seeing people in real life, so a mentor or coach is of even more importance. Differently abled team members – How will they be accommodated and made to feel comfortable asking for help? Military veterans – What support will they receive in transitioning to a civilian role? Second-chance workers – Employees in this category also need extra support and acclimation time, especially when it comes to feeling valued and respected. Onboarding Assessment Onboarding should be a dynamic process. You want to know if your onboarding practices are effective and if people feel supported and engaged from the get-go. Utilize a few of these strategies to get a full, accurate picture of what people experience when coming on board with your company. Time-productivity ratios – How long does it take for an employee to get “situated” and begin producing the work that is equivalent to their salary? The better an onboarding program is, the lower this ratio will be. Turnover and retention rates – How often are you having to onboard new employees because of dissatisfied ones? Are people staying on the team to move into new positions or leaving because they weren’t supported? New employee surveys – Deliver employee engagement surveys throughout the onboarding process and after to get an accurate picture of how people feel and what they need. Informal feedback – Engage in casual conversation and informal check-ins to develop relationships and show that you are invested in an employee’s success and well-being. Final Thoughts New employee onboarding doesn’t have to be difficult. Taking time to prepare your company’s particular new employee onboarding process and regularly assessing its efficacy means you’ll be setting your employees (and your business) up for success.
