It allows them to manage the recruitment process more efficiently and effectively. In this guide, we’ll provide a comprehensive overview of what an ATS is and how it can be used to streamline the hiring process. We’ll also discuss some of the key features you should look for when choosing an ATS. So, if you’re looking to improve your recruitment process, read on! What is an applicant tracking system? An applicant tracking system is an application that helps businesses manage the recruitment process. It’s designed to streamline how companies collect, sort, and track job applications. An ATS can be used to track all aspects of the recruitment process, from initial job postings to final applicant selections. How do applicant tracking systems work? There is no singular ATS that all businesses use. Applicant tracking systems work in different ways depending on the specific software. However, most applicant tracking systems share some common features and functions. These common features include: Data storage Perhaps the most foundational function of an ATS is the storage of applicant information. ATS software is designed to collect and organize applicant data. This data can include everything from contact information, work history, resumes, and cover letters. Applicant tracking systems typically allow employers to search this data using keywords or other criteria. This makes it easier to find qualified applicants when needed. Screening Being able to screen potential applicants effectively is vital when handling large numbers of applications, which means it's important that your applicant tracking system has robust screening capabilities . These features should include: Smart-screening questions Smart-screening questions are mandatory questions within your application that enable you to automatically reject unqualified applicants. Eligibility parameters Eligibility parameters help you identify applicants who meet the minimum requirements for the position, such as \"years of experience\" or \"education level.\" Skill testing Some applicant tracking systems have built-in tests that allow you to assess an applicant’s skills and abilities. These can be helpful for positions that require specific technical skills. Resume-ranking functionality Another vital function that you can expect from your ATS is the ability to rank resumes. Applicants who have applied for a job through an ATS will have their resumes automatically stored in the system. This software will then use predetermined criteria to rank each resume. This criteria can be based on how well the resume stacks up to the job description and requirements. The ATS will also consider things like the applicant's work experience, education, and skills. By ranking resumes, the ATS can help you quickly identify the most qualified applicants for a job. This is a huge time saver as you no longer have to review each and every resume that comes in manually. Reporting Any decent ATS software should provide you with some basic reporting functionality . This includes things like the ability to track how many resumes have been received, how many candidates have been contacted, and how many interviews have been scheduled. This information can be extremely valuable, as it can help you gauge the effectiveness of your recruiting efforts. For example, if you're not receiving many qualified resumes, you may need to adjust your job postings. Or, if you're finding that most applicants are rejected after the first interview, you may want to reconsider your interviewing process. Automation Finally, you can expect your ATS to automate some of the more tedious and time-consuming aspects of recruiting. This can include everything from posting job openings on your website to sending automatic email responses to applicants. By automating these tasks, your ATS can save you a considerable amount of time and effort. This allows you to focus on more important things, like meeting with applicants and making hiring decisions. What are the benefits of using an ATS? Employers and recruiters have been utilizing ATS for years. The best applicant tracking systems have several key benefits: Time-saving Perhaps the main advantage of using an ATS is that it can save you a considerable amount of time and effort. By automating repetitive tasks, an ATS can free up your time so you can focus on more important things like meeting with applicants and making hiring decisions. Improved organization Another benefit of using an ATS is that it can help you better organize your recruitment process. An ATS can store all your applicant information in one centralized location, which makes it easy to keep track of things. Additionally, an ATS can automate things like job postings and email responses, which can help improve how you organize your hiring efforts. Higher quality hires Because an ATS can rank resumes and track applicant information, it can help you identify the best candidates for a job. This, in turn, can lead to higher-quality hires. Increased applicant engagement Finding great applicants isn't worth much if you can't get them to apply for your open positions. However, an ATS can help with this by automatically posting your job openings to multiple job boards and websites. This helps increase the visibility of your open positions and, as a result, can lead to increased applicant engagement. Keep up with the competition An applicant tracking system is almost mandatory if you want to keep up with the competition. This is because more and more employers are using an ATS to streamline their recruitment process. Failure to use an ATS will mean you'll likely be at a disadvantage when competing for top talent, and it can close you off from great hiring opportunities. Improved efficiency One of the main goals of using an applicant tracking system is to improve the efficiency of your recruitment process. An ATS can help you achieve this by automating repetitive tasks and storing applicant information in one centralized location. This makes it easy to find the information you need when you need it, which can save you a lot of time and effort. Reduced costs Finally, you can expect to see a reduction in costs when using an applicant tracking system. As you improve efficiency and cut out much of the unnecessary busy work, you free up time and money that can be spent on more important things like training your staff. What are the features of an ATS? When it comes to applicant tracking systems, there is a wide range of features you can expect , including: Resume screening A feature you can expect with just about any ATS is the ability to screen resumes. This will allow you to filter out resumes that don't match the criteria you need. This filter may be done based on the job description or other screening factors like smart-screening questions . Why this matters: When advertising a role, it's very possible to receive dozens, if not hundreds, of applications. Going through each application manually would be hugely time-consuming. Applicant tracking systems give you the ability to screen resumes quickly and easily. Removing applications that aren't a good match right away means you can focus your time on the most qualified applicants. Keywords A keyword feature allows you to parse through resumes and identify which ones contain the keywords you're looking for. These features also allow you to use negative keywords to avoid looking at resumes that include a keyword you aren't interested in. Why this matters: Many applicant tracking systems now use some form of artificial intelligence (AI) to help screen resumes. However, these systems are still only as good as the keywords you input. This means that it's still important for you to carefully consider the keywords you're using. You'll want to use both positive and negative keywords to make sure you're getting the most accurate results possible. Filters A filtering feature lets you narrow down the pool of applicants by specifying certain criteria. For example, you may want to only look at applicants who can work and live within a certain radius of the job location. Why this matters: The filtering feature is one of the most powerful features offered by applicant tracking systems. It's great for categorizing types of applications, as well as finding the very best match for a job opening. Automated emails One feature that applicant tracking systems offer is the ability to automate email communications. This means you can set up automatic responses after you receive a resume, when an applicant moves to the next stage of the process, and so on. Why this matters: Automated email communications can help keep your applicants updated on the status of their applications as well as the next steps they should expect. This can be a great way to improve communication and keep your applicants informed throughout the process. Advanced analytics Some applicant tracking systems also offer advanced analytics features . This can include things like being able to see what sources your best applicants are coming from or predicting how long it will take to fill a role. Why this matters: Advanced analytics can be a helpful way to get insights into your recruiting process. This information can be used to improve your process as well as make more informed decisions about your hiring. CRM software Many applicant tracking systems have CRM (customer relationship management) software built in. This allows you to engage your potential applicants directly via the system rather than needing to rely on external tools like email. Why this matters: CRM software can be a great way to keep track of your potential applicants and engage with them directly. This can help you build relationships, keep your applicants interested in the role, and ensure communication lines never fall through the cracks. The last thing you want is to miss out on a great applicant because you forgot to respond to an email. Applicant pool sourcing An applicant pool sourcing feature allows you to retain information and data from potential candidates even if they don't get offered the role for which they originally applied. This allows you to grow your applicant pool and contact individuals for future roles that may be a better match. Why this matters: Not every good applicant will get the job. But that doesn’t mean you can’t hire them later for a different role. Applicant sourcing features allow you to build a pool of potentially great candidates who may be perfect for an upcoming position. These tools are also built with compliance in mind since data storage is a sensitive issue. Integrations The best ATS should be able to integrate with your existing HR software. This allows you to have all your applicant data in one place and makes it easy to keep track of. Why this matters: Having a system that can integrate with your other HR software is important for keeping all of your applicant data in one place. This can make it easier to keep track of and ensure that you're not duplicating data entry. Onboarding Finally, many applicant tracking systems offer an onboarding feature. This means you can use the system to help new hires get acclimated to their new role and company. This can include things like collecting new hire paperwork, setting up training programs, or sending out welcome emails. Why this matters: Onboarding is an important part of the recruiting process and can help ensure new hires are successful in their roles. Having a system that can help with this can be a great way to improve your onboarding process. Drawbacks of using an ATS While ATS software is a fantastic tool to help recruiters and employers bring in talent, there are a few potential drawbacks to using applicant tracking systems. Cost The cost of the software, as well as the subscription fees, can add up quickly. Additionally, applicant tracking systems can require a significant time and resource investment to set up and maintain. Complexity Applicant tracking systems can be complex and require a certain level of technical expertise to set up and use. This can make it difficult for small businesses and startups to get started using applicant tracking systems. Inaccurate results Algorithms are not perfect. When your applicant tracking system uses a less reliable algorithm to select applicants, you may mistake a well-qualified candidate for a less qualified one. This can lead to good applicants slipping through the cracks and a potentially bad candidate experience . Lack of human touch Because ATS programs are automated, they lack the human touch that is so important in the hiring process. This can lead to a feeling of disconnection between applicants and employers. This could also lead applicants to feel disconnected from your business. Similarly, you may end up with an applicant who is good on paper but clashes with the ethos and culture of your company. ATSs are becoming more and more commonplace in the recruiting landscape. However, it's important to be aware of the potential drawbacks of using applicant tracking systems before deciding whether to use one or not. How accurate are applicant tracking systems? As it stands, ATSs are very accurate when you account for just how much data they work through. They can help narrow down an applicant pool to a manageable list of qualified candidates in a relatively short amount of time. However, there are a couple of caveats. Firstly, they struggle to differentiate between similar candidates. This is because ATSs are automated systems that rely on algorithms to sort and select candidates. These algorithms are not perfect and can sometimes make mistakes. This can lead to good applicants being overlooked or even rejected outright. Secondly, ATSs are not human and cannot replace the personal touch that is so important in recruiting. They can help narrow down an applicant pool and save time, but they should not be used as a replacement for human interaction. They cannot interview applicants, nor can they assess competence or character. Finally, the results you get are only as good as the data you input. This means that applicant tracking systems can only be as accurate as the information you give them. If there are errors in your data, the applicant tracking system will make errors in its assessment. For these reasons, it's important to use applicant tracking systems as one part of your recruiting process. They can be valuable tools, but they should not be the only tool you use. Applicant tracking systems should be used in conjunction with other methods, such as personal networking, referrals, and job boards. How to ensure success when implementing an ATS As it should now be clear, there are enormous benefits to using applicant tracking systems as long as you set yourself up for success. Recognize why you need an ATS What is the exact problem you need to solve? Success will come when the applicant tracking system complements your current recruitment strategy. Trying to fix what isn't broken will only lead to frustration. Get buy-in from all stakeholders An applicant tracking system can only be as successful as the people using it. This means that you'll need to get buy-in from everyone who will be using the system. This includes managers, recruiters, and even the IT team. Have a plan for data migration An applicant tracking system will only be as good as the data you put into it. This means you'll need to have a plan for migrating your data into the system. This can be a time-consuming process, but it's essential for success. Summary Incorporating an applicant tracking system can be the difference between a successful hiring process and a frustrating one. It can save you time and money while also improving the quality of your hires.

After being closed for so long, businesses are scurrying to get everything ready to open their doors to customers once again. And one of THE biggest challenges is to hire the best talent. The total number of unemployment claims filed in the last two months have exceeded 36 million . This would mean that the size of the talent pool from which businesses will be hiring from is huge. To that end, HR managers will need to have the right hiring tools at their disposal, with features that facilitate and streamline the process. Especially in times when businesses in the country are preparing to reopen and hire from an incredibly large talent pool, hiring solutions used need to be very fast and efficient to capture the best talent. With that in mind, what are some of the best features to look out for when searching for the right apps or platforms to use? 1. Ability to Cast a Wide Net You’ll want to look out for hiring software that allows you to reach out to as many people as possible. We constantly hear from our potential customers that they manually post  job openings to each and every job board out there, all while using an Excel sheet to keep track of this process and the number of people who’ve applied. This process is not only time-consuming, it can be very confusing and tedious to keep track of every single applicant. Workstream’s hiring platform is integrated with 24 different job boards. With a click of a button, you post your job opening to all the free job boards integrated with our platform , making Workstream the ultimate applicant sourcing tool. This helps hiring managers save a ton of time - hours that can be well-spent on other day-to-day tasks. 2. Organized Dashboard Once you’ve cast your net into the pool of eager applicants, you’ll need tools to help you organize the large volume of applications you receive. Given the varied amounts and types of information you need to be able to quickly retrieve, Excel sheets simply won’t cut it. As a hiring manager, you need to be able to know these ASAP: How many positions have I posted and for which locations? How many people have applied for jobs I posted? How many people are at which stage of the hiring process? How many hires have we made so far and at which locations? Many of our clients have mentioned this concern to us in the past, and we created a dashboard to suit their needs. As you can see below, Workstream’s central dashboard provides easy access to the important numbers and statistics you need to track hiring progress. 3. Automation If you’ve not caught on by now, the keyword here is “quick.” The hiring tool you should utilize must be quick in its sourcing and quick in providing you with necessary information. What else? Automated Text Messaging - Reminders and Replies Candidates not showing up for interviews is one of the biggest problems businesses face when hiring new talent. Time is wasted as hiring managers communicate back and forth with the interview candidates to arrange interview schedules. Even more time is lost when the HR team spends time waiting for the applicant, only for them to not show up. To combat this issue, we created an automated text messaging function where Workstream users can customize an a utomated text message to be sent out to remind candidates about their interviews . Hollenback Palms and Dream Dinners managed to reduce their no-show rates by 66% and 67% respectively. Automated Progression Across Hiring Stages Workstream users can customize their hiring stages to include screening questions which automatically filter out any applicant who does not meet the criteria . For example, if you are hiring for kitchen staff with experience and you include a question that asks for that, someone who answers the question with a ‘no’ will automatically be rejected for the job. The candidate will even receive an automatic message explaining why he or she was rejected. This can greatly improve the candidate experience. 4. Rounding Up Before all businesses across the states receive the green light to start reopening, you need to be ready with the ultimate HR solution that not only organizes but streamlines your hiring process. With millions of potential employees out there, the only way to stand out is by moving quickly to acquire the best talent for your business. Workstream’s end-to-end hiring software enables you to customize, automate, and organize your hiring process in a way that suits your specific needs . Many customers have achieved hiring success with us and we would love to help you achieve those same results. Schedule a chat with us today!

Three winners were announced , each earning $5000 and the opportunity to prototype their designs to see if they can work. Let's check out each of the three winning designs. Cozy Cabins was the winning concept designed by ASD | SKY, a creative design firm. Their concept for modular dining \"cabins\" that can potentially fit three to a single parking space basically acts as a private room for restaurant patrons. It's stylish, comfortable, and can definitely withstand the elements during winter. However, it also seems like the most expensive option. Depending on the materials used (the entry calls for \"wood, corrugated metal, polycarbonate plastic\"), building and maintaining these cabins during the winter months will be a challenge for stores with tight budgets. The plan also calls for radiant heating floors, overhead lighting, and transparent windows. And if you're wondering \"isn't the point of outdoor dining to be in open air to prevent COVID-19 spread?\", this concept addresses that issue with vents near the ceiling... which is strange since if that's all it takes to stay safe, then restaurants can just install HVAC systems inside their current indoor space. Or carve out more air vents. That may cost money, but we're not sure if this solution would be any less expensive. It just seems like, well, more indoor seating. It may even be cheaper to build plexiglass partitions indoors with their own vent systems, basically mimicking these cabins inside the space a restaurant would already have. Heated Tables , by Ellie Henderson, is a take on a Japanese Kotatsu which is, you guessed it, a heated table. In essence, special heaters are bolted to the underside of a table, then the entire table is draped with a heavy blanket to retain the heat. Guests would stay mostly warm by putting their lower half under the blanket as they ate outdoors. As popular as they are in Japan, they are mostly used indoors for good reason. Not only do they need to be plugged in, but they only warm the lower half of the body. Also, for best results, guests would have to sit on pillows or cushions on the floor as chairs may not be suitable to retain heat, even if the blankets were long enough to drape to the floor. On the bright side, it's probably the most affordable solution. Kotatsu heaters can be bolted to nearly any existing table, and it's a low-cost way to keep guests mostly warm during the colder months, especially if there are a few standing heaters around the space as well. The only other concern is all these heating elements being a possible fire or burn hazard that might not fly with restaurant management, or city safety inspectors. Block Party , submitted by Neil Reindel, sort of straddles between the two previous ideas. These blocks are open-air modular seating squares that can accommodate two people, and more can be pushed together for larger parties. There are overhead lights, and radiant heating mesh built into the seats. The materials also seem less expensive than the previous modular device. To us, this seems like the best solution. It takes the modular, shielded elements of the first idea and decreases cost while increasing actual air circulation. Sure, during a particularly windy day, they might not be suitable to use, but no outdoor solution that requires open-air seating will be. At least this idea seems more affordable for restaurants trying to salvage just a few more seating opportunities in a strange, COVID winter. Which is your favorite concept? We're excited to see what happens as Chicago prototypes each of these and hopefully bring them to a restaurant near you. In Other News... 33% of SMBs are Struggling to Hire Despite the unemployment rate hovering around 8%, a recent report from the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) showed that 33% of SMBs have at least one unfilled position ; and in general, job openings have increased three points since their previous report. Why are so many companies struggling to hire employees during this time? There are a few reasons. Unemployed, But Not Looking One factor is that many people considered \"unemployed\" are not really looking for work due to various reason. Some are related to health, as many are afraid to expose themselves to the ongoing pandemic. Another is that they are technically furloughed, so many are expecting to be able to return to their old job, effectively preventing them from finding a new one. And disturbingly, 1 in 4 women are considering downshifting or leaving the workforce during this time, many for familial reasons. All this means that while unemployment is high, there are significant barriers that make hiring difficult for many small and medium sized businesses. Skilled Labor is an Ongoing Issue In February, America was seeing historically low unemployment and the demand for skilled workers was especially high. The pandemic changed many things, but it seems like this demand hasn't dipped much at all. In short, most skilled workers have remained employed, and businesses can't find enough of them to hire even now. According to the NFIB report, \"construction job growth continues to be strong but owners in the sector are having a particularly hard time finding skilled employees.\" Likewise, the tech industry is struggling to hire skilled programmers. The wave of unemployment hit skill-levels unequally, and the SMBs in need of experienced employees are finding hiring them just as difficult as it was pre-pandemic. Increased Enterprise Competition Nearly every week, we're seeing announcements of mass hirings by giant brands like Amazon or Walmart. In some ways, this economic downturn has been a boon to these enterprise-level companies who have deep pockets and the infrastructure to scoop up tens of thousands of employees at a time, with fairly competitive salaries and benefits. Often, SMBs can't match what they're paying, but more often, they can't match their hiring efficiency. When Amazon can hire thousands of applicants within days using a completely automated process , that puts SMBs at a major disadvantage in sourcing employees. This is why more SMBs are using automated hiring solutions themselves in order to compete with the big brands, especially during the seasonal uptick we're starting to see now. Hiring, even during high unemployment, is a tricky endeavor for many businesses. Make sure you understand the reasons why filling positions are difficult so you can address them as you plan out your hiring funnel and process. Need help hiring the right people?

As of March 19, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has reached over 13,000 - leaving many businesses devastated amidst emergency lockdown. After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that mass gatherings be cancelled or postponed over the next two months, numerous states announced the closure of places like bars, movie theaters, and even schools. Restaurants were made to close their doors to dine-in customers, or at the very least reduce their occupancy levels. Here’s a list of states that have implemented this ruling: California - Restaurants are enjoined to reduce occupancy by half , and impose social distancing by keeping tables at least 6 feet apart. Some cities in the state have gone one step further, such as Los Angeles, limiting services to only takeout or delivery . Colorado - All restaurants here have suspended dine-in services for 30 days starting last March 17. For Denver, the restriction will be in place until May 11. Connecticut, New Jersey, New York - Governors of the three states addressed reporters in a joint conference call last March 16, stating that restaurants in their tri-state area will close doors to dine-in customers . Florida - Restaurants must reduce dine-in customers by 50% . Hawaii - Takeout, drive-thru, and delivery options are permissible where applicable. Illinois - 250,000 bars and restaurants across the state are no longer accepting dine-in customers. Indiana - Only takeout and delivery services are permitted until the end of March. Iowa - Aside from limiting gatherings to a maximum of only 10 people , the state has also banned dine-in transactions for restaurants. Kentucky - Restaurants are allowed to continue takeout, drive-thru, and delivery services, under the condition that social distancing of 6 feet must be maintained . Louisiana - Dine-in services may be offered on April 13 , depending on whether the coronavirus situation has improved. The decision will be reevaluated prior to these services being reinstated. Maryland - Dine-in services are suspended for all restaurants, with the exception of eateries catering to health care facilities . Massachusetts - Restaurants can no longer offer dine-in services until April 7 . Michigan - Dine-in services are suspended statewide, while only up to 5 customers at a time are allowed to stay in restaurants while waiting for their takeout. Minnesota - Dine-in restaurants in this state will remain closed until March 27. Nevada - Nonessential businesses were given two options : provide delivery, drive-thru, or takeout OR close their doors. North Carolina - Restaurants can no longer offer sit-down service , and the same goes for groceries, convenience stores, and gas stations. Ohio - Only takeout and delivery options are available in this state, indefinitely. “It will be in effect as long as it needs to,” declared Gov. DeWine . Oregon - The state has banned dine-in services for all establishments , as well as gatherings of more than 25 people. Pennsylvania - Sit-down services have been banned for two weeks in 5 of its most populous counties : Montgomery, Delaware, Bucks, Chester, and Allegheny. The state will reevaluate its decision after the first 14 days have passed. Rhode Island - Restaurants and coffee shops will not be offering dine-in services until March 20. South Carolina - Customers can avail of takeout and delivery services only . Texas - Dine-in services will be suspended statewide until at least April 3 . Utah - The governor suspended dine-in operations for at least two weeks , starting on March 18. Vermont - On-site services will not be available throughout the state until April 6. Virginia - The state calls on its citizens to avoid gathering of more than 10 people, and for restaurants to only provide takeout options . Washington - Food businesses are encouraged to close dine-in services , including cafes, doughnut shops, and food halls on college campuses. Wisconsin - Customers can only avail of takeout or delivery services throughout the state. Quick Tips for Restaurant Owners: Make sure delivery drivers have safety kits. These could contain (but are not limited to) sanitary wipes, alcohol sprays, tissues, and gloves. Sanitize kitchen workstations and high-touch areas in between crew shifts to limit transmissions. Offer contactless delivery to better ensure safety of your delivery crew. Take credit card information or tip amount by phone so that no further contact between customer and driver is needed. Regularly sanitize all thermal bags, vehicles, or food containers used in deliveries. Partner with reputable food delivery services for hassle-free logistics. Reduce size of kitchen staff to help promote distancing, or stagger shifts.

The founder’s love for Chicago street food materialized into a physical sandwich shop, which once stood as a two-car garage. With rigorous hard work and a systemic process, Jimmy John’s managed to flourish into the sandwich chain that it is today. Currently, the quick-service restaurant (QSR) has over 2,800 outlets in the US and is widely known for the fresh ingredients used in its sandwiches. With Jimmy John’s, it is not only their delivery that is expeditious. Their online site is also proven to be one of the fastest among QSRs. Despite its reputation, Jimmy John’s was not spared from the trials and tribulations caused by the pandemic last year. Read on to uncover how they overcame the hurdle and still stay true to their famed branding of being freaky fast! Campaigns Around “Freaky Fast” Slogan When Jimmy John’s came up with their “Freaky Fresh! Freaky Fast!” tagline, they were not playing around. The sandwich chain is dedicated to giving their customers the freshest sandwiches in the shortest time possible. It is even rumored that it may take longer for you to make the order online than for it to arrive at your doorstep. Impressive, isn’t it? By leveraging mass media, Jimmy John’s came up with a few campaigns to show the country how they could pull off their freaky fast deliveries. And in the most creative ways possible. Freak Yeah Campaign In 2018, Jimmy John’s organized a national television campaign advertising their ‘freaky’ employees preparing the perfect sandwich alongside their new menu items. Why are they described as freaky? Because only freaks will be as obsessed as they are with making the freshest sandwich at the fastest speed. Believing that their employees are their most valuable assets, Jimmy John’s chose to focus on them for this campaign. And understandably so - their staff are well-trained so that they can make a sandwich, customized or not, in 30 seconds or less. After all, that is the only way customers are able to get their orders freaky fast. Through the different advertisements, viewers get a comedic peek into some of the most important processes that come into making a Jimmy John’s sandwich. John Shea, Jimmy John's Chief Marketing Officer, hopes that by launching this campaign nationwide, their brand will leave a significant impression on areas where the brand is less-known. Sandwich Delivery Zones Another campaign that highlights their freaky fast delivery was the unveiling of the brand’s sandwich delivery zones. This was launched a month after the sandwich chain vowed to “ never use third-party delivery ” services as these companies usually do not meet the delivery standards in which Jimmy John’s has set for themselves. To ensure customers get their fresh orders promptly, the zone only covers areas that are within 5 minutes away from the store. While this also means that people who fall outside this zone are not eligible for deliveries, it ensures that those who are served, get a better sandwich. The advertisements , called “Hard Stop” and “Drawing the Line”, each showcased imaginative ways in which deliverers are restricted within the delivery zones. Nevertheless, the sandwich chain made sure to not leave out fans who stay outside the zone. In August 2019, they announced a contest where the winner gets a house located within the radius so they can get some of that freaky fast sandwich deliveries. One thing’s for sure - Jimmy John’s is indeed freaky dedicated! Adapting to the COVID-19 Pandemic Partnering with DoorDash The QSR industry saw a drastic rise in the number of home deliveries as families and individuals became increasingly wary of stepping outside their homes during the pandemic. While many QSRs were grappling with the lack of dine-in customers, Jimmy John’s was unintentionally well prepared given that they had their very own fleet of delivery drivers . In fact, Jimmy John’s employs about 45,000 delivery drivers at its 2,800+ locations which definitely helped their sales during the pandemic. Despite previously announcing that they would never employ a third-party delivery service, Jimmy John’s did eventually partner up with DoorDash to utilize the latter’s self-delivery product. However, this only means that Jimmy John’s will be using DoorDash’s platform to receive orders. This increases their visibility to consumers since they are now tapping into a new market of users. As for the fulfillment of orders, the sandwich chain will still be using their own delivery fleet to ensure their reputable standards are not affected. Expansion of Product Offerings Needless to say, the demand for grocery items rose as people started panic-buying and stocking up to prepare for the worst. While this may seem morbid, it creates an opportunity for restaurants to offer items that are running out of stock in grocery stores. According to a study by Datassential , 72% of consumers are likely to purchase bread or bakery items from restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic. And this was what Jimmy John’s did. The brand introduced Freaky Fresh Bread on Demand where consumers can purchase their freshly baked french loaves for delivery or pick-up, which includes curbside and drive-thru. By doing so, they are ensuring that safe distancing measures are kept in place while responding to their consumers’ changing needs. Hiring the Right Employees With a reputation such as Jimmy John’s, it is no doubt that the employees working in the restaurant play a huge role in bringing the brand to where it is today. Rigorous training is provided to ensure that the staff is able to prepare a sandwich at its finest quality and within the acceptable time frame. Notably, delivery drivers must also possess the right attitude so that the end-to-end food service provided by Jimmy John’s is impeccable. It is fair to say that having good employees can make or break your company and the importance of hiring the right individuals can never be emphasized any further. At Workstream , we can help you find quality hourly workers easily through smart screening so that you do not have to go through every resume that you receive. Screening questions are also highly customizable and the whole process is automated to save you precious time! Jimmy John’s ‘Freaky Fresh!’ And ‘Freaky Fast!’ reputation is not achieved overnight. It required years of hard work and strict discipline to ensure that standards are held at the highest level. Even with the pandemic, they were able to stay true to their branding by adapting their strategies to meet the new needs of the consumers. If you are a franchise owner, remember to hire the right employees as they will be the ones helping you upkeep the reputation of your brand. With the right training, your restaurant may well be on its way to being as successful as Jimmy John’s! Not sure how to find the right employee for your company? Don’t fret!

Is it just me, or is it a bit strange to watch a movie and see strangers shaking hands as they meet? During this time of the coronavirus pandemic, that simple gesture isn’t going to be a part of job interviews or hiring any time soon. COVID-19 has quickly ushered in a new era of contactless hiring and onboarding for businesses looking to recruit talent. While large tech companies may have already mastered virtual interviews and training over the last decade, many smaller companies are now finding themselves grappling with this new reality. So here are some general tips that businesses of any size can employ to better handle contactless hiring and onboarding. 1. Make video interviews one click As every industry puts in-person job interviews on hold and pivots to video, many employers are ignoring the KISS principle . Some companies are forcing interviewees to use complicated video chat apps that often involve either downloading a new app or program to their devices. While this might be fine for interviewing for a tech-savvy position, it can be a hassle for many others who may not have the right device or aptitude with software. And for hiring large numbers of entry-level or hourly workers (ie. grocery workers), any barrier to entry can cause prospective employees to skip out on the interview process, leaving you with a higher no-show rate. To combat this, make logging onto video interviews as one-click as possible. If the candidate doesn’t have to download anything new, that’s preferable. Also keep in mind that the best device many will have are their mobile phones, so pick a platform that works great on smartphones. Zoom might be the most well known, but test out what else may work for your needs and audience. Google Meet is a convenient option. Anyone with an iPhone has Facetime, and you can use it with your company email instead of your phone number. Finally, don’t just include the meeting link in a calendar invite. Texting the link can make it much simpler for candidates to click from their devices at the appropriate time. And remember to brush up on your video interviewing technique before starting. 2. Have a methodology to send, receive, and store virtual documents. For decades, people have been saying we’re headed toward a paperless office and this pandemic might be what pushes us into that reality. With virtual hiring, candidates will have to receive and send back signed paperwork multiple times. Sure, you can email them a PDF to print out and sign and scan and email back… but there are better ways of doing it. A simple way to get virtual paperwork done is to create editable PDFs that both you and your new hires can fill in with many PDF readers, even on their mobile device ( which are free on their end ). This way, there is no printing and rescanning involved. Once you receive these forms, save them in virtual folders for each employee and always, always create a backup that lives on a secure cloud server. Too many times, important employee files have been lost due to a single drive failure, causing headaches for everyone involved. A more robust way is to use a hiring platform that allows you to electronically send and manage all your offer letters, HR docs, W-2 or W-4 documents, etc. This is a more hands-off approach since practically everything is automated, leaving less room for human error. 3. Use training videos to onboard. Virtual onboarding is all about creating and distributing good training videos to your new employees. And yes, they are effective. A study showed that videos were more effective than reading materials for training and refreshing/reinforcing purposes. While there is no replacement for in-person, hands-on training, training videos are often the next best thing. Creating quality training videos can be an entire ebook in of itself. There are a lot of factors that make videos engaging and actually educational, instead of boring new hires. But there are a few key tips to keep in mind: Keep them short and to the point. In the study linked above, videos under 15 minutes were recommended. 5-10 minutes is the sweet spot. You’d be surprised just how much information you can pack into a five-minute video if the video is well thought-out. Keep it interactive. The more engaging the onboarding process can be, the better. Perhaps you don’t have the ability to create interactive videos at the moment. At the very least, having a live virtual meeting to discuss training modules with other coworkers can provide much needed interaction. Keep them accountable. For best training, and not to mention legal reasons, it’s important to keep hires accountable to complete their onboarding. Post-video quizzes and signed statements of training completion are a must. If your platform prevents videos from being skipped forward, use this option. 4. Establish communication and a sense of team quickly. Starting a new job at a new company can feel isolating when you can’t physically meet your supervisor or teammates. Remote workers tend to not “buy in” to company spirit and culture due to this perceived disconnect. This is a more serious matter than many business owners realize. A lack of loyalty can make your turnover rate skyrocket unless you put in the effort to make people feel like they are part of the team. Establish open communications with new hires right away. This can be a Slack channel during the work day, to holding “office hours” if they have any questions for you as they get started. Telling them, “Hey, I’ll be available during Friday lunch if you want to do a quick video call about anything,” can go a long way to establishing trust and camaraderie. For team bonding, informal video hangouts at the end of the week can be useful depending on the sort of company culture you want to establish. Or, consider sending out “welcome boxes” with some physical company merch when they come onboard. Companies today are getting creative by sending out dinner kits and cooking together, or sending mixology kits and learning to make cocktails together. The more you can make the virtual feel not as virtual, the more these new onboarded employees can become a trusted part of your team.

After a certain world-changing event in 2001, the airline industry changed forever. One thing we remember are the temporary food and beverage kiosks in all the airports that were suddenly necessary when non-ticketed guests could no longer go past security. It took years to change the layout of airports to accommodate a new normal, and those kiosks were the transition stopgaps until the airport upgrades of today. Similarly, COVID-19 is forcing both the physical establishment of restaurants and how they operate to change. What are the changes we expect to see a few years from now? Let's dust off the crystal ball and predict the future of restaurants. Physical menus disappearing - 99% chance Restaurants won't be keen on disposable menus (cost, waste) or sanitizing them between uses. Expect QR codes that customers can scan with their phones and big, flat screen menus to be the new normal in most places. Upgraded HVAC systems - 85% chance While outdoor patios have been a stopgap measure for many locations during the past few months, not every restaurant has access to the extra space. We expect new constructions to add some more outdoor seating, but it's just not feasible for existing locations, especially ones that have to deal with harsh winters. Even in California, offering outdoor seating isn't easy , having to deal with the heat and bad air. Instead, we expect to see a big uptick in locations upgrading their HVAC systems. Advanced ones that can literally pull and filter viruses out of the air or kill viruses with UV light are already selling quickly, despite high price tags of $10,000 to $50,000. Expect restaurants to use these fancy HVACs in their marketing as well, to entice the dubious population to come back and eat inside. Ghost Kitchens - 70% chance With people wary of indoor spaces, less income, and a new familiarity with eating in; we expect take out and delivery to be a big part of the dining experience for the next couple years at least. Savvy owners will go where the money is and double down on food-to-go, while cutting back on the overhead of dine-in spaces. Hence ghost kitchens will be much more popular for both established franchises like Wingstop , as well as new business that only do take out and delivery. It's possible that food trucks will become even more popular than they already are, since this has been their purview all along. There will always be the need for traditional dine-in places, but we expect a big surge in ghost kitchens in the future. Contactless everything - 60% chance Menus are one thing, but what about payment systems? Door handles? Anything in the bathroom? Customers will want to touch as few things in public as possible (which is why these things are selling so well ) and the more contactless options there are, the safer they will feel. Will restaurants invest in such things? It's not as clear cut. As more science comes out about COVID-19, it seems surface transmission is very small ; it's really just a respiratory virus. So, much like x-raying your shoes at the airport, going full contactless may turn out to be just a \"show of safety\" more than anything else. That being said, going contactless isn't just good for COVID-19; various other nasties like bacteria and E. coli and the flu can be stopped. So it's not a bad thing at all to go contactless. But we're not sure COVID-19 alone will be the trigger for mass adoption since it's expensive to do so. Partitioned tables - 20% chance A current stopgap measure some locations are taking is putting Plexiglas between tables and low booths. We don't expect these types of obvious barriers to exist in the future as they are unsightly and unconducive to the lively atmosphere of a restaurant. Instead, we expect more elegant solutions to barriers and social distancing. More two-tops, less standing room by the bar (to discourage crowds), higher booth walls, and less seating in general. Many Korean restaurants already have private rooms for larger groups of people. It's possible that American restaurants will have private rooms for parties of 8 or more in the future. Automated hiring solutions - 100% chance Just a hunch on our part. In Other News... How hiring is about to change. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the job market for multiple generations of workers, both those with decades of experience under their belts and young adults just entering the workforce. Because of this, hiring managers now have a harder time than ever staffing: just because there are more to choose from, doesn't mean it's any easier. And some traditional ideas on hiring will be changed for the foreseeable future. Let's dive into just a few looming changes in hiring we see coming our way. Hiring in big cities may get harder due to an exodus \"Big City Exodus\" has been a hot topic lately. Wealthy people are getting out of dodge to their summer homes, or at least to less populated spaces. Millennials are leaving cities like Chicago for the suburbs. Right now, this is in large part due to the high cost of living and the lack of jobs. But when the pandemic ends and jobs rebound, will there be enough people to fill those opening in these newly emptied-out cities? Bloomberg doesn't think it's a given that big cities will rebound (to be fair, it's an opinion piece). With more remote work than ever and an increasingly disillusioned generation of Millennials looking for cheaper housing, businesses based in cities like New York may have a severe shortage of candidates in the coming years. Some research shows that these exodus concerns are overblown , but the longer the pandemic continues, the harder it will be to hire quickly in big cities. Hiring will be more about skills than experience This won't be a blanket approach, but many businesses will use this opportunity in a unique job market to hire less expensive workers who may not have the years, but have the skill set that they want. A recent Gazette business panel discussed the benefits of this approach, not only to diversify their employees, but to give opportunities to young adults who spent quarantine shoring up their skills and are eager to work. In fact, many Americans will have a COVID-19-sized gap in their resume, and savvy hiring managers will be able to get skilled workers on a discount as the job market recovers. It's also a way for smaller cities to fill open jobs, hiring recent grads with the right skill set instead of those with more experience. Hiring managers will use job security as a selling point A traumatized workforce has seen how quickly their jobs can be taken away from them. From layoffs to furloughs to re-opens & re-closings in the same month, it's never been more unnerving to be an hourly worker, or even a salaried employee, when it comes to job security. Hiring managers can push this as part of their employer value proposition, building in language around job security into their job postings and their pitch to the candidate. This could be highlighting the essential nature of the job, or how low the layoff percentage was during the pandemic, or employee protections like paid sick leave and even pandemic insurance. A good hourly rate or salary is one thing, but now many employers will have another lever to pull when promoting a job opening at their company. Hiring will get faster This pandemic is giving businesses the perfect reason to invest into remote interviewing and onboarding, and many are opting to not do it piecemeal by just picking up video conferencing software, but instead streamlining their entire hiring process under one automated solution like Workstream . We're seeing more adoption among the businesses that are currently hiring big during the past few months such as Quick Service Restaurants, and we are seeing the pace of hiring speed up due to this. And now that they know how fast they can hire, which provides an edge over their competition, this is a permanent change. In a few years, businesses with a backlogged recruitment process will end up chronically understaffed and under-skilled as they miss out on the best candidates. Need help hiring the right people?

And, as a restaurant owner, that means you need to be thinking about marketing strategies that will help your business thrive over the holidays. But with the COVID-19 pandemic still ongoing, the marketing ideas you once had may not be as effective as they used to be. That’s why we’re sharing six of our favorite holiday marketing ideas for restaurants in 2021! Best of all, we believe these ideas can work for any restaurant, regardless of your marketing budget. Here’s a quick preview of those six ideas: Go festive offline and online Create festive menus and promotions Offer holiday gift cards and vouchers Run a catering service Organize holiday events Give back to the community We’ll share more about how to best implement each one. But, before we do, let’s answer two questions that will help you plan your holiday marketing strategies. How Can Restaurants Use Holidays to Boost Sales in 2021? You already know that during the holidays people tend to come together to eat, drink, and celebrate. For example, companies usually host end-of-year parties and families gather for reunions. But you also know that with the pandemic, a lot of those gatherings are looking a little different than they used to. And, to boost sales during this time, you’ll need to be strategic when planning your holiday marketing. The good news? It’s likely to pay off. According to a report from Deloitte, in 2021 holiday retail sales are likely to increase between 7-9% when compared to the 2020 holiday season. And, yes, this forecast includes restaurants! So, it’s good you’re here to make sure you grab a slice of this holiday profit pie! But which of the upcoming holidays are most worth your time and effort? Let’s take a look. Which Holidays are Best for Restaurants to Offer Promotions? As we’re already at the end of 2021, there are three holidays in particular that you should aim to capitalize on by creating unique dine-in or takeaway experiences to market to your customers. Black Friday When you think about Black Friday, you likely focus on the brick-and-mortar shopping experience. And that’s because retailers usually offer discounts so huge that customers come to stores in record numbers that nearly always make the news. As a result, Black Friday is regularly regarded as one of the biggest retail sales events. Retailers made a total of $7.4 billion in sales during Black Friday in 2019 . As we’ll show later on, you can join the craze and cash in on the sales potential of this holiday as a restaurant owner by marketing different deals and promotions. When is Black Friday? Black Friday is the Friday following Thanksgiving Day. This year, it's November 26th. Small Business Saturday Small Business Saturday is a day dedicated to celebrating small businesses. While less known than Black Friday, consumers are encouraged to shop locally on this day—something many consumers are hoping to do in 2021. According to Groupon, 75% of consumers are looking forward to supporting small businesses as we move into the “new normal.” If your restaurant is a small business, make sure consumers know! When is Small Business Saturday? Small Business Saturday is the Saturday following Black Friday. This year, it’s November 27th. New Year's Eve According to FSR Magazine, New Year’s Eve is one of the busiest holidays for restaurants . And, with the right planning, your restaurant could be a part of how people ring in the new year! 6 Restaurant Marketing Ideas to Boost Sales During the Holidays Of course, COVID-19 has changed how we celebrate the holidays. But there are several marketing ideas that could still help you to thrive and improve your restaurant operations before the end of the year. Here are six of our favorites. #1 Go Festive Offline and Online First thing first: make sure you create a festive mood in your restaurant! Turn on the music (include pop songs like \"Oh Santa\" by Mariah Carey ) and put up the appropriate decorations. You don’t have to go over the top, but make sure you have the basics.  For example, if you are decorating for Christmas, at least put up a Christmas tree with lights. Does this really matter? Yep! Experts say that, for many, putting up decorations evokes feelings of excitement and nostalgia . Your customers may come to associate these positive feelings with your restaurant, even if they are just there for take out. Online, keep the festive mood going. Update your website to reflect holidays and line up posts on your social media about the holiday specials you have in store. If you have a mailing list, consider sending subscribers an e-greeting card. #2 Create Festive Menus and Promotions Millions of customers eat out during holidays, including Thanksgiving! So, curating festive menus could bring in additional sales for your restaurant. For example, you could combine some of your menu items to create festive family meals. Starbucks is the pioneer of creating seasonal offerings . Not only do they set up in-store Christmas decorations right away, but they also offer special, festive beverages and takeaway cups exclusively for this time of year. This marketing strategy works by creating anticipation among customers who love their products. #3 Offer Holiday Gift Cards and Vouchers If you haven’t already done this, you should do it now. Research from Blackhawk Network says that 83% of the consumers want to give gift cards instead of physical gifts this year. Plus, restaurant gift cards are a profitable and convenient way to expand your customer base. Include information about how customers can purchase gift cards in your online and offline holiday marketing campaigns. You should also train your staff to upsell holiday gift cards and vouchers to customers—especially on Black Friday and Small Business Saturday. And don’t forget that, because we’re still living through the pandemic, it’s also a smart idea to sell digital gift vouchers that customers can purchase entirely online. #4 Run a Catering Service Social distancing restrictions are not as strict as they used to be. But that doesn’t mean everyone who wants to celebrate the holidays with your restaurant is comfortable dining in. Offering a catering service could be a great solution for those who want to have parties without having to share space with strangers. You might also consider engaging with companies whose employees are still working from home. Those companies might want to replace their usual in-person holiday parties with something more remote-friendly. For example, you could offer to prepare and deliver individual festival boxed meals to their employees’ doorsteps. Restaurants in Michigan catered more than 250,000 special meals for Thanksgiving in 2020, which helped them to recover from some revenue losses due to the pandemic. #5 Organize Holiday Events COVID-19 restrictions might change the landscape of events and parties. But by planning ahead and following your local COVID-related restrictions , holiday events can help boost your sales. For example, you might offer a private dining room for small holiday parties. You could promote using the space for a holiday event by creating holiday packages that include festive menu offerings, venue fees, staffing fees, and decorating fees. You can also incentivize your customers by offering early bird discounts so you can lock down the dates and plan for the event. #6 Give Back to the Community It’s always a good idea to spread the holiday joy with those in your surrounding community who are in need. It’s also what many of your customers want you to do. According to one study , more than 80% of customers prefer to spend their money at socially responsible businesses. There are many ways to give back during the holidays. For example, you could: Make it easy for customers to round up their bills to the nearest dollar to donate to a local charity Designate a drop-off spot for your local food bank in your restaurant Incorporate marketing strategy #4 from this list by following Dunkin’ Donuts’ gift card donation scheme . For every gift card purchase, the company donates $1 to Dunkin’ Joy in Childhood Foundation to help families affected by COVID-19 Final Thoughts As we close out the year, it’s clear that the holidays still won’t be looking like they used to before the start of the pandemic. But that’s not going to stop people entirely from celebrating, gathering, and eating good food! By implementing one or more of the holiday marketing ideas we’ve shared, you can make sure consumers want to dine in or take away from your restaurant this holiday season!

In fact, she once swore it off: “I knew what hard work it was and how much it took to be successful,” she says. Perhaps we’d all feel that way if we grew up in the restaurant business. Tara’s father, an immigrant from England, built a career in Carl’s Jr. corporate and bought his first restaurant when Tara was eleven. She saw first-hand what it took to succeed, and she told her parents she would never own a restaurant. To carve—and ensure—a new path for herself, Tara earned a marketing degree. After she got married, however, Tara and her husband realized they wanted to own their own business, with all the joys and challenges that entails. So they stepped in to help operate her family’s company. Ultimately, they expanded that passion into running multiple franchises for different brands across state lines. Tara and her husband now own and operate Jamba and Pieology franchises in addition to Carl’s Jr. So we chatted with her to find out her advice for how to best run and operate QSR franchises across multiple brands. Figure Out Your Real Numbers First The experience of running your first franchise is of course invaluable to running a second. But because you’re taking on a different brand, the way you calculate profit and loss will also be different—so it’s essential to talk to your peers within that franchise to understand how they figure their numbers. When Tara branched out from Carl’s Jr. to take on a Jamba franchise, she drew on that past experience to do her own assessment of the accounting for each location and identify areas for potential improvement. She also had access to the information the franchisor provides prospective franchisees—but she advises against relying on those numbers to make your business decisions. “Many times, franchisors will try to sell you on how much money you’ll make,” she says. “After running a few brands, you learn not just take what corporate tells you at face value. It’s important to talk to other franchisees to see what your real numbers will likely be—particularly if you can talk to people who have been in business for a while and own other brands.” Tara also points to other costs and benefits that enter her calculations—more personalized ones that no franchise owner can provide for her. “When we added Jamba,” she says, “We evaluated the proximity to where we lived and where we traveled already and the upsides and downsides of taking over established corporate stores. The hardest part of expanding to Utah with a new brand was not living right next to our stores. So it took a lot of travel, trips, and investment in the market to help turn those stores around.” Diversify Your Offerings and Locations Tara first decided to diversify after running a successful franchise for more than two decades—and that meant more than taking on a different brand. “Diversifying both in location and in your type of food, you are always prepared should shifts happen in the industry,” she says. She believes that all businesses, especially restaurants, have a life cycle. Diversifying hedges against the inevitable downturn. When burgers take a dive, she still has juice and pizza that can buoy her portfolio. And if you’re in a business that is older or that is starting to see sales die down, then Tara thinks investing in an additional direction is a particularly good idea. Plus, she recommends going for a reputable brand over a newcomer still going through growing pains. “Finding another established brand that serves a different market and deals with different supply chains is a great way to make sure you are covered regardless of what happens in the business,” Tara says. “For instance, during Covid shutdowns, it was very lucrative to have stores that were capable of takeout and drive-through instead of just sit-down.” Beyond diversifying the brands and offerings under your umbrella, Tara touts the importance of location. This can mean opening your doors in multiple states, like she does—but it also means paying attention to location on a micro level. “I can’t stress this enough: You need the right access, sign visibility, and traffic flow,” she says. “Without those, your store will not perform.” Specialize in Hiring, and Keep Hiring to Find the Right Fits The hard part about diversifying is that you’re in essence running multiple distinct companies. You have to stay up-to-date on product launches, changes to operations, and communication from corporate. Internally, you maintain separate books. It’s hard work keeping track of more than one brand. So Tara invests in an operator for each brand who can truly be a brand champion. “You need someone who is always looking out for that brand,” she says. “Someone who is active within the brand’s franchise group, conferences, communications, and webinars.” These brand operators function on a big-picture level, so finding the right fit is wildly beneficial. Staffing each location is its own challenge, and although QSR positions are stereotypically fast turnover, that doesn’t mean they’re any less essential—and Tara understands that turnover rate as part of the process of finding the right people for these roles, too. “Whenever you build a restaurant or take over an existing one, you will usually go through your entire team a few times before you find the right fit,” she says. “That means constant hiring.” Hiring taxes your resources so heavily, and finding great employees is so rewarding, that Tara has felt the temptation that many multi-brand franchisees feel—that temptation to maximize the overlap in staffing between operations, particularly with management. But, she has learned that specialization works better in the end. Knowledge and skills don’t always transfer between brands like you expect them to. “For our stores within the same area, we thought we could have more crossover with staff,” she admits. “But it's hard enough to staff each location. So burdening the managers or the district managers with trying to help out in the other brands did not work.” What has helped her build and maintain strong teams, though? Treating them well. “Invest in your team, in wages, in training, and in perks,” Tara says. “Without your employees, you will not be successful.” Think Locally, Even with a National Brand Successful franchises, almost by definition, have strong brand recognition either nationally or regionally. But success within a single location hangs on so much more than the name above the door. Tara offers these tips for making an individual location thrive within the framework offered by the corporate brand: Be prepared to do it yourself. “Don’t assume that someone at corporate is taking care of something,” she says. “Brands always think they have it together, but especially in food service businesses, there’s a lot of turnover at the corporate level as well. There are always pieces that go wrong—equipment or menu boards or posters not coming in on time, or sometimes not even being able to get product if you're outside a main market. So if it affects you, just take care of it yourself.” Invest in local marketing. “No matter what corporate’s marketing budget is, it is not geared toward your locations specifically,” Tara says. So take charge of your own local advertising and sponsorship opportunities, which you can tailor to your own community. Customize. Every area of the country is different. Even locations across town can experience different scenarios. So don't assume that something that works in one location will work in another. “Do your due diligence with local research into the market and your competitors,” Tara recommends, “and in general just know what people in an area expect with both products and pricing.” Final Thought: Have Fun and Keep Learning Ultimately, remember what got you into running franchises in the first place—especially the aspects you enjoy the most—and keep alive that drive to learn and improve continuously. “It’s fun to be involved with more than one brand,” Tara says. “You get to see more of the marketscape of the food service industry, and you get to take what you learned with one brand and apply it to another. Many restaurant franchisees own multiple brands, so there is a lot of learning and knowledge to tap into between franchises.” TAGS People management Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

In her free time……(oh wait, when you own restaurants there is no free time.) But she does like to cook, travel, and hang out with her husband, 2 kids, and pug, Monty. I often find myself telling people that I want to place a sign in our restaurants that says, \"I didn't raise them, I just hired them.\" I am met with a chuckle, and a curious smile. Until I explain, No, it's really THAT bad. Our managers are not only having to teach new employees how to make food, prep items or put away orders, but they are having to do an unprecedented amount of training for basic life skills. Most of the people we hire have never mopped a floor, cooked a meal, done dishes or (gasp!) cleaned a toilet. More than one employee has walked out on their first day and peeled away in their dad's Mercedes with the comment of \"I don't clean bathrooms---I have a maid for that.\" On top of that, those that do make it past the first day have little interpersonal skills, having grown up behind a screen and not having to deal with people face-to-face like you do with a boss, co-workers, or customers. The first sign of \"trauma\" (which could be a customer simply returning an item made wrong) and they melt and burn like a marshmallow on a stick over a campfire. Inside they are soft and scared and want to slink out the back door, but outside they act angry and rude, bubbling over to the naive customer who thought the employee truly cared about their job. The next day they quit because \"They felt uncomfortable/scared/people are mean/they got in a car accident/their parents told them they could not work anymore/they just cannot handle the stress along with school.\" Historically low unemployment, along with the advent of work-when-you-want-get-paid-instantly companies such as Doordash, Uber, Lyft and Instacart has left a gaping hole in the number of applicants at restaurants and retail, and a drastic shift mentally in the hourly workforce. Unfortunately, most traditional brick and mortar concepts are not able to deal with the new and increased expectations of an on demand workforce, and serve customers well. Don't get me wrong—we have some GREAT employees. But they are few and far between, and are getting fewer and further between. What this means for operators is a constant revolving door of recruiting and hiring. Unfortunately in the current model, this burden falls mostly on management. Managers who are now having to cover more shifts than ever from employees calling out or no-showing. It's so bad that a whole new term---ghosting---- was invented, and I am certain it started in the food industry because we have been dealing with it for years. While we cannot re-raise our employees or instill loyalty or a work ethic in them, or compete with other companies' flexibility or wages, what we CAN do is try to help our managers have an edge on hiring the best possible people. Finding and keeping those raised with grit and gumption is priceless. Here are four tips for hiring in light of today's workforce and competitive pressures: Respond Quickly. Text, don't email. A friend of mine had texted me that his son was applying for one of our restaurants. Before I could tell the manager the next day, my friend let me know his son was hired. Great, I thought, our manager was responsive. Nope—but someone else was. He applied at a nearby establishment which texted him back within 2 hours, interviewed him the next day, and hired him on the spot. If it takes longer than it takes a friend to text you back, it's too long. Also, if you think anyone under the age of 25 checks email multiple times a day, they don't. Texting is by far the fastest and most direct communication with our younger candidates. Collect Tips and Add them to your advertised recruiting wage. Tipping used to be frowned upon in the QSR/Fast Casual world. Not anymore. Our establishments that don't offer credit card tips (due to POS restrictions) often have customers upset they cannot leave a tip for what they consider a lower paid worker. When I added tips to a coffee shop POS, the employees immediately made $3-$4 more an hour AND got amazingly friendlier as well. The small increase in payroll tax cost to the business pales in comparison to the positive effects of tips. Let's face it, most food establishments can't compete with the wages of In-n-Out or Chick-fil-a, but with tips our customers help bring us closer to that level. When recruiting, use the average wage WITH tips. Just make sure it's substantiated by current employee take home pay within a broad time range and clearly advertised as such. Always be Interviewing. Always be Hiring. We like to tell our managers, you are always one person away from being short and two people away from a crisis, so interview every single week and hire at least 2 more people than you think you need. It will help keep your current employees on their toes as they wonder why you are interviewing when they are not even getting all the hours they want. You then simply explain that people's plans are always changing and you don't want to leave the store short-handed when someone quits. (Oh, and by the way dear employee, if you did not ask for every other weekend and 3 nights a week off, you might get more hours too.) Have a robust referral program. A good old fashioned referral program still works. Because, let's face it, everyone wants to work with their friends. What easier way for your employees to make money than referring their friends. Make sure you have clear posters, constant communication about it, and an easy way to track and pay the referral bonuses. Celebrate it on your internal communications to remind other employees how easy it is. One of the changes we recently made to our hiring systems was to add Workstream into the mix. Workstream is a text-to-apply fully automated recruiting tool which allows our managers to schedule interviews and make potential applicants think someone is responding immediately, even when they are busy helping customers. We had looked into a number of text-to-apply programs and many were either too tedious or too costly to consider for our robust and large franchise group . Workstream seemed like the right fit and their team has been nimble, working alongside our recruiting team to help make sure its platform is optimized for our needs. We completed a rollout to 27 locations a few weeks ago, and today I got a message from one of our managers. It was a photo of someone on the beach with their feet up, relaxing in the sun. The caption read, \"Me, in my office, because Hiring now organizes itself. \"Another manager commented back \" Workstream is a dream.\" I can think something is great all I want, but the operators drive decisions in the restaurant industry. I was pleased to see our team embracing this new technology and finding it helpful. While we know the hiring and recruiting pressures are not going away anytime soon, anything that gives our managers a few extra minutes in their day or gets more applicants to show up for interviews, is worth its weight in gold.

Your KPIs are kicking. All signs point toward growth. As an HR Manager, this means it’s time for you to develop a plan to increase headcount to match your projected growth before your current staff becomes overloaded. Before you do, it’s important for you really understand the workforce you’re working with and how to appeal to them. The Multi-Generational Workforce The workforce today is evolving. In the U.S., our workforce currently consists of five generations , with new ones added regularly. Traditionalists or The Silent Generation (born 1926-1945) Baby Boomers (born 1947-1964) Generation X'ers (born 1965-1980) Millennials (born 1981-2000) Generation Z'ers (born 2001-2020) Millennials currently comprise more than a third of the total workforce , making them the largest generational group represented. They are currently on track to continue to outpace other generations—including Gen X—in terms of workforce participation. Baby boomers are predicted to remain employed longer even as they age, generally due to economic reasons. Gen Z has entered the workforce and, as a group, is growing in terms of representation in the workforce. Their entry into the workforce, however, has been r elatively slower. This is likely due to a growing belief that they must earn a college degree in order to obtain a successful career. Why does this matter? Because understanding the different needs and aspirations of the multi-generational labor pool will help you better find and hire them. Meeting Their Needs Now that you know the demographic of the U.S. labor force, let’s move on to what they need. Millennial pressure on the workplace in recent years has succeeded in shifting the way businesses run. It's tough to tell specifically how the incoming Gen Z'ers will drive workforce demands, but experts agree that it's safe to predict that the following employer trends will remain: Using Smartphones The use of smartphones is commonplace among millennials and Gen Z-ers. In fact, these individuals practically need it to go about their daily lives. Considering these two generations are about to make up the bulk of your workforce, you want to be on their radar. Get in front of them by making your hiring process mobile-friendly. This will help you get quality candidates faster and minimize (or prevent) ghosting during the interview process. With Workstream , communications with your candidates are mostly done through text messaging. Our text-to-apply feature makes it easy for a candidate to apply for the job they want, increasing your chances of finding a quality candidate. Additionally, Workstream provides automated SMS reminders to reduce ghosting and two-way texting so that rescheduling of interviews is a breeze for both candidates and hiring managers. Offering Work-Life Balance Employees have big dreams and responsibilities. They want a company that will support them. If not actively, then by giving them the space and freedom they need to work towards their personal goals. This may include allowing them to work from home or providing flexible schedules and adequate time off to attend to their personal and family demands. Digitizing Work Processes Paper timesheets, checks, handwritten notes, and hard copy documents are quickly becoming archaic. Employees continue to require more mobility, accessibility, and flexibility at work. Allow them to communicate with co-workers and managers via text messaging . Convert the dispatching, completing, and sharing of work assignments to electronic systems if it's possible. Provide frequent and meaningful communication. Engaging with employees through a variety of media helps foster deeper relationships and inspires loyalty. Valuing Time Every employee's time is important. Respect it by automating or outsourcing mundane tasks to make their jobs as efficient as possible. Brainstorm ways to streamline company processes and procedures to eliminate or reduce time and resource wastage. Working Toward a Bigger Purpose Nowadays, employees want to work for companies that can help make a positive impact in the world. Millennials and Gen Z'ers care whether their employers are philanthropic, ethical, environmentally sustainable, and so on. Create or rewrite your mission statement and value systems to align with a bigger purpose. If nothing immediately comes to mind, consider starting or increasing charitable contributions to organizations that are meaningful to your company or your industry. Organize volunteer opportunities or donation collections for employees to participate in. Facilitating Upward Mobility Encourage growth and provide employees with ample opportunities to move their careers forward. If promotions or transfers are not feasible, most will be satisfied with the ability to learn more. Provide a variety of educational exercises or training programs in the system your company uses. Even if these arrangements are informal, your employees will appreciate the chance to learn and develop talents that may help them in the future. Emphasizing Importance The working generations are increasingly creative and open-minded, and they expect their employers to be as well. They want to feel free to express ideas and receive recognition for their accomplishments. Listen to suggestions and remain open to changes or improvements which can lead to increased efficiency. Offer rewards for valuable input and achievements. Paying Adequately At the end of the day, the bottom line is this: compensation is important. Ensure that your company is offering competitive wage and benefits packages. If budgets allow, implement rewards, bonuses, or commission programs for meeting or exceeding goals. The U.S. workforce is in a constant state of change. Finding the right hourly workers for your organization can be a daunting task. With a clear understanding of the available labor pool and what they require from their employers, your company can adapt and evolve along with them.

However, the average turnover rate of these employees is astoundingly high at 130% ! We sat down with several leaders in the restaurant and franchise industry to understand what hiring challenges they have faced over the course of their journeys: \"One of the drawbacks of starting as a mobile food truck is that you have an inconsistent work schedule . Simply put, if you are not open every day it becomes increasingly difficult to retain your employees.\" – Rishi Soneja , Owner of CITI PIE \"To find people who want to grow with the company. The industry is very competitive , and you want to be sure that your staff is happy working with you. My goal is to put my staff in the best possible working conditions. Your team is your most important asset and there is no way to grow without a dedicated team.\" - Pierre Thiam, Co-Founder and Executive Chef at Teranga \"I believe one of the challenges today has to do with recruiters. The whole process of contacting quality candidates and setting up an interview sometimes takes too long, and we end up losing them . I guess I am more old school. I still believe in going to the job location, introducing yourself and trying to meet with the chef or manager, despite that it is becoming more difficult to do nowadays.\" - Chef Jose Santos \"The hiring of hourly workers was rather laborious and often chaotic . While there are so many new candidate/job posting search engines there have been few solutions to manage candidates through the hiring process once they submit a job application. With the hourly jobless rate at an all-time low it has been critical to find ways to speed up the application process and automate candidate engagement flow using current media in order to prevent the loss of a candidate to another potential opportunity.\" – Evelyn Scalora , CEO of Tin Pot Creamery \"There are so many opportunities for those looking to work in the food service industry. Not only has to compete with all the local restaurants but also the tech companies. Many tech companies have internal cafeterias with a set menu and regular hours. Many workers are choosing to work there as the stress is much lower and the benefits are amazing .\" - Jeff Chu , CEO & Co-Founder at Joy Tea According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately 41 million people voluntarily left their jobs in 2019. Based on past trends, this number is expected to grow in 2020 and beyond. With about 60% U.S workforce consisting of hourly workers , we can also expect the turnover rate for hourly workers to rise.

Retaining hourly workers is an incredibly difficult job , yet many operators in this business seem to thrive. We gathered several successful restaurant owners and entrepreneurs and asked them to share insight into their leadership styles. Not only were these business leaders capable of hiring great talent, they were also able to manage their business and put together teams that made retention possible. How did they do it? This was what each of them had to say: \"We are like a family. Informal in appearance but still very mission focused.\" - Pierre Thiam, Co-Founder and Executive Chef at Teranga “ Our superpowers come from holding periodic meetings where everyone shares their thoughts regarding the direction we are taking. I try my best to be a good listener because the best decisions have come from these brainstorming sessions. ” \" I find that teamwork and treating everyone as a pivotal part of the process is key.\" - Oliver Schindler, VP Club Relations at National Golf Course Restaurant Association “ I'm a firm believer that being on a team with similar minded people can be dangerous; I try hard to appreciate that each member of my team has a different skill set and should stick to what they are good at. If I could only stress one thing to my team for the rest of my life, it would be that you only get one chance at a first impression\". ” \"I am an interactive relationship builder.\" – David Thomas , Executive Chef at Hook & Reel Cajun Seafood Restaurant & Bar “ I believe in creating a genuine relational space with my staff to create a comfortable living space for us to create in and be our best selves in. Treat people well and they will treat you well has been a working mantra for my team. ” \"I believe in the people I hire, and those people have mine and my company's best interest at heart.\" - Wendy Abony Polland , Founder at the Art of Pecan “ I want people to enjoy their workplace and feel good about what they are doing. Respect for each other goes a long way. ” \"My leadership style is to lead by example.\" - Lilia Fernandez, Co-Founder at Mom's Fresh Juice + Kitchen “ I've got to set the standard for what I want my business to be. For example, I really like the store to be extremely clean and I've showed every single team member my floor cleaning method and done it with them over and over again. At my age, I'm around the same age or younger than much of our team. A lot of people don't take you seriously, so I make it a point to respect everyone and just lead by my example showing them that I also do these kinds of jobs and I'm not here just to boss them around. ” TAGS Recruiting strategies Nigel Seah Nigel is not just a marketer at Workstream, he is also a graduate of Psychology and Marketing of Singapore Management University.

It was there where he decided to be a chef, at 14 years of age. He fell in love with the kitchen by way of community service, as a means to stay out of trouble as a teen. He met his mentor, Joseph Hopkins, at a soup kitchen, and continued to work for him in the years to follow. He takes inspirations from his Mother, Grandmother, Chef Joseph, and circuses that he traveled with along the way. In his youth, David spent summers traveling the country with his aunt, who was a circus performer. Southern Fusion is his favorite cuisine, and his favorite thing to cook is a Collard Green Soup, which has been passed down through his family for generations. While at Morehouse, David Majored in Sociology and was a Member of the \"House of Funk\" Marching Band and Jazz Band, SGA, and Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity. David founded Kinfolk + Cousins in 2017. It is a boutique catering and live events company based in NYC. Their food is inspired by seasons and sourced from trusted local farmers and purveyors. Alongside his Co-Head Chef, Fabian Ferrera, David and his team of experienced and knowledgeable staff offer a wide range of services. From photo shoots to full service catering, Hospitality Consulting, and even Menu Development. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? David: The largest and most consistent challenge I have had in my career is being underestimated from a skills perspective, and being treated differently because of the color of my skin. Q: How you would describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? David: The culture of Kinfolk + Cousins is Love Meals: Real Food for Real People. We believe that food is the great common denominator in life, and the headwaters from which all culture flows. Our super power is our ability to create thoughtful and genuine food and culture spaces. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? David: I am an interactive relationship-builder. I believe in creating genuine relational space with my staff, to create a comfortable living space for us to work, innovate and be our best selves in. Treat people well and they will treat you well – this is the working mantra for my team. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Automate your hiring processes, so that you can spend more time in building relationships with your teammates. A more efficient hiring process allows you to spend less time on scheduling interviews and wasting time on candidates who may have ghosted the interview. This time can then be more effectively spent on understanding your colleagues and creating genuine relationships. With Workstream’s streamlined feed , track all applicants within the same dashboard, and determine candidates that can automatically move on to the next stage. Review and recommend candidates to your fellow hiring colleagues, to allow the interview process to flow seamlessly across the different stages. Prevent ghosting by setting up integrated calendars, that allow candidates to schedule a slot based on their availability, which will save you time in back and forth calls and emails. The best part? Candidates get SMS reminders before interviews, so that they’re able to reschedule should something crop up at the last minute. No more ghosting! Q: Who inspires you and why? David: Walter Massey, my college president. He inspired me as a leader because he was a walking example of the line \"Speak the Kings’ Language, but Walks with the Common Touch\" by Rudyard Kipling. He always made time to speak with students when on campus and we regularly had lunch with him. His wisdom and sage advice continues to me in my life. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? David: Finding the right people is always the greatest challenge. The trend I see in hiring today is companies taking their time, by extending the interview process to spend more time with potential candidates. This allows them to get to know them as people before making a hiring decision. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Find the right people by casting a wider net! Explore the use of text-to-apply posters to make it convenient for candidates to apply, or utilizing job board integrations that optimize job postings. This will allow you to save time and effort, as you can post to over 25,000 job boards with a single click, and view all applicants within the same dashboard. Furthermore, through data-driven analytics , discover opportunities to reduce spend and see which platforms provide long-term hires, and prioritize these platforms to maximize your chances of getting the right candidates. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience David: I started as a dishwasher and prep cook. I worked hard, and now know the value of hard work. I learned so much from what I did there, which still plays a part in guiding me through what I do everyday. Working hard cooperating with a team of people that trust one another will allow you to achieve anything. Racking your brains for solutions to optimize the hiring processes in your QSR?

He then returned to the west coast and settled in San Francisco, at least for now. Since landing in San Francisco, he has worked in almost exclusively food-related careers, from food tech to food retail, and now food production. Outside of being Roli Roti's Brand Director, he is also a freelance food photographer, videographer, and writer. His work has appeared in Food & Wine, Eater SF, and Tastemade, among others. Patrick , is also an avid CrossFit athlete, distance runner, and cook. Q: What professional accomplishments are you most proud of since you started the Roli Roti project? Patrick: Roli Roti was already an impressive company before I joined the team, but I'd like to think that I helped breathe life back into its digital presence. Having been around for almost two decades now, I was Roli Roti's very first full-time marketing hire. Before I joined, they didn’t have any consistent social media presence, or any sort of digital presence. In the year that I've been here, their social media following has grown by 50; brand collaborations have brought Roli Roti more local relevance; and with additional marketing and design help, Roli Roti's retail products (Butcher's Bone Broth and Butcher's Salad Chicken) went from being in just 500 stores to over 3000. I wouldn't say any of these accomplishments are attributed to just me, but I think I helped grease the wheels to get these things in motion, with a great and ambitious team! Q: What are the superpowers of your team? Patrick: Despite having been around for about 17 years now, our team still feels like one of a start-up. With that, our superpowers are being scrappy, indefatigable, and creative. While we have our own separate roles, we all work incredibly hard, are super collaborative to be solution-oriented, and strive to always find ways to solve issues that are bound to be encountered by a company of our size. We may not have the most resources or capital, but we do have a fighting spirit that keeps us agile, innovative, and tireless. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: To build a power team, you’ll first need the right resources. Get better applicants and find quality candidates through text-to-apply posters. What better way to make things convenient for potential applicants than by making everything mobile and at their fingertips? Print out a custom poster to display, and interested individuals can simply scan the QR code or text the number displayed. They will then instantly gain access to all open positions. Job board integrations also ensure that you get to post to 25,000 job boards in one click, and view all applicants in the same dashboard. Reach a greater pool of candidates, all while optimizing your job postings to get in front of 10 times as many job seekers. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Patrick: I would say the underlying principle with how I lead is kindness. I am a firm believer in treating everyone well, no matter their role. I think that if you treat people fairly and kindly, you develop a rapport that allows your teammates to work with you more seamlessly and with more grit. I don't think driving your team into the ground is sustainable, nor a good way to get the best out of your teammates. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Patrick: Working with leaders who did not know how to lead. I think especially in the Bay Area, there are so many talented and ambitious people who have brilliant ideas who found amazing companies. However, I don't think talent and ambition always translates into being a good leader or manager. At the end of the day, a good leader requires empathy and confidence that makes their team want to work harder and believe in a common goal. Throughout my career, I feel that I've worked with some leaders whose leadership style I thought was detrimental to the company. This is despite wanting, personally and professionally, to see the company succeed. The tug-of-war between wanting to do your job well but conflicting with the compass that your leader has given you has definitely been the toughest struggle. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Find yourself not being able to spend more time with your co-workers due to always being tied up with interviews and hiring processes? Automate the process through smart screening, which allows you to set multiple choice questions and automate scoring. Only qualified applicants will move forward to the interview, saving you from doing manual screening. Integrated calendars are also a life-saver, as you can determine vacant slots where you’re available for an interview. Qualified candidates will receive a link to your calendar, and pick a time based on mutual availability. Completely eliminate time spent on back-and-forth calls and emails! This also effectively reduces ghosting, as candidates are sent automatic reminders prior to their interviews, and provided with an option to reschedule should they need to. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Patrick: Particularly in the food world and in an expensive landscape such as the Bay Area, small companies like ours want to find talent that want to stick around. People who want to align themselves with your company's values and missions, and that is really tough. Small companies can't compete with the compensation of giants like Google and Facebook. As a result, great candidates will often likely flock to these larger companies to help accommodate living in a place like the Bay Area. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Consider asking candidates to submit a quick introduction video – it is a convenient way to determine who is genuinely interested in the position and are willing to stick around. Furthermore, their personality shines through, and you’ll get to watch interesting video resumes instead of sifting through seemingly similar physical resumes. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Patrick: When I was in college, I was an aspiring news reporter. I took a job as an hourly intern at a news station in Manhattan. It was grueling. I worked the graveyard shift on Fridays and the weekends. It was tiring and thankless, and honestly one of the worst experiences I've ever had professionally. It made me realize, though, that the world of TV news maybe wasn't for me, and also that I could operate on very little sleep. Looking to grow your company?

Share this article Engaging hourly workers is harder than engaging salaried ones mainly because the nature of their employment makes it more difficult to create strong relationships with them. They constantly work rotating shifts and, most often than not, work at more than one location. As such, their managers and other HR professionals are not always able to communicate with them regularly. However, motivating and engaging them increases their job satisfaction. And when they're more satisfied with their job, they will naturally become more productive and motivated to go above and beyond their assigned tasks to truly contribute to your company. This is precisely the reason why you should put in some effort to boost their engagement. All of these can lead to higher retention and increase your company’s ROI. So, what should you do to achieve these ideals? How can you effectively reduce your turnover rate and create a strong team of engaged hourly workers? Here are some of the more important steps you can start with. Increase Employee Recognition A lot of hourly workers are not satisfied with their job because they don't feel supported and recognized in their workplaces. According to the Randstad Employee Brand Research (REBR) 2018 , 27% of employees say that a lack of recognition is what drives them away from an employer. Fortunately, many HR leaders are increasingly realizing that - which is why many of them are introducing employee recognition programs into their organizations. According to the 2018 SHRM/Globoforce Employee Recognition Report , 84% of HR leaders say that their employee recognition program helps with employee engagement, while 89% of HR executives feel that their program improves the employee experience. If you don't have your own employee recognition program, consider at least training your managers to support your hourly workers by treating them fairly and providing them with constructive and actionable feedback. Try to encourage your managers to empathize with their employees and do their best to make them feel valued by always acknowledging their effort. Such respect and recognition can go a long way as it’ll lead to much better job satisfaction and engagement. Improve Your Scheduling Process One of the most important factors for engaging hourly workers is their work schedule. Hourly workers need flexibility , but they often don't get it. Your employees would want to know when exactly they are going to work in advance. That is, all the days and times they will need to show up for work. This, however, is not a common practice among a great number of employers and a lot of them tend to phone their hourly workers outside work hours at the last minute to ask them to switch their shifts and promptly come to work. Needless to say, this is not at all engaging. Instead, it can get very infuriating and drive away even the most loyal employees. Your hourly workers have their lives and responsibilities outside the job, so don't strip them of their free time. Instead of compromising their work-life balance, help them maintain it and let them know about their upcoming shifts in advance. Offer Opportunities for Professional Development Professional development is another factor that a huge number of employees are looking for when searching for a job. They want their job to be a stepping stone in their career. In other words, they don't want to stay at square one for years, not growing professionally nor moving towards other meaningful job opportunities. According to a new study conducted by Bridge , 86% of millennials say that offering career training and development would keep them from leaving their current job position. Thus, don't let your hourly workers see their job as a temporary solution before they move to where they actually want to be. Show them that there are plenty of future growth opportunities at your company and help them build strong careers. Provide training courses and career mentorships, and help them learn and grow professionally every step of the way. Introduce Healthy Competition While there are hourly workers who simply want to eventually switch to a place where they would start receiving a fixed salary, there are always those who may not think about leaving their current job to build a career. So, besides offering career development opportunities and improving employee recognition and scheduling, you can introduce some friendly competition into your workplace. According to research conducted by Anthony Nyberg , a research director at the Center for Executive Succession, pay-for-performance bonuses can greatly boost employee engagement and performance, and even generate a 213% ROI. Therefore, motivate your hourly workers with regular bonuses based on their performance instead of giving them an annual raise, for instance. Bonuses will encourage them to work harder and make them feel happier about their job, which leads to higher engagement and retention. Make Your Workplace More Enjoyable It's common to see many hourly workers prefer a job that doesn't pay well but makes them feel satisfied with a job that pays very well but doesn't exactly fulfill them. As such, try making your workplace a fun and enjoyable environment that every employee will love. Provide them with a well-equipped break room with snacks and some entertainment options, where they can have fun and recharge their batteries. Brighten the workplace, continually provide exciting team-building activities, and introduce anything else that will bring all the workers and managers closer together so that they genuinely look forward to coming to work. All of this will significantly increase engagement, motivation, and retention, and it will bridge gaps in communication, helping all employees create meaningful relationships with one another. They will eventually become a strong team that will work closely together towards achieving your organization's goals and objectives. As you can certainly see, engaging hourly workers doesn't seem so impossible now, does it? It can be a daunting task, but all the effort does pay off in the long run. Consider following all of these steps, but don't stop there. Be sure to explore other ideas as well as there's always room for improvement.

Job openings have risen to a two-year high, with at least 104,000 openings in the accommodation and food services sector. However, QSRs are facing a challenge as they are unable to hire sufficient workers to meet the rising demands - despite the rise in job opportunities, the number of candidates remains low. Attractive stimulus checks and unemployment benefits, coupled with the fear of being infected with Covid-19, are keeping potential applicants at home instead of looking for work. To make matters worse, QSRs are not competing for new hires not only within the industry but with many others as hiring is picking up. Apart from looking at how your QSR can hire creatively , there is also value in understanding what QSR employees value, so as to retain your current hires, while simultaneously reaching out to potential candidates more effectively with attractive offers. Here are some insights as to what QSR employees are currently looking out for, to determine if they should stay at their current job. A Safe Environment With the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, safety has become a priority and workers are not willing to put their lives at risk, especially when they have to interact with many customers or co-workers at close proximity for a large part of the day. Reassure current employees (and potential candidates) by enforcing donning of masks, safe distancing measures, enhanced cleaning, and even providing personal protective equipment for staff if necessary. These standards should not be limited to the employees of your QSR, but also to customers , who should follow appropriate safety precautions or should otherwise not be allowed into the restaurant. Ensure that these safety measures are strictly enforced, to give employees peace of mind as they work, knowing that the precautions have been taken to create a safer working environment. Training and Recognition in the Workplace Workplace training is crucial in boosting job satisfaction, career progression, and retention. However, studies conducted by YOOBIC have shown that 40% of the frontline workers surveyed are only trained once a year or less, which results in them feeling undervalued and insufficiently trained. 58% also believe that the most important thing about training is that it is fun and engaging. Successful training helps improve the morale of workers, provides them with more information, and is ultimately a win-win scenario for both employees and your QSR. Consider incorporating mobile training , since most people are accessing information through their mobile devices. By making it convenient for them to access information, your employees are also likely to engage with training content more actively. Send handbooks, checklists, and training videos via a text message link, which can be sent to new hires and existing employees. These could include new guides on safer Covid-19 measures, and how they can do their part to help create a safer work environment. SMS reminders can also be sent, to guarantee completion, and hiring managers can easily review completion rates. This point is also in line with another finding from YOOBIC's survey, where 70% of frontline workers think app-based training would be easier. 76% of employees would also feel more connected if they could access company communications on a mobile device. Therefore, mobile training would not only familiarize your employees with onboarding and training processes but will also empower them. Digitazation and Adaptation As Millennials and Gen Zs enter the workforce, they come with a different set of learning styles and experiences. However, YOOBIC's survey has also shown that millennial frontline workers are the most dissatisfied. This is due to a misalignment between their expectations and what organizations have been doing - one particular example stated that training wasn't adapted to Tomlinson's largely Gen Z and Millennial workforce, since it was done in-person with paper or pdf materials. Consider adaptations such as paperless onboarding , which not only saves time in onboarding and paperwork but also meets in the middle with expectations of Millennials and Gen Zs. All paperwork will also be easily retrievable and can be conveniently stored with electronic signatures, saving employees time from heading down to the physical store just to submit their signed contracts. Additionally, automated scheduling will also convenience interview candidates, as they get a text message link to your Google calendar to schedule a zoom, based on pre-set availability. This saves time on back and forth communication, and reminders sent also reduce ghosting, making the entire interview process efficient and seamless. By adopting greater digitalization in your processes, recruiting can be made much simpler and seamless, while saving time and providing greater convenience to employees. Higher Wages and Tips Based on a report by One Fair Wage , 76% of those surveyed are planning to leave their jobs due to low wages and tips. Restaurants reopening at reduced capacity would result in lower tips, and fewer workers are willing to put their health at risk, and would rather live on unemployment benefits. This is why many restaurants, such as Chipotle, are now offering competitive wages and attractive benefits, including education and bonuses. Monitor the wages and benefits paid out by competitors, especially in comparison to the minimum wage, to determine if your current salaries are attractive to potential candidates. The wages and additional benefits will also have to be perceived to outweigh unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, for these candidates to be willing to apply for the job. A Simplified and Streamlined Application Process Successfully attracting the interest of a potential candidate is half the battle won, but whether they fully complete the application form is highly dependent on the application process. If candidates had to choose between a 5-minute form to a 30-40 minute one, their final choice would be obvious. By having a simple, streamlined application form, candidates are more likely to go through with submitting the form. Make it easy for potential applicants by stripping your application form to the bare essentials. Avoid asking duplicate questions, or asking for excessive information that may not be necessary, and leave them to the interview stage. Alternatively, consider ways to make the process more interactive. This could be in the form of gamification, personality tests, or even video resumes . By making the process different, and even fun, applicants are more likely to stay on and finally complete the application form. Utilizing automated scoring systems in application forms can also help shorten turnarounds, allowing candidates to find out if they've made it to the next round as soon as possible. This reduces instances where candidates accept another job offer even before you've informed them that they qualify for the next round, or have been offered a job at your QSR. To Wrap Up By understanding the perspectives of what employees and potential applicants want from a QSR job, you will be able to cater to their needs and retain them, while simultaneously attracting new candidates. Take time to build interpersonal communication with your employees and determine what matters to them, and provide support whenever possible. A little effort goes a long way, and who knows, these past and current employees may also be the key to more applicants through referrals and positive word of mouth.
