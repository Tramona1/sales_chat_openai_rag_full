    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter 08/25/22 What is employee turnover? Share this article All businesses experience employee turnover. After all, nobody works forever. However, the percentage of employee turnover is important for a business's overall success. Businesses with high turnover are chronically short-staffed. The remaining employees experience worse working conditions, and it’s harder to attract new talent, creating a cycle that can spell disaster for the company. A reasonable rate of turnover varies dramatically depending on the organization and industry, so it’s important to understand what kind of turnover your business should be aiming for. Here's what you need to know about what employee turnover is and how to calculate it, as well as how to understand whether your employee turnover is too high and what to do about it. What is Employee Turnover? Employee turnover, or staffing turnover, measures how many employees leave in a particular time period. It refers to all employees who have left the business, including people who were fired or laid off or who left for other reasons, such as transferring, retiring, or changing to a different career. How is employee turnover calculated ? To calculate employee turnover, divide the number of people who left the company in a time period by your average number of employees in that time period. Then, multiply by 100. Here’s an example. Say you started the month with 30 employees. Five left and you replaced four of them. Your monthly total employees is 29. Divide 5 by 29, and you get .17. Multiply by 100, and you find that your monthly employee turnover is 17%. Only include employees who have permanently left to the best of your knowledge. Temporary employees or employees on leave should not be counted as staff turnovers. Should You Calculate Voluntary and Involuntary Staff Turnovers Separately? All organizations experience both voluntary and involuntary turnover. Voluntary turnover is any situation in which an employee chooses to leave. Voluntary turnover is when it is the employer's choice to terminate the relationship. Does the reason matter when you're thinking about how many employees have left your company? Possibly. It can be helpful to calculate these kinds of staff turnovers separately. If you find that your company has many more employees that leave by quitting than firing or vice versa, it may be an opportunity to examine how you’re handling employee relations. This is also a chance to more closely examine the circumstances under which people leave your company. This kind of investigation can be hugely beneficial when it comes to reducing employee turnover and improving work experiences at your company. What is a Good Employee Turnover Rate? The expected employee turnover for a business depends on what kind of company it is. Some industries, such as hotels or restaurants, have higher turnover than others, like government jobs or white-collar industries. For instance, the monthly employee turnover rate in fast food restaurants was 144% this year. So, if a fast food restaurant typically staffs about 30 people, 43 people left the team in just one month. If you're in the fast food industry and comparing yourself to most other industries, you probably think your turnover is terrible at a rate of over 100%, but it’s actually very reasonable for your business. Acceptable turnover for your company depends entirely on what line of work you're in. A variety of factors specific to your business can also affect turnover. For instance, if you’re doing business somewhere with a high seasonal population, such as a college town, you'll likely see higher turnover than similar companies in places with more stable populations. The best way to understand whether your employee turnover is acceptable is to compare your turnover to that of businesses as similar to yours as possible. Is 20% Employee Turnover High? For the vast majority of industries, a turnover of 20% is reasonable, but on the higher side of what’s acceptable.The majority of organizations fall at a turnover rate of between 12% and 20%. Of course, as discussed above, many industries have much higher turnover rates. Whether the rate is too high for your business depends on the employee turnover costs . For companies that invest little into training and recruiting their workers, losing an employee isn't a significant loss. However, for companies that aggressively search out the best talent and put a lot of energy into training them, a high turnover rate can be devastating for the company's bottom line. In general, businesses that employ highly technical and experienced workers would see 20% turnover as the highest they would be willing to tolerate, whereas businesses employing employees with less experience and training are typically okay with higher turnover rates, even rates over 100%. What Causes Employee Turnover? Employee turnover is a perfectly natural part of any business. However, understanding the reasons employees leave is valuable. Knowing about your company's employee turnover can enable you to anticipate and reduce employee turnover . Here are a few of the primary reasons employees leave a company. Retirement Retirement is one of the most predictable causes of turnover, but there can still be unexpected spikes. In the third quarter of 2020, a whopping 28.6 million baby boomers retired, 3.2 million more than in the same quarter of the previous year. Global events like a pandemic or economic events like recessions can cause employees who may be close to retirement age to retire early or keep working longer. Anticipating these swings in retirement can help companies plan for them. Employee Shortages When everybody is scrambling for employees, the workers have the upper hand. This is a strong driver of employee turnover up and down the economic ladder, from low-wage employees seeking out the restaurant that pays the most to highly skilled technical professionals being head-hunted by competing firms. It's not just money that employees are after either. Employees are leaving for better hours, more extensive benefits, and work-from-home opportunities. If you know what your employees are likely to leave for, you’re more likely to find ways to keep them. Lack of Opportunity If there's nowhere within a company for an employee to grow into, they'll grow out of the company. There's certainly some degree to which all companies will experience this kind of progress, but whenever possible, it's beneficial to give employees space to move up in the company instead of losing them. Providing training or financial assistance for education that allows employees to fill new roles is a powerful way to keep the talent you've invested in. Unhappy at Work Not every employee is a good fit for every job. Some employees find their role unsatisfactory, regardless of how good the company is at acclimating and training them. Some employees become tired of their job even though little has changed. However, factors like a toxic work environment, poor management, and chronic overwork can make even loyal employees think about leaving. Learn how your employees feel about their work and where they think there could be improvements before their dissatisfactions drive them to work somewhere else. Poor Work-Life Balance Some employees are perfectly happy at work, but their work is making it impossible for them to be happy elsewhere. Erratic schedules, long hours, physically or mentally taxing work, or excessive stress can make it difficult for employees to thrive in their home life. Over time, they may be driven away from a job they enjoy as a result. This often occurs as younger employees grow within the company, get families and personal lives, and find that they can no longer keep up with the pace of their work. Understanding the stress a job puts on an employee can enable you to spread work more evenly or hire more employees for a role when necessary. Feeling Unappreciated Employees don't just want a schedule and a paycheck. They want to feel that what they do every day matters and that their efforts have value beyond the money it brings in. Even if an employee is relatively happy at work, successfully balancing their work and personal life, and isn't looking for more advanced opportunities, simply feeling that management is indifferent to their efforts can be enough to cause some people to look for another position. This becomes more likely the longer somebody is with a company. As the employee begins feeling a greater sense of loyalty to the business they want to feel that the business cares about and appreciates them. What is the Cost of High Employee Turnover? Regardless of what kind of business you run, you want employee turnover to be as low as possible. It's true that some businesses are chronically plagued by high employee turnover . However, it reflects very well on your likelihood of success if your company has lower turnover rates than your competition. Here are some of the consequences of a high turnover rate. Employees Want to Work at Businesses With Low Turnover Potential employees take turnover rates into account when choosing whether to work at your business or not. If your company has a reputation for employees that leave soon after being hired, whether they quit or are fired, you'll likely find it more difficult to attract new talent. On the other hand, if your company is known for satisfied employees, you probably won't have difficulty filling the vacancies you do have. Replacing Employees can be Expensive The more you've invested into an employee, the more you lose when they quit. Even in industries with typically high turnover, it's easy to see the cost of hiring and replacing an employee. There are uniforms to be bought and distributed, shadowing time with another employee to learn what needs to be done, and early mistakes as the new trainee gets the hang of things. The more often this has to happen, the more expensive it gets. High Turnover is a Hit To Morale Most companies rely on their current employees to train new employees. However, this relationship doesn't just extend to the basics of how to get the job done. Company culture is also passed along from long-term employees to new employees. Workers who have been with the company for a long time are a powerful force for maintaining and disseminating company values. If your business fails to keep long-term employees, you'll lose this powerful stabilizer of culture. Remaining Employees Suffer When You're Short-Staffed High turnover often goes hand and hand with chronic understaffing. While you're struggling to replace the person who has left, remaining employees take on the burden of extra work. The remaining employees (who may also have some of the complaints that the person who left had), are now laden with additional work and the responsibility of training a new hire to replace the person who has left. Companies that chronically put their employees in this situation are likely to see even more employees leave. How to Reduce Employee Turnover What is employee retention ? Reducing employee turnover by even a few points can make a difference in how smoothly your business operates. While some types of businesses will always experience higher turnover than others, there are things you can do to bring down your company's turnover rate, regardless of what industry you're in. Write a Good Job Description The first step to reducing the number of employees that leave your business is making it more likely that they wanted to be there in the first place. Job descriptions that are overly rosy, vague, or don't accurately describe the job that needs to be done attract employees who quit soon after they realize what the job really is. If you notice that a lot of your turnover comes from employees quitting soon after starting, a poor job description may be the culprit. Pay Attention to Recruitment Be discerning about the people you choose to hire and train. Companies that hire unskilled workers often don't put a lot of effort into screening and end up wasting a lot of energy training people who are not likely to thrive in the role they've been hired for. If a significant amount of employee turnover comes from employees who quit during or soon after training, it may be that you aren't recruiting people who are likely to do well in the position you need to fill. Be Deliberate About Onboarding The majority of training and onboarding at most companies is done by current employees, typically with a shadowing or mentoring program. There's nothing wrong with this kind of system for onboarding, but management needs to be conscious of ensuring it is done correctly. Employees who are frustrated by the extra work it takes to train somebody or looking for an opportunity to take it easy for a shift may skirt some of the responsibilities of onboarding. Even small oversights at the beginning can lead to mistakes in understanding that cause major issues and bad feelings down the road. Make sure that only responsible employees are put in charge of training and properly motivate them to train the new employees well. Communicate With Your Employees Effective communication that keeps employees happy and wanting to work at your company goes both ways. It is, of course, important for you to give employees feedback so that they do their jobs well. However, it’s just as important for you to elicit feedback from your employees. Learn what they like about their jobs and where they're struggling. Are they having a hard time maintaining a good work-life balance? Do they feel that management is responding appropriately to their needs and concerns? Do they work well with their teammates? Learn how your employees feel about their everyday work experience, and you'll be much more likely to catch problems before they turn into something worth quitting over. This is also a good opportunity to learn when an employee may be looking for places to branch out so you can give them a path for advancement within your company instead of having them leave for another opportunity. Actively Build Loyalty Loyalty is too often overlooked because it is a soft resource that can be difficult to pin down. However, employees who feel loyal to you and your company are more likely to stick it out and stay with you, even if there may be another good opportunity on the horizon or your company is going through a difficult patch. Recognize your employees' achievements, foster bonding activities by hosting parties or playing games, and build a company culture of mutual respect. Take the time to learn about your employees' lives, what they're passionate about, and what brings them joy. Even something as simple as tasking an employee who loves to garden with choosing and caring for office plants or allowing a sports fan to decorate and host an office party centered around a sports event can be all it takes to develop powerful loyalty in the employee you single out and the employees around them as well. Give Employees Reasons to Stay Raises that correspond with time spent at a company and new skills that employees gain while they're with your business keep your current employees with you and inspire new employees to stay longer and do more. While raises and benefits are often controlled by your budget and the position, it’s worth finding wiggle room to reward superior performance. Some perks, like more flexibility in the schedule or the opportunity to manage office tasks that requires a good deal of responsibility, can come free but mean a lot to the employee. Even a heartfelt conversation with an employee about how much you value them but why you can’t offer a bigger raise right now can convince an employee to feel positively about working for you. Keep More of Your Employees for Longer Regardless of what business you're in, it is beneficial for you to reduce employee turnover. There's nothing you can do to completely eliminate turnover at your company, but by recruiting carefully, communicating well, actively building loyalty, and giving employees plenty of reasons to stay, you'll likely find that you can significantly reduce your company's turnover. You'll find that you spend less time and money hiring and training and that business runs more smoothly when you commit to reducing employee turnover.

But, it may be the right one. You need team members you can rely on. Team members who work well with the team and serve your customers well. When that alignment doesn’t exist, you may need to protect your team, your customers, and your business by making a very hard and emotional decision to part ways. If you’re wondering whether or not it’s time to part ways with an employee, here are the considerations to keep in mind. Spotting red flags If your employee exhibits one or more of the following traits, it may be a sign that it's time to part ways. Absenteeism Does your employee often come to work late or not show up at all? Perhaps they have an explanation every time. While the first few times may be excusable, continued tardiness negatively impacts the team and the individual’s performance. This is behavior that shouldn’t be condoned. Poor attitude Some employees may express disinterest in learning or following processes. Maybe they shrug it off with, \"I'm just not good with change.\" This attitude is detrimental to your business. Your team is only as strong as its weakest link, and that employee will eventually drag it down—either by creating more work for the team or by setting the wrong tone. Excuses An employee who is constantly blaming their poor results on the company systems or their colleagues instead of proactively finding solutions to solve the problem is potentially throwing up a red flag. This is especially so if they are the only employee with such an issue, while their teammates are consistently able to meet or exceed performance expectations. Argumentative When an employee constantly picks fights with you or their fellow teammates or is uncooperative, it could result in low morale for the entire team. It may not be worth running the risk of having more unhappy employees. Constant disagreement with co-workers can lead to higher turnover . Badmouthing Is your employee often found badmouthing supervisors or being the ringleader of office gossip? When the employee is sowing discord and blatantly showing dislike toward the company's initiatives and project requirements, they may influence and encourage those around them to do the same. Poor productivity and morale Is your employee constantly producing low-quality output, excessively asking other teammates for help, or causing workflow delays? Not only does this affect how the team works together, but it also impacts the customer experience. Complaints from customers and vendors Experiencing a high volume of complaints that trace back to a single employee? You ultimately answer to your customers and vendors, so if you're experiencing poor work quality, you need to begin asking yourself how to part ways with an employee. Word of mouth from a bad experience could be detrimental to your business Violation of Company Policies The most prominent red flag is when an employee violates company policies. When they're constantly breaking rules, or worse, committing criminal violations, it’s a sure sign that it's time to let them go. Terminating an Employee Once you’ve identified the signs and have decided that the best path forward is termination, here are a few things you should do. Start with Performance Reviews First, be clear about the reasons behind the termination. Prior to reaching this point, you should have been having regular performance reviews to correct attitudes and behaviors and give the employee a chance to improve. These performance reviews are a great way to document progress (or lack thereof). Take Legal Considerations Before the termination, go through the employee’s contract to determine if there are any legal implications to consider. Do you have to give them a month's notice? Can it be an immediate termination? Ensure that you're parting ways on legal grounds, not as an act of discrimination, for example. To play it extra safe, you may want to consult an attorney. Create a Transition Plan A transition plan consists of two parts: ensuring that the workload is covered and determining when to break the news. The first step is critical. You’ll want to make sure you have a plan in place to cover the workload so your current team doesn’t feel overwhelmed. When it comes to breaking the news, find a time and a place that will create the least amount of disruptions to your customers and employees. Plan What You’ll Say When the employee fails to show effort and/or improvement, it's time to part ways. Give a lot of thought to the words you’ll use to break the news. Words can be taken out of context, so be very clear and empathetic in your communications. Plan ahead for any questions (ie. When can I expect my last paycheck? When does my insurance stop?) the employee might ask so you can respond with well-thought answers and set them up for an easy transition). Have a Witness It’s best to invite someone from HR to be present. If you have a small company, a trusted manager or employee works too. Having a witness is especially important because they will be able to vouch and validate the conversation. In circumstances where the employee has a history of violent or aggressive tendencies, you may even consider hiring a police escort to keep all parties safe. Don't Humiliate the Employee Each employee should still be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of the circumstance. This means having a conversation with them behind closed doors, without sounding condescending or demeaning throughout the process. By keeping things calm and respectful, you will also avoid affecting the morale of other employees. Break the News Start by explaining the reasons behind the termination, but avoid justifying these with phrases like, \"You should have known.\" Be direct, and get to the point by referring to employment in the past tense, such as \"has been terminated\" rather than \"will be terminated.\" You don't want to give them false hope, or openings to negotiate otherwise. Avoid words like \"I understand how you feel\" to soften the blow; it may only make matters worse. Instead, listen to what they have to say. You can end by saying, “I’m sorry we have to part our ways.” Ensure that all grounds are covered, such as references, current projects, and their benefits. Tell Your Employees Address the news with your employees early, but only after the employee has been formally let go. Give them an update on the changes, particularly as it relates to workload and the possible role opening, to avoid gossip and speculation. Being honest (without oversharing details) and forthcoming with employees about the changes will help you maintain trust. It is best to be transparent about the reasons you had to part ways with the employee. Keeping Your Team Strong When an employee creates a difficult work environment, the best thing you can do for your team—and for the team member—is to part ways. It’s much better for everyone to backfill one role than to replace an entire team. Your employees will recognize that you had their best interest in mind and your customers will appreciate the quality standard you maintain.

As we celebrate this meaningful holiday, let us not forget the efforts of the hourly workers who spend long hours at work to make sure you have everything you need to celebrate this special day. From stocking up the grocery stores with cooking ingredients, to preparing those pumpkin pies in bakeries for your dinner, these hourly workers have done a lot to contribute to your ideal Thanksgiving dinner. We definitely think that they deserve some love and thanks from all of us too! And who better to ask for tips on showing appreciation to them than a former manager of hourly workers himself. We spoke to our very own Business Development Associate and former Owner of Utah Maids, Jaron Hall . Q: What role did you play the company you founded? I was the Owner of Utah Maids , a residential cleaning service. I started Utah Maids because I saw an opportunity in my area (Salt Lake City) to create a home cleaning service with a modern approach to customer management and booking - using modern tools to run an existing service. Q: What was you job scope? I would assist with the management of hourly employees, meet with customers, improve the quality of service, and more. I also brought on many programs to help with managing employees - online training, attendance tracking sheets, scheduling software, automated emails and texts, and so much more. Q: In terms of people management, what challenges did you face and how did you deal with them? Because our staff are the face of our company, I am constantly trying to recruit reliable and responsible staff who are eager to learn. Our service quality depends on the skill level of our staff. The key to having high quality staff is to make things as simple as possible and align incentives for them to follow procedures. Scheduling is probably one of the more challenging tasks. Keeping employees happy with their schedule, dealing with no-call and no-show rates, and being understaffed or overstaffed. These are all things that happened, and they need to be addressed. It’s important to set up a structured process of managing the problems so you don’t constantly run into the same issues. When such HR issues came up, I had a manager who would first hear about them and handle them if she was able to. If it was an elevated issue it would come to me. There are many things that are repeatedly experienced, but I would also come across new cases and have to assess them. Q: Based on these experiences, what have you learnt about people management? I would always try to be personable with my staff. I think it is important relate to them on a personal level and show them how you can relate to them in many ways. Be a friend to them, communicate with them often and show them that you are not above them, but that you can work alongside with them. Provide a structure where harder work will result in higher reward. Make it so their compensation correlates with their results. Q: What are some of the best ways to show gratitude to your team/followers? One of the things I did often was to give my staff surprise gifts. An amazon gift card for when I see some good performance. I also kept the office supplied with snacks and encouraged staff to help themselves when they stopped by. I also gave praises and recognition to employees in front of their co-workers. I think one of the biggest things you can do is to relate to your staff on a human level. Be incredibly empathetic, without getting taken advantage of. When managing hourly staff, there are many cases where personal circumstances come up. Show your staff that you’re understanding about their personal life. Be the boss that you would want to have.

Whether these gigs are full-time or part-time , jobs on Craigslist can really benefit your business needs. As the world’s biggest online classified ad section, Craigslist now has at least 60 million U.S. users, 50 billion page views monthly, as well as 50 million daily queries ( source ). Add a job ad on Craigslist in 6 steps Posting on a job on Craigslist is fairly straightforward - there are  six steps, which we take you through below. The more complicated part is how to make your job posting standout. Here's everything you need to know about employment on Craigslist, how to post jobs on Craigslist, and how it can help you hire the best candidates. We’ll also talk about common mistakes to avoid and that includes scams and scammers . 1. Create Account This is as straightforward as it can get. Creating an account on Craigslist is easy due to Craigslist being a free job posting site . All you need is simply your email address and a password. Remember to verify your email before you start listing your jobs. If you want multiple people to login to add jobs and/or receive email notifications about applicants, consider creating a new shared email address. Alternatively, you can post the job through Workstream so all the applicants populate in the Workstream dashboard. 2. Set your Location After you create an account on Craigslist , you need to set your location. Make sure that the location is where you want your hires to be based. This is a very common mistake - a lot of hiring managers will post their home/office location (for example: San Francisco) even though they are hiring for a store in another location (for example: Sacramento). You might get a lot of views for your job posting , but they won’t convert to actual hires if the location is set incorrectly. 3. Select a Category To start listing a job ad , click on create a posting . Under the type of posting, select job offered and then choose a category for your Craigslist job post . You can post to multiple job categories to get more views, but you pay for each category - usually the cost is around $25; some cities, such as San Francisco, cost $75+ per category. View the public category for your city to determine whether you’re a good fit for that category. Sometimes it pays to post in a category that is indirectly related to the role if that category has fewer postings - you’re more likely to stand out. For example, the food/bev/hospitality category in San Francisco receives around 100 posts every single day; the retail category receives around 15. Most people don’t scroll past the second page of job postings , so you will get more views in this less populated category. 4. Write a Post In the job posting , add a description of the role, enticing details about your brand, employment type, required skills/experience, compensation structure and contact details. 5. Use Address for Map Next, you’ll want to add contact info for applicants to apply. If you have a Workstream account, you can use the “text-to-apply” functionality and ask applicants to text you - this is guaranteed to drive more applicants to your door. Watch this 2-minute video from Cinnabon for reference. If you don’t have Workstream, we recommend using the CL mail relay to avoid getting spammed by recruiters . Make sure to add your business/store address to your contact info and make sure to select “show on maps.” This is hugely important because many hourly workers search for jobs based on proximity to their home. Applicants can zoom into their city to see active job postings in their neighborhoods. If you forget to check the “show on maps” box, you’ll get a fraction of potential visitors to the job posting ! 6. Review & Publish Take a few minutes to review your job posting before accepting the Terms of Use. If everything looks good, click the “publish” button in the bottom right. If this is your first job posting , you’ll be asked to verify the job posting via email before it goes live. Tips & Tricks to Improve Visibility Titles that Standout The title is the most important part of your ad because it's the first thing that job seeker will notice. Use a catchy job title to attract the attention of your potential applicants. Including details like “bonus guaranteed” and “excellent pay” helps to get more applicants. Include emojis and the salary in the title (see examples below). You can copy and paste emojis into your title description from Emojipedia . When in doubt, you can always use a few stars ⭐⭐⭐ in the title - it will be impossible to ignore your job posting ! Add a compelling job description with all the necessary information about the job and its requirements. Optimal Timings The best time to post a job is typically early in the morning - people tend to scroll online on social platforms while commuting to school/work. Perhaps you’ll grab the attention of someone who lives near your business and stuck hates their long commute. The exception is if you’re hiring for a job with late hours (e.g. 🍺 bartender, 🔒 night security guard, 🦇 vampire slayer). Post these types of jobs in the early afternoon for more views. Culture Details Write about what candidates can expect if they were to join your team. Share anything else your job candidates might be excited about, such as various learning and career development opportunities. Here are some suggestions: What makes your team special? How do you reward great employees? Have people on your team grown from this role into managerial roles? Do you cover education costs or provide any type of benefits? What made you get into this business in the first place / why are you a fun person to work with? Do they need to be in-person or can they work from home ? You can also add these culture details as additional reading through the Workstream dashboard - after applicants apply, you can set it up so they automatically receive a text message thanking them for the application and a link to company culture details. This way they remember who you are and get excited for coming in. Add Images Add your branding to give the job posting a professional look and increase click through rates. Include images of your happy team at the location and/or on a company bonding event. If you have a beautiful storefront, definitely include this - it will also make it easier for applicants to find you when they show up for interviews! Create Hyper-Local Job Ads Location tagging in your job listings can help you increase the chances of reaching the right audience by tagging to a specific location within your city. If the area where you're hiring for is highly competitive, such as Manhattan, you may consider posting your ad in adjacent areas, like Brooklyn or Queens. Ask yourself “where do many of my employees live” and “how do they get to work” … You can include a note in the job description such as “Easily commutable from Queens by taking the E train; we’re located 1 block from the 7th Ave stop!” The more contact information you get in your hyper-local Craigslist job posting the better. Track Applicants and Automate Follow-Up As the resumes and emails start pouring in, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. How do you weed through all the fake applicants / recruiter spam to identify people who are (1) legitimately interested, (2) qualified to do the job, and (3) a good cultural fit? We recommend adding an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) such as Workstream to organize all of the applicants. When you see someone who seems legit, you can move them to the next stage of the process and trigger an automated text message with screening questions and/or a link to your calendar to schedule an interview. The key here is speed - you need to remember that if a person is applying to your company, they’re likely applying to many others in a spray and pray approach. The company with the best often wins. Take a look at this 2-minute video from Chick-fil-A about how they automate their hiring process with an ATS.

However, for the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) vertical, the story has been quite the opposite . Sales are up, business is booming, and hiring has kept pace for QSRs throughout these pandemic months. We at Workstream work with thousands of QSR owners and hiring managers so we have a unique perspective on this thriving industry, and it’s been eye-opening to see how different their hiring needs have been from the rest of the US workforce. So unique that we collected data from these QSRs to provide our audience with a look into the U.S. Hiring Trends for the fall of 2020 . It’s Harder to Find Good Candidates The biggest takeaway from this survey is that QSRs are seeing increasing difficulty sourcing the right candidates to fill their open positions. One would think with high unemployment, filling open jobs would be a breeze, but that is not the case. For one, QSRs have always had a high turnover rate, and that has exacerbated with the pandemic due to fear or illness. Also, with more resumes coming in, finding the right candidate has become more difficult for many hiring managers. In fact, over 56% of the 3000+ QSR hiring managers surveyed said they had issues sourcing hourly workers as a result of the pandemic. And now with increasing seasonal demand from all businesses for delivery workers as the weather gets colder, we predict it will be even more competitive trying to hire great hourly employees in the coming months. New Hiring Problems Due to the Pandemic Other aspects of hiring have also become more difficult for QSR hiring managers including scheduling interviews (47%), training on new safety protocols (30%) and general onboarding (26%) . As teams scramble to enact new virtual interviewing software and video onboarding due to the social distancing required, there are new headaches arising for already busy managers. Luckily, the technological hurdle doesn’t seem like much of a problem as nearly 94% of respondents said that they could easily adopt video interviewing technology . This trend seems to be helping hiring managers process through more applicants in a shorter amount of time, which makes sense since it reduces commute time for the prospective employees (so they aren’t late or a no-show) and interviews are easier to set up back to back. These hiring managers are also leveraging much of the automation that a hiring platform like Workstream provides to handle these new pandemic-related problems. As virtual onboarding has become the new normal, we are seeing higher usage from these QSR managers using Workstream to manage virtual documents and get their new hires virtually training. More Applications Per Open Position Over a third of the survey respondents said they were seeing a surge in the number of applications per open position, while 58% said that they are seeing the same amount. It seems job-seekers know that QSRs are continuing to hire during this down economy, and they are overall applying more during this time. Yet, as mentioned earlier, these businesses are having a hard time sourcing good hourly workers. This means that it is getting more difficult weeding through the poor candidates to find the ones actually qualified for these positions. More resumes mean more bad resumes, so it’s no surprise these hiring managers are taking advantage of Workstream’s automated filtering methodology to find just the right candidates to interview. You can view our entire report that has more information here. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we at Workstream will continue to collect this hiring data to see where the industry is trending next.

Financial assistance has so far been insufficient and the distribution of aid has not been implemented as smoothly as we would have liked.. Let’s do a quick recap, shall we? The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on Mar 27 2020 , providing a $2 trillion relief fund for businesses. However, the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) President and CEO Chip Rogers said that the CARES Act is “unworkable for hoteliers” as it doesn’t consider actual operational costs. Meanwhile, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) , a crucial component of the CARES Act, isn’t doing too well either. From giant chains benefiting instead of smaller companies who are in dire need, to the extremely slow rate at which small businesses are receiving the funds, the PPP has been a disaster. Needless to say, government aid hasn’t been very useful. As some states begin to reopen businesses, hiring from a huge pool of laid-off and furloughed workers now poses a huge challenge administratively and financially. With the aforementioned forms of aid seemingly incapable of helping businesses much, what other alternatives can you turn to? Work Opportunity Tax Credit The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a Federal tax credit that aims to encourage employers to hire specific groups of people who have traditionally faced a lot of difficulties when looking for a job. Such groups include ex-felons, veterans, recipients of long-term family assistance - to name a few. Who is eligible? How to apply? (1) Fill out IRS Form 8850. Form 8850 (Pre-Screening Notice and Certification Request) is for pre-screening of employees and making a request to have the newly hired employee certified as one belonging to the WOTC target group. (2) Fill out ETA Form 9061. Form 9061 (Individual Characteristics Form) lists the individual characteristics of the worker. These include demographic data and other details which provide information on whether or not the applicant belongs to a WOTC target group. The ETA Form 9175 (Long-Term Unemployment Recipient Self-Attestation) should be used in the absence of unemployment insurance wage records. (3) Submit all forms. Forms must be submitted to the state workforce agency within 28 days after the new hire’s start date. Failure to do so will result in the application being denied. (4) Receive a determination. The state workforce agency will issue a final determination for each WOTC application. Additional information or documentation may be needed. Once an employer receives a certification, he/she can then claim the tax credit with the IRS. (5) Claim your tax credit. In general, an employer claims the tax credit by filling up Form 5884 (Work Opportunity Credit). But if the organization is exempted from taxes and is hiring from the veteran target group, he/she should fill up Form 5884-C (Work Opportunity Credit for Qualified Tax-Exempt Organizations Hiring Qualified Veterans) instead. How Much Can I Claim? Well, it depends on a few factors - the number of hours worked and the salary the hires receive. The amount of tax credit that can be claimed ranges from $1,200 to $9,600 . WOTC workers must have worked at least 120 hours in the first year of employment for their employers to qualify to claim the tax credit. Generally, the credit represents 25% of eligible workers' wages who work at least 120 hours in the first year. What’s Next? It’s clear by now that the US government isn’t the most efficient when it comes to distributing aid to all the businesses who are in desperate need of it right now. With so many businesses reopening in the coming weeks, hiring becomes a top priority even in a time when financial resources are tight. As a business owner, applying for the WOTC could just be the lifeline to help your business get through this tough period, as you can save some money while hiring at the same time.

Probably not! And we don’t blame you—especially after another chaotic year for businesses navigating the “new normal.” That’s why we want to help you out! In this article, we’ll be sharing five end-of-year tax tips for small business owners. Specifically, we’ll be sharing tax tips for small business owners running quick service restaurants. If that’s you, keep reading! Here’s a quick preview of the tips you’ll learn about: Review your tax requirements Audit your bookkeeping Take advantage of first-year bonus depreciation Check eligibility for tax credits Assess potential tax deductions And when we’re done going through those tips, we’ll also share some of our favorite end-of-year tax write-offs so that you can keep as much of your annual profits as possible! 5 End-of-Year Tax Tips for Small Businesses We know tax planning can be complicated and confusing. Here are five tax tips to help make your life easier as you close out the year. #1 Review Your Tax Requirements You might already be familiar with the tax requirements for your restaurant. But the end of the year is a good time to review and update yourself on any changes. Here are the key requirements to be aware of: As a restaurant owner, you need to pay federal income tax on your business and personal income. Depending on your location, you may also be required to pay state and local taxes. You need to pay federal payroll taxes on your employees’ wages to cover things like Medicare and Social Security. You’ll also need to pay state unemployment taxes for your employees. You’ll typically be required to pay the state and/or local government sales and use tax. #2 Audit Your Bookkeeping Bookkeeping is essential to any business. By keeping tabs on your profits and expenses, you save yourself time when it comes time to sort your taxes. It can also save you money! How? Tax write-offs! By filing for tax write-offs (like the ones we share later in this article), you can lower your taxable income. But you’d have a hard time finding the receipts you need to apply for those tax write-offs if you have to frantically go through a pile of papers on your desk. So, spend some time in these final months of 2021 reviewing and organizing your books. Think ahead by taking notes on which expenses might qualify for tax write-offs. And make digital copies of any physical receipts so that there’s no chance you’ll lose or misplace them. #3 Take Advantage of First-Year Bonus Depreciation Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) , you can get a 100% first-year bonus depreciation on qualified used and new assets (e.g. kitchen appliances) that you purchased and used during 2021. For this reason, you might also want to consider making planned purchases of new assets by December 31 to take full advantage of this bonus depreciation. However, note that buildings and their structural components are not eligible. And you have to start using whatever you buy before the end of this year. #4 Check Eligibility for Tax Credits Before the year ends, check to see if your restaurant is eligible for tax credits . What are those? Tax credits are, essentially, rewards for partaking in a business activity that benefits the economy, environment, or any other matter considered important by the government. If your business is eligible, tax credits can help you reduce the amount of income tax you have to pay to the federal and state governments. In some cases, you might even get a tax refund if the credit exceeds your tax bill. One of the most common tax credits is The Work Opportunity Tax Credit . This tax credit aims to help job seekers that have more difficult barriers in getting a job. If you are a business owner that hires people who usually face barriers to employment (e.g. veterans, ex-felons), you are likely eligible for this tax credit. Another tax credit you should know about is the Employee Retention Credit . This refundable tax credit is for businesses that have been impacted by COVID-19. If you have fully or partially suspended your restaurant operations by following government orders and experienced a 50% decline in sales compared to the same quarter in 2019, you should consider applying for this tax credit. Lastly, you should spend some time to make sure you understand tax deductions (also known as tax write-offs). Any of your expenses that are eligible for tax deductions can help to significantly lower your taxable income. #5 Assess Potential Tax Deductions For example, if you earned $50,000 of income in the calendar year and reported $2,500 of tax-deductible expenses, you’ll only pay taxes on $47,500 of business income. Doing this at the end of the year will not only save you a lot of time when it comes time to file taxes, but it will also ensure you don’t miss any write-offs that can save you money. Curious about what else you might be able to write off for tax deductions? 10 End-of-Year Tax Write-Offs for Small Business Owners Tax write-offs are expenses (approved by the IRS) that you can subtract from your taxable income. By filing your tax write-offs you can save money every year. But you have to know what to look for! Here are ten that you should be aware of as you review your books at the end of the year. #1 Depreciation You can write off the cost of your restaurant assets, such as ovens and dishwashers. In previous years, you could only write off a certain percentage. But in 2021 (as we mentioned above in tax tip #3), you can write off 100% of eligible purchases. #2 Marketing and Advertising Expenses You can include almost all of your marketing expenses (excluding any political ads) in your tax write-offs. For example, the money you spent on Google pay-per-click ads can be reported as deductible items. #3 Business Meals As a restaurant owner, you may occasionally provide meals to your employees. You can deduct up to 50% for food and beverage costs! #4 Insurance You probably have different insurance plans for your restaurant. For example, you probably have property insurance, liability insurance, and life insurance for your employees. When filing your taxes, you can deduct the premiums. #5 Salaries and Benefits In general, your employees’ salaries and benefits are tax-deductible as long as the employee is not a sole proprietor, a partner, or an LLC member. #6 Maintenance Expenses You can also write off maintenance expenses for your business, such as utilities, cleaning services, and structural repairs. #7 Rental Expenses If you rent the location of your restaurant, you can deduct the rental payments from your taxable income. On top of that, equipment rental, such as ovens and ice machines, also can be included under this deduction. #8 Employee Gifts Have you ever awarded an employee of the month and given that person a gift as a token of your appreciation? Employee gifts are deductible up to $25 per employee annually. #9 Software Subscriptions Cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications can be included in your tax deductions. So, if you have a subscription to a recruiting software like Workstream , you can deduct the costs from your taxable income. #10 Legal and Professional Fees Lastly, if you hire a bookkeeper, accountant, and/or lawyer for your restaurant, some of their professional fees are tax-deductible as well! Final Thoughts Filing taxes can be confusing and, at times, frustrating. But, by planning ahead, you can save yourself time and your business money! We hope the tax tips and write-offs we’ve shared help you feel confident in your end-of-year tax preparation.

Now that we're on the other side, businesses in QSR especially, have learned quite a few lessons on how to set their businesses up to withstand unforeseen circumstances. To ready your business for whatever the next big disruption to daily life is, consider these guidelines. 1. Be prepared to cater to increased demands Consumer behaviors and customer expectations can change in an instant. We've seen that firsthand. So how do you prepare your business for the unknown? When it comes to QSR scheduling, make sure you have the flexibility built in to be able to pivot your strategy quickly. This might mean pivoting some in-store staff to delivery driving or vice versa. When asked ' How often do you plan on dining out? ', 50.9% of those surveyed by VP Insiders felt like they would do the ' same as before ', while 45.9% chose ' less than before. ' It's still essential to ensure that there are sufficient staff on-ground, as manpower will also be required to maintain a safe environment for customers. 31.9% of customers have indicated that they are ' very likely ' to use ' curbside delivery ' as a service, whereas 18.2% chose ' extremely likely ' and 34.4% chose ' somewhat likely. '. By incorporating curbside delivery, you may be able to reach a greater base of customers, especially those who may not be willing to dine in, but are still a fan of your offerings. 2. Always put the safety of employees and customers first Some COVID-era safety precautions have stuck around and for good reason. When asked, ' Are disposable, single-use menus important to you? ' 58.7% indicated yes, implying that this is, in fact, something that customers would prefer. But why not take it a step further by providing digital menus that can easily be accessed by scanning a QR code? Customers can easily scan the menu, decide on what they want and immediately place an order online. Not only does this save the environment, but it also reduces the amount of surfaces your employees need to clean and your customers need to interact with. Another lesson the pandemic taught us, is that if you're sick, you should stay home. Gone are the days of sucking up a cold to get hours in, especially in the restaurant industry. Having a QSR scheduling system in place that allows your employees to easily swap shifts on their own makes it easier for employees to take a sick day without feeling guilty. 3. Manage your manpower It's always better to be overstaffed than understaffed. It enables you to continue to provide the same level of customer service and experience , even when your staff may be sick or some unforeseen circumstance suddenly increases demand. Here are some recommendations to help you combat any QSR scheduling crisis. Make applying and hiring simple (for applicants and your team) Through text-to-apply posters , not only can you utilize your physical stores to publicize new job openings, the application process is also convenient and quick! Visitors can scan the QR code on these posters, or text the number displayed to get a link to all open positions. Job board integrations will also help simplify the hiring process, as hiring managers no longer have to copy and paste to multiple job boards. Instead, they can post to over 25,000 job boards with a single click and view all applicants within a single dashboard. Artificial intelligence is also used to optimize your job postings across multiple boards to ensure that job posts are shown to 10 times as many job seekers. Move online (and maximize technology) If increased demand for your service makes it hard to hold physical interviews, why not get applicants to submit a video resume instead? Not only does it set the application process apart from others, but it's also an easy way to narrow down applicants who are genuinely interested in the role. The best part? No more having to sift through hundreds of boring resumes! Automated scheduling is another feature that you should consider. With a QSR scheduling app, you can select candidates you'd like to meet, and they instantly get a text message link to your calendar (with pre-allocated time slots) to schedule a Zoom meeting. They will be able to choose a time that best suits their availability and get reminders closer to the interview date. In the event that something crops up at the last minute, they will also be given the option of rescheduling, effectively preventing ghosting. Create a seamless onboarding processes When you've finally secured a candidate, have an entirely paperless onboarding process by uploading documents online, collecting and storing electronic signatures and setting up trigger alerts for incomplete paperwork. Mobile training is an effective way to onboard new staff, as you may send handbooks, checklists and training videos via a text message link, which makes these documents easily accessible. SMS reminders will also be sent to guarantee completion. 4. Create an online presence through social media marketing and word of mouth Finally, how can you market your brand to reach your target consumers? More people are turning to their mobile devices to search for best dining spots, widely reviewed locations, and good deals. This is further highlighted through customers' responses to the question 'What's the most effective way restaurants can market their offers to you,' with 27.1% choosing text messaging marketing and 23.3% opting for social media. Running engaging campaigns, encouraging followers to share your posts and having giveaways are just some ways to increase awareness and brand loyalty on social media . Paying for ads and boosting your posts is another option to reach a greater audience beyond those currently following your brand. Most importantly, never underestimate the power of reviews or word of mouth. A 4-5 star review goes a long way, while a 1-star review may also significantly impact your brand image. By maintaining a certain standard of customer service and satisfaction, customers are bound to come back for more. Still unsure of how to apply these tips to your QSR?

While you can't control everything when it comes to hiring and retaining restaurant employees, having a thoughtful interview process is one of the best ways to ensure you're hiring applicants that are qualified for the job, passionate about the role and your business, and committed to sticking around. To help you prepare to interview restaurant staff, we've put together a list of 15 restaurant interview questions you need to ask every potential new hire. We’ll tell you why this questions are so critical to helping you find the right employee, and also help you identify the answers you should be looking for. But before we get into all of that, it’s important to understand why finding good restaurant employees is so challenging right now. Consider the challenges hourly workers have had to go through recently and ensure you're providing opportunities, benefits, and flexibility to attract quality employees in the first place. Why is it so hard to find hourly employees? You’re not the only one struggling to find good hourly employees right now. According to a September 2021 data report by Restaurant Dive, 26% of restaurants were looking for cooks and line cooks, 17% were looking for servers, and 7% were looking for bartenders. What’s causing the labor shortage? The new normal. The pandemic has changed how we live. And hourly workers want higher pay, more flexibility in their schedule, and employee benefits that reflect our new reality. And businesses are stepping up to the plate. Not only are wages getting more competitive, but employers are finding new, creative ways to attract (and retain!) workers like paid time off, education reimbursements,  paid childcare, and more. So before you post an open job and start reviewing applications, ensure you're providing an attractive and competitive employee experience. Only then, will the following restaurant interview questions be able to help you determine if an applicant is the right fit for your open role. 15 restaurant interview questions you should be asking During a restaurant interview, you should be asking questions that not only validate an applicant's skills and experience but also give you an indication of their commitment to the job. The following 15 restaurant interview questions will help you: Find applicants who are serious and committed to doing the job well Weed out the candidates who are more likely to turnover Prepare for your next restaurant interview by becoming acquainted with the most common restaurant interview questions and the answers you should be looking for. 1. Can you tell me a bit about yourself? This is a basic but important restaurant interview question. It allows potential employees to talk about themselves and get comfortable at the beginning of the interview. It also gives you, the interviewer, a general understanding of the interviewee without restricting them to any topic. Specifically, you should listen to discover information and details that are not mentioned in their resume. This is a good way to learn about any auxiliary skills or characteristics that could lend themselves to the job.  It’s also a good chance to learn about the interviewee’s personality, particularly how they carry themselves when meeting a stranger—an important trait to succeed in the restaurant industry before, during, and after the pandemic. 2. Why do you want to work in the restaurant industry? You know there are pros and cons to the restaurant industry. And everyone will have different motives for choosing this line of work. This restaurant interview question will guide the interviewee to express how this job fits with their short and long-term goals. As they answer, listen to how they describe their feelings and thoughts about the restaurant industry. Do they think of it as a short-term gig? Do they want to progress through different stages of a restaurant career, be it with your restaurant or others? Do they love food or customer service or bartending? Try to tie their answer back to your current hiring objective to see if they're a match for the role. Every hire you make won't have a deep passion for the restaurant industry, and that's OK. But if an applicant does want to turn this line of work into a long career, you may save yourself from experiencing quick turnover. 3. Why do you want to work at our restaurant over others? As we mentioned previously, restaurants all around the country are struggling to find employees now due to a nationwide labor shortage. So, the interviewee probably has many options. This restaurant interview question can help you to further understand why they’ve chosen to apply for a job at your restaurant. This restaurant interview question could also help you understand if they have done enough research about your company. Based on their answers, you can have an idea if they fit with your restaurant's mission, vision, and workplace culture. And you'll also learn if they'll get along well with the rest of your staff. On top of that, you may discover what your competitive edges are in the market that draws applicants to you—details you can use to update your job description and make it more enticing to future applicants. 4. What do you know about our restaurant? Yes, this fast food interview question is similar to the one above but it might also reveal new, important information. For one thing, it will help you distinguish between a well-prepared candidate and an apply-to-all-jobs candidate. 5. Do you have any prior experience in the restaurant industry? This is another common fast food interview question that will help you understand what expertise the interviewee brings to the table and which of their skills might be transferable to the role you’re hiring for. Look for answers that demonstrate desirable skills, such as their proficiency in using POS systems or other emerging technologies in the restaurant industry . Their answer will help you determine how much training you may need to provide if they're hired or if they have added experience that isn't necessary to the role, but could support your business in different ways. If you're lucky, you might only need to give them a refresher instead of comprehensive training during onboarding! 6. How well do you work under pressure? We all know that working in a restaurant is not easy. The labor shortage might also put additional pressure on restaurant operations, making things a bit unpredictable. This food service interview question lets you know how flexible and resilient the interviewee is at work. Look for more than one-word answers here. Give the applicant the opportunity to talk through different real-life scenarios where they've had to manage high-pressure situations and prioritize competing tasks. 7. Tell me about a time you had to deal with demanding customers in a restaurant. How did you resolve the issue? Every restaurant will always have customers that occasionally act out of line. No employee can prevent those troublesome occurrences from happening. But there are a variety of ways to resolve those conflicts, some more professional and effective than others. This food service interview question gives you a chance to see if the candidate knows how to handle stressful situations without jeopardizing your business. Look for candidates that not only have their own ways to resolve conflicts and ensure excellent customer service , but also know how to seek help and raise concerns at the right time. 8. What does excellent customer service mean to you? The word “excellent” is subjective. What it means to you and the candidate could be drastically different. This question allows you to see if their idea of customer service is aligned with your restaurant’s standards. Given the current situation, also try to dig for examples of times the candidate has given excellent customer service in a variety of settings. For example, what does customer service look like to them when speaking over the phone, by email, by text, or in-person? Their approach to customer service using these different mediums may not be the same. 9. How would you resolve a conflict with your coworkers? Running a restaurant is not a one-man show. It’s a collective effort from customer-facing employees, kitchen staff, and administration. And occasional conflicts among coworkers are to be expected. This interview question will help you gauge how well the candidate can work with others, whether they are a team player, and how they might influence your work culture. Look for answers that focus on resolution instead of the problem or people. 10. What digital tools have you used in previous restaurant jobs? As a result of how Covid has changed consumer behavior, the restaurant industry is undergoing a digital transformation . Technology such as third-party order apps (e.g. Uber Eats) and self-ordering kiosks will be more common in the years to come. All of this makes digital literacy a crucial skill for restaurant workers in 2021 and beyond. Ask this restaurant interview question to see if the candidate would be comfortable using the digital tools your restaurant is currently using and how they might approach learning about new technology in the future. 11. What hours are you available to work? This is a fundamental question that is important now more than ever. As you know by now, adapting your restaurant operation strategy can be a continuous process to get right during the pandemic. Having a clear idea of their availability will help you in planning your restaurant hours and resources. Your goal with this question is to find someone that can cover the standard shifts while remaining flexible if needed. 12. How do you feel about working extra shifts? This question surely feels similar to the previous one. So, why ask it? Because it’s not enough to know if they’re available to work extra shifts. You also need to know how it might affect their feelings towards the job. Knowing this is key to finding employees that will stay with you long-term. Of course, it’s important to know there is no right or wrong answer to this question. And you should encourage the interviewee to be honest. But applicants with more flexibility will likely be better suited to accommodate your restaurant’s changing needs throughout the remainder of the pandemic. 13. What are your career goals? There are millions of people that work full-time careers in the restaurant industry, while there are some that work part-time or temporarily before landing a job they truly want. So, the goal of this interview question isn’t to find someone who will stay in this industry or your restaurant forever. Rather, you’re looking for someone honest with their objectives. Based on the candidate’s answer, you’ll also get a better idea if they are a good fit for the current position and how they might help you build your restaurant in the long term. 14. How would you handle a customer who refuses to comply with Covid-19 safety procedures? As you know, there are Covid-19 safety guidelines that restaurants should follow to keep workers and consumers as safe as possible. But, as you also know, occasionally there could be customers who are not willing to cooperate. This restaurant interview question will help you ensure the candidate is willing to enforce the rules. Ideally, they should strive to do this while upholding your restaurant’s standard for customer service. Look for candidates that aim to explain the restaurant’s policies and the importance of upholding them without giving in to difficult customers. 15. Do you have any questions for me? Last, but not least, this interview question allows the interviewee to ask you any questions about you and how you run your restaurant. Pay careful attention to the types of questions they ask. Are their questions generic or relevant to the job? Either way, you’ll gain insight into how serious they are about getting the job and performing well if hired. Final thoughts You’ve likely adapted many parts of your restaurant operations to keep up with all of the pandemic-related changes. Don’t neglect to do the same for your hiring process, including the types of questions you ask. You can use the 15 restaurant interview questions we’ve shared here to quickly achieve that goal! For easy reference, here are those questions again: Can you tell me a bit about yourself? Why do you want to work in the restaurant industry? Why do you want to work at our restaurant over others? What do you know about our restaurant? Do you have any prior experience in the restaurant industry? How well do you work under pressure? Tell me about a time you had to deal with demanding customers in a restaurant. How did you resolve the issue? What does excellent customer service mean to you? How would you resolve a conflict with your coworkers? What digital tools have you used in previous restaurant jobs? What hours are you available to work? How do you feel about working extra shifts? What are your career goals? How would you handle a customer who refuses to comply with COVID-19 safety procedures? Do you have any questions for me?

The short answer is that it's very important. So what can you do to improve customer service in your QSR? We’ve shortlisted some statistics and tips for QSRs on how you can achieve top-tier customer service and benefit from it. These include how to increase customer satisfaction in various areas alongside best practices from some of the leading QSRs regarding customer service. The importance of customer service and satisfaction In a recent analysis, it was found that 81% of customers will return if they have a positive experience at your business. At QSRs, good customer service contributes to positive experiences, more positive reviews, and better revenue. However, customer satisfaction has been dropping across America by 1.3% compared to 2018 . With customers having higher expectations when it comes to customer service, these results should not come as a shock. But this also shows that it is an opportunity to build your QSR’s reputation when it comes to good customer service, which can be a key differentiating factor from your competitors. Working on Customer Service Now that you realize the importance of customer service, it is time to look into how you can incorporate it into your QSR. You can look at several areas, broadly categorized into the following buckets: employee training and culture, digitization, and customer experience. Employee training and culture Employee training The root of customer service is your employees. It's crucial that they receive sufficient training for them to be aware of the standard expected by your QSR and how to deal with customers when the need arises. Starbucks is an example of a QSR with well-recognized training, utilizing a 70/20/10 approach. 70% of their training involves learning on-the-job, 20% from supervisor feedback and mentorship, and 10% through online e-learning. You can send handbooks, checklists, and training videos via mobile training via a text message link, allowing employees to access them anytime and anywhere. Hiring managers can review completion rates and send SMS reminders to guarantee completion. Some topics that could potentially be covered in onboarding and training include greeting diners, how to deal with customers, familiarity with the menu, proper etiquette when it comes to service, and service procedures such as bringing the check and how to use the POS system. Employees at QSRs should also be tested on this information after their onboarding to allow them to apply what they’ve learned from the onboarding materials in a real-life context. Conduct occasional tests and checks, such as engaging a ‘mystery shopper,’ to ensure that service is consistent across the board, even in different outlets. Having a holistic culture You must create a holistic culture within your QSR. Enjoying what they do and having a positive work environment contribute to employee satisfaction, which is then manifested in how they treat your customers. Consider having employee recognition programs to reward good customer service and contributions or bonding days to allow employees to foster closer relationships with their teams. Creating a safe environment will also allow employees to be vocal about their thoughts and provide feedback that can help improve the service levels at your QSR. McDonald’s achieves this by providing flexible work schedules to their quick-service restaurant employees, alongside performance-based remuneration, to encourage staff to meet their financial goals. Not only do these serve as an incentive for employees to give their all at work, but they are also likely to stay in the organization for longer. Digitization Based on a survey conducted by Panasonic, 71% of respondents stated that digital transformation is far more important than any other factor, for business agility. Covid-19 has definitely spurred digitization in the QSR industry , but how does digitization play a role in customer service? As people are increasingly busy, many prioritize speed and efficiency of service. This is where online reservations, mobile orders, and contactless ordering come in. Customers are able to place their orders and immediately pick them up with little to no waiting time because they’re alerted only when the food is ready. Queue numbers and buzzers will also solve the issue of long wait times, which could contribute to a positive experience as customers a rough idea of when they can expect their food. On a similar note, MOOYAH implemented a refreshed kitchen display system to facilitate communications between the cashier and the kitchen. This allowed those at the register to focus on keying in the right order. Fewer slip-ups mean greater customer satisfaction. Additionally, QR code and digital menus are a Covid-19 friendly option, as they are easily accessible and unlike physical menus, do not pass through many hands in the span of a day. Often overlooked, the regular maintenance of machines and tech products is also crucial - ensure that everything is in working order to reduce instances of sudden breakdowns. Prioritizing the Customer Experience When everything else mentioned in front has been taken care of, it brings us to the final (and most important segment) of customer service. By prioritizing the customer experience, customers leave happy . Think of ways to surprise them and evoking a positive experience. This doesn’t necessarily have to be complicated, simple gestures like providing activities for kids, wifi access or even having a TV in the waiting area keeps them busy during the wait time. When customers are preoccupied, they are less likely to be in a hurry to receive their order. Chick-fil-A is an excellent example of a QSR with a great customer experience , as fans are happy with their customer service, polite employees, and cleanliness. Their staff is trained to manage customers, to create a warm and inviting environment, even offering free food to create the best experience. Personally, one of my best QSR encounters was also in their store, where a staff at the register initiated a conversation about photography when he saw the camera hung around my neck. Although it was a simple gesture, his friendly demeanor made it feel like I wasn’t just at a regular fast-food restaurant, and it was a pleasant and memorable experience. Customer Complaints and Encouraging Feedback Employees should be trained to deal with complaints by responding immediately and offering additional discounts or freebies when necessary to do damage control. Comment cards are also effective for obtaining feedback and are a good opportunity to figure out how to improve on your QSR’s customer service standards. Consider encouraging customers to leave reviews or social media posts about their experience, which can help in raising awareness of the customer service in your QSR. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Top it all off with an all-around Customer Relationship Management system , by providing personalized services through loyalty programs. This will allow you to obtain insights into each customer’s preferences and purchasing behavior. Your employees can then make relevant recommendations to increase customer satisfaction, and create a personalized customer experience as a part of customer service. Tiered membership and reward programs will also encourage revisits, alongside EDMs to inform customers of new promotions or menu items. By incorporating these in your QSR, customers are likely to be loyal to your brand as they feel valued, thus increasing customer satisfaction. Summing Up The above tips should give your QSR a head-start in improving your customer service and create a memorable experience for all customers. While it may not seem complicated, it is necessary that you ensure the standards are consistent across all franchises for customers to associate it with your brand name.

Keeping your talent pipelines full for your DMs and GMs can feel like mission impossible at times, especially without best practices in place. But there’s an opportunity right in front of you that may not always be top of mind: promoting talent from within your restaurants. Perhaps there isn’t an ideal candidate on your team who can fill a management role when it becomes available. The good news is that this is a solvable problem. As a VP of operations, you can work carefully with your DMs and GMs to put development programs into place so that your team members grow the right skills to become future leaders of your restaurants. In this article, we take a closer look at four advantages of promoting talent from within your restaurants. 4 benefits of hiring internally 1. The entire team will see that loyalty and hard work really do get rewarded. When restaurants promote from within, employees see that hard work pays off. One of the greatest benefits from this is higher retention rates. As VP of operations, you know firsthand that employee retention is one of the biggest problems in the industry. Growing your team into leadership roles is a win-win. When your employees see that they have the ability to grow their careers with your restaurant, they not only stick around longer, employee engagement also increases . Having a strong culture of internal promotion is also fantastic for attracting new applicants. People looking for their next career opportunity are attracted to brands known for promoting from within because they believe that if they join the team and work hard, good results for their careers will follow. 2. Internal candidates already know the organization inside and out. Months, and in some cases years, of knowledge about your QSR brand and culture can be invaluable to your restaurants’ long-term success. An external hire won’t have this frontline experience gained along the way—in good times and bad. Not only is this valuable knowledge missing from external hires, it also gets lost if employees leave your restaurant because they weren’t promoted. There’s no denying that an external candidate can bring a much-needed, fresh perspective to a restaurant. But, in cases where the team is functioning well, an internal promotion will carry substantial brand and culture benefits that an external candidate simply can’t bring to the table from day one. 3. The restaurant will reach optimal performance more quickly. Getting someone started in a new role at your restaurant usually isn’t easy, but if the person is internal, the change will be easier for everyone involved. Hiring an external candidate means that new team member will have to learn the core functions of the job. It also means it will take extra time to become familiar with all the detailed nuances that inevitably arise even in the most organized training programs. Plus, the external hire will have to build relationships with other team members from scratch. Additionally, the external hire will have to learn how to navigate the restaurant’s policies and procedures for topics such as shift schedules, dress codes and time-off requests. This can include training an external hire to operate various technology systems that are increasingly being used by QSRs today. As an external hire ascends these experiential learning curves within your restaurants, the ramp-up time is not always smooth sailing. Bumps along the way can cause ripple effects that upset other team members who are already under stress and don’t have extra capacity to tolerate rookie mistakes. Having experience in how your restaurants truly operate gives internal candidates a big advantage when it comes to achieving optimal job performance as quickly as possible. 4. The restaurant will realize substantial cost savings by not having to recruit external talent. As a VP of operations, you know that the budget you allocate for recruiting talent for your restaurant. It’s often sizable. Investing in ongoing hiring campaigns requires substantial advertising and marketing dollars. These recruitment expenses increase the overall cost of external hires compared to internal promotions. The more time it takes to fill open roles at your restaurants, the larger your recruitment marketing and advertising expenses will be. And for team leader and management positions, recruitment efforts can take even longer and cost more money in the long run. Plus, there is a greater chance that an external hire will quit prematurely compared to an internal promotion because external hires may discover that they don’t like the culture of the restaurant. When an external hire quits prematurely, this is considered a loss, as all the time and money spent training this person fails to generate a return on investment for the restaurant. Instead of spending this money recruiting external candidates, consider investing more in management development and job shadowing programs for internal team members. These developmental investments will help your restaurant identify employees who are competent, hardworking and ready to take on more responsibility. While promoting from within has many significant advantages, external recruitment and hiring is still very much a necessity.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 04/12/23 Best exit interview questions for hiring managers Share this article Exit interviews can be some of the most informative conversations hiring managers have with a soon-to-be ex-employee. They bring to light underlying problems and valuable information leaders may not know about and enable them to gather insights into the effectiveness of company procedures, including employee’s satisfaction with the benefits package. Moreover, exit interviews play a pivotal role in understanding and improving company culture, employee retention, and employee engagement. So, why are exit interview questions so important? In April of 2021 alone, 4 million people quit their jobs and another 3.6 million did so in May. Over 40% of HR professionals have also indicated that their organizations have seen higher or much higher turnover in the past six months. Hiring and/or firing employees is costly, so it's crucial for employers to examine what changes they should make in their organization to reduce turnover rates and retain their current employees . These interviews are valuable opportunities for employees to provide honest feedback and letting you know what changes can you do in work environment . Exit interviews offer a unique and motivating opportunity to understand the employee’s decision to leave and gather feedback on their experiences within the organization. By understanding the reasons behind an employee's resignation, management will begin to figure out what went wrong within the organization and how to plug the gaps for future employees , reduce future terminations, and how employee engagement can be improved. The effectiveness of exit interviews relies on the use of open-ended questions , which prompt employees to share detailed feedback about working conditions and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of organizational dynamics. Moreover, understanding the perspectives of new employees for a new role can provide valuable insights into the onboarding process and the transition into a new position . How to prepare for an exit interview The best exit interviews are the ones that have been strategized and planned out before they occur. Having an exit interview template , exit survey , and the right exit interview questions (more on this later) will make it easier to conduct and collect the appropriate information from these interviews and getting constructive feedback . Tailor your exit interview questions so you can gather as many actionable insights as possible. Furthermore, when preparing for exit interviews, consider how company culture impacts employee feedback , retention strategies, and former employees feedback. Exit interviews should be mandatory for a certain level of employee at your company. Usually, these are salaried professionals, executives, and other mid-to-high-level roles. But you should also require them for roles within your company that experience a high turnover rate. If many first-year employees choose to leave, you may want to prepare exit interview questions for all levels of workers. ( Pro tip: Put this policy in writing in your employee handbook, stressing that it’s a mandatory company policy so no one is surprised when they receive a request for an exit interview.) Ensure that an appropriate interviewer is selected, ideally from a team of human resource , to obtain unbiased insights. This will also increase the chances of the exiting employee sharing information they may not feel comfortable sharing with a direct team member . The timing of the exit interview is important as well since doing it too early can make the meeting overly emotional. Hosting it too late in the day can result in the employee mentally “checking out” from the role altogether and thus not sharing meaningful responses. Usually, the best time to ask exit interview questions is a week after the employee announces their intention to quit . Professional job description A professional and clear job description is crucial for effective exit interviews . It provides departing employees with clear expectations and helps managers evaluate performance. By referencing new job duties, it facilitates insightful feedback on the employee's experiences and contributions. Moreover, it reflects the organization's commitment to professionalism and attention to detail in employee transitions. Exit interview tips Dos When conducting exit interviews, it's best to meet the employee in person to witness both their visual and non-visual cues and highlight the importance of, and sincerity in, the exit interview. Let the employee know the reason behind the interview so they can provide you with information and realize that they have the power to make a difference. Creating an exit interview template that asks each employee the same exit interview questions will also help uncover patterns and trends, allowing your organization to gather deeper insights. Prepare an environment that promotes open communication and honest feedback . During the exit interview, inquire about the employee’s experiences leading up to their last day , including any challenges they may have faced, their performance review , or the successes they have achieved. Make it clear they don't have to provide an answer if they're uncomfortable with it because, ultimately, it's an opportunity for them to share their thoughts, and they have the right to decline to answer. Ask departing employees for feedback on factors contributing to employee turnover, such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and opportunities for advancement. Most importantly, follow the protocol and investigate for allegations of misconduct should there be any brought up during the exit interview instead of letting it slide because the employee is leaving. During exit interviews, ensure a focus on preserving and enhancing company culture to address underlying issues effectively. Don'ts You should not address office gossip during the exit interview or express your opinion in this face-to-face interview. Listen to what they have to say and withhold judgment. It’s supposed to be a safe space for them to be comfortable and share their thoughts in this offboarding process . Do not ask them to reconsider because the purpose of the interview is to discover more about their experience rather than to convince them to stay. Don't make promises you can't keep. While exit interview questions are a great opportunity to collect information from your soon-to-be-ex-employee, it's also an opportunity for them to request things from you like a good recommendation or even help landing a job in the future. While exit interviews aren't often used against employers, making promises you don't uphold can put you in hot water. Keep your conversations focused on their experience. 12 common exit interview questions to ask The following twelve employee exit interview questions have been designed to be a widening funnel, starting very specific to the employee and then gradually widening to encompass the entire company. It eventually wraps up at the end, circling back to the employee. Let’s explore few sample exit interview questions . 1. What prompted your decision to leave your position? 2. Were your goals and objectives clear and manageable? 3. What was your relationship like with your manager and colleagues? 4. What do you feel the company is doing poorly? 5. What did you enjoy about your time here? 6. Did you feel you were valued at our company? 7. How can we make this position better for your replacement? 8. Do you have any advice for the person we hire for your position? 9. What would make this a better place to work? 10. Would you recommend working at our company to your peers? 11. What are you looking forward to at your new job? 12. Do you have any suggestions for improvement in the company culture or work environment? Let’s quickly examine the rationale behind each exit interview question. 1. What prompted your decision to leave your position? An obvious question, but also an important one. Note that you should use the words “what prompted” instead of “why did you” intentionally. This allows the hiring manager to get to the root of the moment that “broke the camel’s back.” While it’s important to know if they were unhappy for a long time, it can be more actionable to know the specific reason the employee decided it was time to leave. 2. Were your goals and objectives clear and manageable? If compensation isn’t the problem, then the root cause is often that the employee was doing work they didn’t enjoy. This exit interview question aims to get specific about their position and whether they felt bored or overwhelmed. It also hints toward their experience with their direct superior, which acts as a segway to the next question. 3. What was your relationship like with your manager and colleagues? It’s a myth that people quit mostly due to their direct boss or coworkers. Rather, research has shown that people are more likely to quit after a \"turnover shock,\" which happens when they reflect on their job satisfaction due to a life event—and the COVID-19 pandemic is one such reason. Still, it’s important to probe their relationships with those in their immediate working circle in case of any friction. We're including the mention of coworkers as there is a possibility that one bad coworker is the reason for their resignation, and it’s important to determine who this individual is before more people start leaving for the same reason. A potential follow-up question in such a situation could be, \"Do any of your colleagues feel the same way?\" This is also why an HR manager should be conducting these interviews. 4. What do you feel the company is doing poorly? This gets into the specifics of the culmination of factors leading up to their decision—from poor work-life balance to low salary and even unfulfilling work. It’s unlikely that one specific event led to them choosing to leave the job, and finding out what these pain points are allows you to work on the cracks that may be forming within the business. The answer to this will be very telling. If many of your exit interview questions receive the same root answer (ie. higher salary, better benefits, terrible boss, etc.) then you know exactly what you need to fix to retain your talent. 5. What did you enjoy about your time here? On the flip side, it's also helpful to find out areas where your organization is doing well. From employee benefits to a great organizational culture, you'll be able to understand what's working and if your organization was able to effectively meet your employee's needs . If the employee is having difficulty coming up with an answer, it's a red flag that signals a need to look into employee satisfaction and wellbeing. 6. Did you feel you were valued at our company? If lacking development opportunities is the number one reason people quit, this question asks if they think their talent and skill set was wasted. This midpoint question is extremely important for retention, so spend time on this one and ask follow-ups to see where they could have felt better put to use and shown value. 7. How can we make this position better for your replacement? This is a carefully worded question basically asking how their own position could have been better for themselves, but framed in the context of being altruistic with the next hire. By positioning them to be a “mentor” in this way, the employee may consider more ideas in order to help the incoming candidate. 8. Do you have any advice for the person we hire for your position? More than any other question, this could be the best way to obtain indirect cues about how your employee felt about their job and role. The information could also be crucial in helping the new hire onboard more seamlessly or understand how else to change the job description so that the applicants can have a heads up of what the role requires and be a better fit. 9. What would make this a better place to work? This is the “widest” question to ask, giving them an open opportunity to touch on aspects of company culture, company leadership, benefits, and anything else outside of the scope of their specific role. Wider questions lead to differentiated answers, so the results may not be immediately actionable, but if you hear the same responses enough times, you’ll know what to fix. 10. Would you recommend working at our company to your peers? This exit interview question is asking for your company’s report card. If they’re willing to go out on a limb and recommend working here to their professional network, then not only are you parting on good terms, but they can also be a source of recruitment. [Bonus question] 11. Would you consider working for us again in the future? This question brings it back to the individual and offers the possibility of an open door to the company. Psychologically, this can make the “break up” easier, but receiving a firm “no” is a red flag as to their unhappiness. Follow up with exit interview questions that ask if making the right changes can court them back, and if not, why. [Bonus question] 12. Do you have any other issues you’d like to discuss? The doorknob question , in essence. It’s their last chance to air any other grievances. Once they know the interview is ending, they might get more candid. Finally, after the in-person exit interview, consider following up with a phone call or email version of a short secondary exit interview. Studies have shown that after some time, the employee’s reasons for leaving can change. They may have a clearer perspective on things or may feel freer to speak even more candidly. This post-exit interview can be another great way to learn more actionable items from a departing employee. The purpose of exit interviews is to benefit your overall company’s retention rate and culture, as long as they are conducted with actionable goals in mind. These twelve exit interview questions will help you part ways with your employee in a smart, professional, and insightful way. Frequently asked questions How Effective is Social Media for Hiring? Social media can be highly effective for hiring, offering broad reach and targeted audience engagement. It allows companies to showcase their brand, culture, and job opportunities to a vast pool of candidates. Why not just use LinkedIn? While LinkedIn is a powerful platform for professional networking and job searching, relying solely on it may limit your reach. Utilizing other social media channels can help tap into diverse talent pools and attract candidates who may not be active on LinkedIn. How do I write a job post? Writing a job post involves crafting a clear and engaging description of the job role, responsibilities, and requirements. It's essential to highlight what makes your company unique and why someone would want to work there. Keep it concise, informative, and tailored to your target audience. What strategies can I use to recruit employees through Facebook? To recruit employees through Facebook, consider creating engaging content about your company culture , job opportunities, and employee testimonials. Utilize targeted advertising to reach specific demographics and join relevant groups or communities to network with potential candidates. What are the best strategies for recruiting employees on Facebook? The best strategies for recruiting on Facebook involve creating compelling visual content, utilizing Facebook's job posting features, engaging with followers through comments and messages, and leveraging employee referrals. Additionally, consider using Facebook Insights to track the performance of your recruitment efforts and adjust your strategy accordingl Looking for other ways to optimize your recruitment strategy?

While each of these is either a triumph or a tragedy on its own, the numbers make up some rather fascinating statistics that employers and hiring managers should be aware of. Here are the top ten you should keep in mind as you build your HR strategy. 1. Firing an employee can cost employers up to 200% of the employee’s annual pay Exiting an employee from your company is hard for the employee—and for your business. While you’re working to backfill the open role, you’re incurring costs to hire a new team member in the form of both hard and fixed costs, like interviewing time, training, and (potentially) recruiter fees. With a vacated position, you’re also paying the cost of lowered productivity. Once you make the hire, you’re not in the clear yet. Your new hire will also need time to reach the same level of productivity as the previous employee, who may have had months or years of experience in their role to build up their proficiency. An often forgotten cost of letting an employee go is social capital. Relationships between employees take time to build and impact your team’s productivity. It’s important for your team to understand each other’s personalities and working styles, and that doesn’t happen overnight. Your team will need time to build trust and rapport. So, how much do these costs add up to? It depends on the seniority and pay grade. The cost of replacing an employee who earns less than $30,000 a year starts at 16% of their annual pay . To backfill a more senior employee, you could be paying up to 213% . 2. An employee lawsuit can cost companies more than $100,000 Wrongful termination can lead to some expensive lawsuits if the employee is inclined to pursue legal recourse. For reference, the average settlement costs in California is $40,000 but can range from $5,000 to more than $100,000 depending on the situation. And this doesn’t include additional fees such as punitive damages, attorney and court fees, and other compensatory damages. The costs don’t stop there. If the employee has a lawyer, the attorney can expect to receive compensation (via settlement or award) 64% of the time . With sky-high costs like this, it’s incredibly important to do everything by the book when deciding to let an employee go. 3. Nearly 23% of new hires leave before their first anniversary Most companies carefully interview and vet candidates before hiring them, but it’s often hard to detect whether or not the new hire will find success or not. A staggering 23% of new hires turnover before their first anniversary , while 46% of all new hires fail before 18 months . “Fail” here is a broad word to describe not performing to expectations, which generally leads to either discipline or a firing. This could also be that the company didn’t provide adequate training or onboarding. Or it could be that… 4. 78% of job seekers lie during the hiring process Candidates are likely to oversell their abilities to secure a job offer, and findings have shown that 78% of candidates lie on their resumes to set themselves apart from others. Some of these include having a mastery of skills they may not have (such as Excel or a foreign language), having a higher GPA, working at a company longer than they did, or even earning a degree from a prestigious university (when all they did was take a class online). While hiring managers may be willing to overlook some of these lies because they don’t prevent the employee from fulfilling the role’s requirements, lying on a resume could also have serious consequences. When a candidate lies about their college degree or is unable to perform to the standards of the job, the term of employment is often short. 5. 96% of HR and hiring professionals believe that employee experience is important Gone are the days where employees conform to what employers need. Now, organizations are expected to understand and invest in their workers to create a better working experience. In fact, 96% of HR and hiring professionals surveyed for LinkedIn's Global Talent Trends report believe that employee experience is becoming more important. Today, organizations are elevating the employee experience by focusing on compensation and benefits, management strategies, and even employee training . They’re also gathering insights about what their employees want and need the most . 6. 81% of talent professionals agree virtual recruiting will continue Virtual hiring is on the rise, especially with Covid-19 drastically changing the way organizations run and work. Today, 81% of recruiters agree that virtual recruiting will continue post-Covid-19, while 70% say that virtual recruiting will become the new standard. Candidates can expect fully virtual recruitment and onboarding processes, while businesses are left to develop engaging ways to onboard their employees as seamlessly as possible. From text message recruiting to video interviews and even mobile onboarding , technology is the future of recruiting—and it’s likely here to stay. 7. Turnover rate is at 144% for fast-food restaurants The turnover rate for QSRs is astonishingly high, which has increased from 135% two years ago to 144% . To put this into context, a restaurant with 30 staff will have 43 people leaving in a single month. This puts the spotlight on hiring effectively and understanding the needs of employees to reduce turnover rates. There may also be a need to look into creative recruitment strategies to hire quickly, and digitalization to ensure that your organization continues to be attractive to candidates. 8. 51% view internal mobility as a priority A LinkedIn report highlighted another good way to increase employee retention: hire internally. Promoting from within, or allowing an employee to move laterally into a new role, has a positive impact on an employee’s tenure with the company. It shows that you value them and reinforces that there is room for growth. This is critically important because one of the top-cited reasons why employees leave their job is the lack of opportunities to advance. This benefit is becoming more widely known as “internal hiring” and has increased 10% since 2015 . Employees are staying two times longer at companies with high internal mobility, and 51% of learning and development pros also see internal mobility as more of a priority now compared to pre-Covid-19. It’s also cheaper to find talent already in-house than to go recruiting. 9. 39% of workers would consider quitting if they had to work in the office full time Remote work may or may not be the new norm. The ruling is still out. Reports have shown that 35% of people were working from home in May 2020, but this was reduced by more than half in June this year to 14%. However, another survey shows that 39% of workers would consider quitting should there not be flexibility on work from home arrangements. As more people get used to working from home, returning to the office may seem like a hassle. Organizations will have to take this into consideration when planning working arrangements, and slowly easing employees back into the office may be one of the solutions. 10. 92% of companies use social media to look up candidates The majority of companies are casting their applicant nets by using the wide reach of social media . After all, candidates today spend a lot of time on various social platforms, so promoting jobs there increases the likelihood of qualified applicants seeing the job posting. Consider the use of platforms such as Twitter or even TikTok depending on the target profile of potential applicants. Social media profiles are also a way to screen candidates. In fact, 70% of recruiters check candidate profiles before extending an offer. Not sure how to use these statistics to your benefit? We're here to help. Schedule a call with us to find out how!

Amazon recently announced that they will be offering a starting pay of $18 an hour, and Chipotle has already raised their hourly pay to $15 an hour. While competitive compensation matters and may give candidates a reason to look your way, boosting wages alone isn’t enough to solve your hiring and retention challenges. Beyond competitive wages, your employees want a fun, supportive environment that highlights a clear path for progression. Wondering how to create that? Here are a few programs you should consider rolling out. Scholarships and Professional Development Today’s workforce is primarily made up of millennials and Gen Z, many of whom are actively enrolled in school or have aspirations to receive higher education. The cost of attending school leaves most with large amounts of debt. Lifting this financial burden (and its associated stresses) by providing tuition reimbursement or scholarships will help you attract—and keep—committed employees. This benefit is especially important for candidates from low-income backgrounds; a benefit like this—while it may seem like just tuition—is an open door to a world of opportunities. Take a page from Chick-fil-A ’s book. This year, the company will issue scholarships to more than 7,400 employees. Employees can receive up to $25,000 in scholarships and can apply those funds toward tuition at a college, university or technical school of their choice. Chipotle is also covering the full tuition fees for employees who choose to pursue college opportunities relevant to their area of work, such as agricultural science, hospitality and supply chain. This is a great way to help employees grow their careers with your company. Another way to help employees develop their careers with your company is through professional development. McDonald's , for example, provides career coaching, giving qualified employees the chance to learn from experts and influencers. Additionally, all employees are paired with free career and academic advising services. Time Off Today’s workforce wants to know their employers have their back, and it’s important for you to show them how you’ll support them through the ups of downs of (pandemic) life. Local businesses that employ hourly workers know that many of their employees are currently experiencing burnout from working understaffed shifts. Protect your employees by being more mindful of how you schedule their shifts, and encourage them to take time off—to preserve and care for their mental health and for fun. If you want to step up how you approach time off, consider giving all employees their birthday and work anniversaries off. And, for managers, go the extra mile. You can even introduce a performance-based incentive, like offering a travel stipend or concert tickets based on them meeting pre-determined goals. Employees also value time off to focus on family. Parental leave and short-term disability are important benefits that empower employees to attend to family needs without feeling like their job is at risk. Bonuses Employees want to be recognized for their contributions, and there are many ways you can meaningfully incentivize and reward them. Referral Bonuses Referral bonuses encourage employees to refer capable candidates and help you hire another qualified employee. Papa John’s offers referral bonuses of $50 for each new hire, with an additional $50 given to the new member. Performance Bonuses Performance bonuses motivate employees to meet company objectives. Chipotle , for example, rolled out a bonus plan allowing employees to earn up to an additional month's pay when they meet criteria, including sales, cashflows and throughput goals. Spot Bonuses Looking for a team that shows up to work on time, keeps energy high and is obsessed with the overall customer experience? Launch a spot bonus program to recognize their hard work as you see it happen. This can be in the form of movie tickets, iTunes gift cards or the like. Employee-Exclusive Discounts Your employees are working for a paycheck, so help them stretch their dollar. An alternative to giving them additional cash is providing them with exclusive employee discounts. This can be for child/elderly care, cell phone rates, theme park tickets and gym memberships. Financial Planning Applications Help your employees gain financial skills that set them up for long-term financial success. Give them access to classes or applications that will teach them how to better manage their money. KFC , for example, took a step towards this by launching a budgeting tool and giving employees access to financial coaches. Their aim is to help employees make better financial decisions. A Fun Work Environment Did you expect this to make the list? A fun work culture is important in keeping employees engaged and motivated at work. Bonding activities and events are a great way to help improve inclusivity and teamwork. If you offer all the perks under the sun but employees dread coming to work, you’re missing the mark. Employees spend a significant amount of time at work. Make it enjoyable. Shake Shack does this well by hosting a yearly company retreat coupled with leadership development classes and guest speakers, and employee appreciation days. What's Next? Local businesses are re-evaluating their employment packages—monetary and non-monetary benefits—and stepping up their game. They know that in order to win, their employees have to win too. It’s crucial for you to understand the needs of your employees , to effectively pivot the benefits offered, beyond wages. To get applicants in the door, you also need to make sure that your recruitment processes are convenient for candidates, and today, the best way to do that is with text-to-apply tools and automated interview scheduling .

Jack In The Box has been with Workstream for the past 4 months, and have posted 4 job posting since. They on-boarded Workstream for the two main values that were being offered, posting quality job posts and getting in candidates. My name is Philip Hsia (P) and my parents got into franchising Jack in the boxes in 1989 when they immigrated from Taipei, Taiwan. And they were looking for a better opportunity for our family. We have 7 locations, and we’ve been running the Jack in the boxes for about 30 years. In our industry, the turnover rate is 100% . So every year, we have a whole new crew. And so that was one of the biggest challenges I had to face. The problem that I encounter when I first joined my parents was hiring and bringing new people and new talent to our organization. The method that they were using was paper applications and referrals. Desmond Lim (D), Co-Founder of Workstream : I met Phillip who runs Jack In A Box about one year ago. He had a strong need for hiring. It was very challenging for him to hire hourly workers. He has 7 stores across Silicon Valley and our team is based right here too. Since we’ve been able to connect, we’ve been able to help him overcome his challenge for hiring hourly workers. P: Workstream has helped us in three different ways. One is the diversity of applicants . So we used to get paper only. Now applicants can text and submit online via phone . We’re actually getting a bunch of applicants we’ve never had before. The second is that they are an automation software . When I worked with Workstream to set it up, I had all the questions that I wanted to screen for applicants, and they would automatically put it in to their system. Every time a new applicant comes in, they get filtered through these questions before they reached our district manager. This saves our district managers a lot of time because the applicants that they see have already been pre-screened and filtered . The third thing which I found was actually my favorite, is working with the Customer Success Team. It actually releases a lot of time and stress from me. With the Customer Success, they are actually building the whole platform for us step-by-step. When we work together, I’m just basically there watching it all happen. From there, we need to just screen, interview and hire them. D: Over the past one year of working with Phillip and with Jack In A Box, it’s been a great joy to learn from them more about hiring too. They’ve been very forward thinking. And I hope to have the chance to work more with brands and these businesses similar to them. To be able to help them hire even better.

Yet, in just the 2 months that Chick-fil-A has been with Workstream , they have published 4 new positions and just within 7 days, they have seen 25 applicants while saving 50% of the time previously spent on hiring. Watch below to hear what Dusty Pyne (Franchise Owner of Chick-fil-A), Jason Gibbons (Talent Manager), and Rachel Hughes (HR Director) say about Workstream. Our founder Truett Cathy would always say that we are not in the restaurant business, we are in the people business. And so people are a really huge part of what we do. And people really do love Chick-fil-A. They love the nuggets, the sauce and all that. But the compliment we get the most is, you have great people. You can train anybody to push a button on a cash register, that’s not hard. You can’t train personality. Having people that we like to work with makes it a huge difference just in how we respond to people who come in and how we respond to each other as friends. Back in the day, it was all paper applications. You wanted a job, you go to where you want to work, you pick up the paper and that’s how you do it. Now at Workstream, it’s pretty streamlined. All the way from using an app, to screening an applicant, to paperwork where we can get it done overnight and hire an employee. And they just have to come in finish a couple of things. It doesn’t take that long at all. Not like it used to. The process of an application starts with an applicant sending in an application through whatever website they do, and it shows up to me through Workstream. And I check to see if that matches what we’re looking for so that I can set them up for an onsite interview which they can schedule themselves. My favorite part of Workstream I would have to say is the scheduling part. That makes me so happy. I don’t have to reach out and call every single person. And if they don’t answer then I’m just out of luck. I can take a look at my schedule during the day. If I have multiple interviews, it will show me. And if i don’t have anything, it just says, “relax, you’re done for the day”. And that makes me feel great. I’ve actually asked people how the process was leading up to the interview. They all said it was super easy. For the mobile app , I love how simple and efficient it is to have Workstream because I can just open it up and make it easy for myself and also for them.

Learn more about the hiring challenges he faced in the restaurant industry and how Workstream has helped him. Curry Up Now has been using Workstream for the past 6 months and has been able to find success in streamlining and improving the hiring and on-boarding process for their restaurants. My name is Amir Hosseini, I’m the co-founder of Curry Up Now. We started off as a food truck in 2009. We have 7 Bay Area locations and a pipeline of over 40 in construction. Hiring for us is a big challenge because we’re always looking to bring on the right people for our team. One thing that we learned very quickly is don’t make rush hires for the wrong reasons. You don’t always just want to fill in a role - you want to bring on people that can eat and breathe our mission, our value as an organization, rather than just filling in a shift. One of the biggest challenges we face in the restaurant industry is sourcing candidates and putting the right people in the right places . We’ve recently started using Workstream and this platform has truly helped us to transform the way we think about hiring and on-boarding our people. And one of the biggest and best features that I’ve found with the platform is using the text message feature to engage and interact with our applicants. It has been very successful in helping us close our no-show rates and getting people in the door. In the last 7 days, we’ve had over a hundred applicants use the Workstream platform and use the self-scheduling feature to book their own interviews. This helped us in both operations and in HR to save a ton of time . Workstream has allowed us to essentially put all of our candidates into one place and streamline the hiring process , whether it’s putting just a simple application in to scheduling an interview and finally on-boarding, it’s all there for us. We’ve tried a range of hiring softwares in the past but Workstream is easy to use and - design and UI has made it very easy for us to use . Using Workstream has had a significant impact on how we think about hiring and sourcing our candidates. It’s saved us a ton of time, a ton of money and we’re extremely happy that we decided to implement this platform into our operations.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, almost 11 million jobs remain unfilled. But it’s not that hourly workers resist working hard or solely focus on chasing that higher salary—they might just be feeling unfulfilled. The needs of the hourly workforce have been overlooked for too long. Feeling unappreciated, unseen, and uninspired, hourly workers (who comprise 80% of today's global workforce ) are doing something about it, as evidenced by the 150% turnover rate among the hourly workforce. Many feel forced to switch employers or industries to gain a sense of career growth. 80% of toady's global workforce is comprised of hourly workers 150% turnover rate among hourly workforce Rather than address this, many employers have started to view turnover as another cost of doing business. But with each new hire costing an average of $4,600 to acquire and onboard, this turnover is more than an inconvenience. It quickly becomes a financial strain that’s harmful to business. In a competitive job market, hourly employees can no longer be treated as a churn-and-burn commodity. The most obvious solution is this: employees will stick around if they feel supported and believe they can build a career with you. When we think of people as a future workforce pipeline rather than temporary workers, we create an employee experience that fosters growth and opportunity. In this guide, we’ll show you how you can become a best-in-class employer by fostering a work environment where hourly workers can grow—ultimately lowering turnover, encouraging loyalty, and creating staffing stability. Let’s look at the four workplace factors that help attract and retain hourly workers Career advancement A common misconception in the hourly workforce is that employees always chase money and will jump from employer to employer in pursuit of a higher wage. But according to the research shared in a BCG Deskless Worker Sentiment Survey , respondents valued opportunity over pay. Among hourly workers who said they might leave their jobs, 41% cited their employer’s lack of career advancement as the reason, versus 30% of respondents who mentioned pay. 41% of hourly workers would leave their jobs over lack of career advancement 30% would leave because of pay Career advancement isn’t just about getting job opportunities with more prestige or clout. It can also be the pursuit of a rewarding challenge, personal growth, or simply the need for change. If a job looks like a dead end, people seeking a sense of satisfaction from work will soon move on. Tip: Be clear about career advancement opportunities If employee retention is important to your business, demonstrate to your potential hire, as well as your existing workforce, how career growth is a viable (and highly visible) benefit. This means talking about career advancement as early as your job description. Go beyond simply saying there are opportunities for career advancement. Be explicit: Describe what future roles the job can grow into Let applicants know what skills they can acquire on the job Mention any training programs or certifications that come with the job According to a 2022 Great Attrition, Great Attraction 2.0 Global Survey by McKinsey , employees are no longer willing to stay in roles with no clear path for advancement: 41% said they quit their previous job for lack of career development/advancement and 31% for lack of meaningful work. 41% of workers quick their previous job due to lack of career advancement 30% quit due to lack of meaningful work Give people reasons to choose your job by showing opportunities it gives them. Because when you don't, your potential and current employees just might find new jobs that will. \"In a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.\" - Warren Buffet, business magnate, investor, and philanthropist Flexibility and autonomy Prompted by the mandated office closures of early 2020, business professionals started working remotely en masse. Even as the pandemic subsided, many businesses continued to offer their employees flexibility and autonomy over their work lives with the choice of remote or hybrid schedules. Simply because the hourly workforce often can’t work remotely doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t expect (or deserve) flexibility of their own. In fact, 47% of hourly workers would rather work for an organization that provides flexible scheduling and/or increased autonomy over one able to pay 10% more. 87% of employees now expect their employer to help them find a balance between their work and personal obligations. 47% of hourly workers value flexibility over pay 87% of workers expect employers to support work-life balance Tip: Give your employees a say in how they work In an employee-driven labor market defined by record-breaking turnover , most hourly workers realize that they make essential services possible. And they know they have options. Since working from home isn't a possibility for many hourly jobs, companies must come up with other ways to offer autonomy. Working how you want is often as important as working where you want. Demonstrate this by: Empowering hourly workers to make some decisions without your approval Rewarding teams when they improve existing processes or procedures Getting creative where you can with work scheduling and shift flexibility As a general rule, managers must deepen their understanding of what hourly workers actually need. Ask if they're enjoying enough independence on the job and which things they'd like to change. Embrace the idea that every employee is different and might have different approaches to work. Flexibility and autonomy in the workplace is based on the notion that you trust your hourly workers to get things done. And the more you trust your people, the more likely they'll feel engaged at work. \"Giving employees control over when, where, and how they work, is key to attracting and retaining talent.\" - Arvind Malhotra, future of work expert and UNC professor Skill development When comparing possible employers, job seekers look for positions that either match their experience and strengths, or offer the opportunity to build new skills. One Gallup survey found that jobs which offer skill development hold greater value to younger generations—with 87% of millennials citing development in a job as important. 87% of millenials want skill development on the job People don’t want to find themselves committed to a new job without a sense of connection to the work. Without alignment to their goals or current skills, they ultimately move on to something more fulfilling. Tip: Create a culture of learning If potential employees are looking for a career they can grow into, stand out from your competitors by: Creating training or skill development programs to empower hourly workers Encouraging your staff to try new things and build new skills on the job Offering rotations into different roles or the ability to job shadow others Doing so can help your organization find greater appeal among the career-minded applicants—the people who are able and willing to see the big picture. This is how you attract employees who are focused on how they can contribute to your success, not just how your job suits their needs. Candidates who prioritize skill alignment and development aren't just better employees. They're more engaged employees—which can mean they're 87% less likely to resign from their jobs. \"I am convinced that nothing we do is more important than hiring and developing people. At the end of the day, you bet on people, not on strategies.\" - Lawrence Bossidy, author and former business executive Good leadership The support, guidance, and leadership of a good manager makes a big difference—particularly for employees within the hourly workforce. This takes proven people skills, the ability to communicate effectively with hourly workers, and the confidence to provide constructive feedback. However, not all frontline leaders exhibit these attributes. Within many organizations, managers are almost entirely promoted from within without much guidance on how to transition from individual contributor to people leader. New frontline managers may quickly grasp new responsibilities around team scheduling and hitting quotas but don't know what it takes to support and grow their teams. Without the right training, frontline leaders are often ineffective at motivating their teams or giving them a structured work environment—two reasons why good people leave. Tip: Train your managers Help reassure job seekers and new hires that management has their best interests in mind. Provide on-site leadership training for managers at least once a year Tie managers' performance reviews to retention rates on their team's feedback Help managers build soft skills like empathy to improve relationships As you continue to train your managers in the fundamentals of people leadership, encourage them to foster a supportive work environment for their teams. Managers should conduct regular 1:1 conversations with everyone (not just for corrective action) and show them how to advance. Supportive managers also know how and when to recognize employee achievements—both big and small. When personal growth is encouraged, people feel more connected to the workplace. \"The single biggest way to impact an organization is to focus on leadership development. There is almost no limit to the potential of an organization that recruits good people, raises them up as leaders and continually develops them.\" - John Maxwell, best-selling author and leadership expert Show your employees you care, and they'll stick around Most hourly workers would prefer staying with the same employer rather than routinely changing jobs to gain career growth. Making the hourly workforce aware of the unique benefits you're already providing puts your organization at a greater advantage. In too many cases, applicants and current employees aren't aware of the great investments businesses are making to provide better work environments. Build great programs. Treat your team right. And shout it from the rooftops. Ready to hire hourly workers who are in it for the long haul?

These dedicated employees are the backbone of our economy, playing critical roles in industries like retail, hospitality, food and beverage, and manufacturing. Yet, when it comes to how they're hired, managed, and paid, employers aren't always equipped with the right technology to take care of their teams. 80% of the global workforce is comprised of hourly workers The challenge? Many businesses are still using the same standard solutions designed for office workers—tools that simply don't offer the flexibility, ease, and self-service options that an hourly workforce needs. Even more concerning is the fact that some businesses continue to rely on outdated paperwork and manual processes to manage their teams. What is an HR tech stack? To increase your operational efficiency, you need to build a collection of tools (or acquire an all-in-one solution) that helps you digitally manage HR tasks. An HR tech stack helps automate many of the tasks that were once performed manually by human resources teams—such as hiring, onboarding, shift scheduling, time clock management, payroll, and performance evaluation. When it comes to building the right HR tech stack for your business, it's all about prioritizing the features that will make the biggest impact. Start by considering how you currently handle everyday HR tasks, such as how people apply to your open roles or how you pay your hourly workers, and think about how new technology can enhance these processes. By investing in the right tools, you'll not only boost your productivity and save costs but also create a more empowering environment for your hourly workforce. Recruiting and hiring Among hourly workers with less than 12 months on the job, 52% are either actively or passively looking for a change . Making sure your recruiting and hiring process is quick, intuitive, and more accessible can better attract those job seekers. This is where an HR tech stack comes into play. 52% of hourly workers are looking for a job change The job search tactics of hourly workers can differ greatly from their white-collar counterparts. They’re less risk averse and willing to leave a job without having another one lined up. Working outside an office, they rely almost entirely on their phones as their main form of communication. With the right HR tech, your business can attract more applicants, perform background checks, streamline the orientation process, and get them all up to speed—ready to work from day one. When building your HR tech stack, include these tools to cover your hiring and recruiting needs: Applicant tracking systems (ATS) By offering unique ways to source applicants, an ATS is the backbone of your HR tech stack. It helps manage your overall recruiting and hiring process. Look for a platform like Workstream that can organize and screen job applications, allow applicants to schedule their own interviews, and send automated messages to applicants directly from the platform. Job posting platforms This type of HR tool helps simplify the process of posting your hourly positions to the job boards and sites you already use to recruit workers like Indeed, Monster, JobTarget, and ZipRecruiter. Background check services Whether part of an ATS or its own HR tool, this service allows you to check for criminal histories, driving records, and education/work histories of job seekers, coordinate drug screenings, and more. When integrated with your ATS, background check solutions like Checkr send background check requests automatically to applicants, moving them along in the hiring process if the results satisfy your specific requirements. Onboarding When you’re ready to turn an applicant into a new hire, onboarding and training tools are essential to providing a smooth experience from day one on. Modern onboarding tools will send offer letters to applicants via text, notify them when it’s time to complete their new hire paperwork, and make it easy to fill out forms and sign documents from their phones. Time and attendance Gone are the days of time clocks and handwritten schedules—today's hourly workplaces need modern solutions to keep up with the fast-paces demands. Time-tracking tools are no longer just a convenience; they're essential for creating order and ensuring smooth operations. For workers, a dependable time-tracking system offers peace of mind. They can easily confirm or request updates to their timesheet, ensuring their paychecks are accurate and that they're being fairly compensated for their time. It gives managers visibility into who's starting, ending, or covering shifts as planned, helping them keep the business appropriately staffed to meet demand, manage labor cost expectations, and run payroll accurately. For managers, reviewing, correcting, and approving timesheets can feel like a full-time job. It's time-consuming and can lead to errors that cost your business, especially when payroll mistakes or overtime issues arise. A reliable time-tracking system helps streamline this process, making it easier to spot and fix discrepancies before they become costly problems. Plus, it provides a clear and accurate record of breaks and overtime, helping you stay compliant with labor laws and avoid any legal headaches. Shift Scheduling No matter how good an organization or manager is at shift scheduling, it’s impossible to plan for all the unexpected situations or life events that get in the way. Employees get sick. Cars break down. Half your staff buys tickets to the same concert on the same night. When those little things prevent shifts from running smoothly, does your staff manager have to get involved to fill gaps in your schedule, or can hourly workers simply swap shifts among themselves? With the right tools in your HR tech stack, you can empower your hourly workers to swap shifts when it’s necessary, overcome scheduling conflicts, and help your business stay staffed without the stress. When setting up your HR tech stack, turn to app-based software for your shift scheduling needs: Time-tracking software Built with hourly work in mind, time-tracking software can automate all three components of time-tracking: time entry, approvals, and reporting. Instead of hourly workers manually clocking their time in and time out, it can be done electronically using software-based systems—providing convenience while also reducing inaccuracies. Besides timesheet approval and payroll processing, time tracking tools also help you better understand performance, labor cost budget, and compensation. Shift management tools Whether managing shifts at fixed locations or overseeing employees offsite, these types of software solutions enable everyone to stay current on shift details, schedule changes, and status updates. Hourly workers can swap shifts using an app, rather than having back-and-forth conversations via text messages or phone calls—all while managers still retain authority to approve or deny shift swaps. Scheduling tools For effective communication between workers at all levels at your workplace, it's critical to create and post schedules as far in advance as possible. Which is why any tech stack would benefit from the ability to inform employees about their shifts, let them confirm their availability, request time off, and let the managers adjust shifts accordingly. Payroll and benefits administration When it comes to your HR tech stack, payroll might just be the most important piece, especially if you're managing an hourly workforce. The complexities of hourly payroll—like fluctuating hours, different roles, various locations, and overtime—mean it's crucial to have a system designed to handle these challenges. Errors in payroll can be incredible costly, not just financially, but in terms of compliance and employee trust. For many hourly workers, payday is anything but predictable. They rarely get paid the same amount each time, thanks to the different hours they work, if they work different positions in the same pay period, how many locations they work at, and whether they've clocked in any overtime. This variability is the norm in hourly work, but it adds a layer of complexity to payroll that can't be ignored. Compliance is another critical factor. Making a mistake in how you handle lunch breaks, overtime, or tipping doesn't just lead to unhappy employees—it can lead to costly legal issues. Labor laws are strict, and staying on top of them is non-negotiable. Every aspect of payroll must align with these laws to avoid penalties and ensure your business is on the right side of the law. Correcting all this information every payroll run is not only time-consuming but also puts you at risk for errors, especially if you're copying and pasting data from one tool to another. That's why the most beneficial payroll solution for an hourly business is an all-in-one platform. A system that includes time tracking, shift scheduling, employee records, and more, all seamlessly integrated with payroll, helps you stay compliant, accurate, and efficient—every single payday. When selecting your HR tech stack, consider these tools for your payroll and benefits needs: Payroll software Too many hourly businesses either manage payroll by hand or use software designed to serve white collar workers with too many features they don't need and not enough of the ones they do. Look for software built for hourly that automatically flags errors, keeps your compliant, offers fast, expert support, and integrates seamlessly with your HR and time-tracking systems. Benefits enrollment and management platforms This HR technology can help a business maintain employee benefits enrollment, communication, and distribution for its hourly workforce. This is also where employees review, update, and utilize benefits or access forms and documents on a mobile device. Performance management Employee evaluations and performance management play important roles in achieving ongoing success in any workplace. But if you oversee an hourly workforce, you more than likely need a tool that is accessible on-the-go without the cluttered paper files or burdensome spreadsheets. Of course, workplace performance isn’t limited or measured by employee evaluations alone. It’s also about helping your people set goals and encouraging friendly competition to reach targets. Performance evaluation software These solutions incorporate brief questions to prompt action while keeping subjectivity or speculation to a minimum. They can provide managers with a foundation for coaching conversations, helping them better lead and grow their teams. The data you collect from this software can help inform your compensation, promotion, and succession planning decisions. And can even keep the lines of communication open via chat. Goal setting and tracking tools This HR technology is often used to inspire productivity, accelerate performance, and increase employee engagement through a combination of gamification, motivational psychology, and activity-based behaviors. Managers can set up personalized goals with metrics or implement leaderboards using progress bars and rankings to motivate teams. Employee experience In the aftermath of the Great Resignation, more businesses now recognize the value of retaining their best employees by prioritizing their professional needs, personal well being, flexible benefit options, and performance feedback. Those who don’t take care of their people risk losing them. Many among the hourly workforce feel unappreciated by their current employers. One recent survey revealed that 37% of frontline employees were considering leaving their jobs. Emotional issues like burnout were cited among the top factors negatively affecting employee experience. 37% of hourly workers are considering leaving their jobs When creating your HR tech stack, try these tools to address your employee experience needs: Communication tools Chat tools facilitate real-time communication, enabling quick responses to urgent needs and ensuring workers are informed and engaged no matter where they are. A mobile-first solution enhances real-time collaboration and ensures that important messages are delivered promptly, fostering a more efficient and cohesive work environment. Engagement survey tools Using a survey tool to collect feedback from hourly workers offers significant benefits for businesses. It allows you to continuously monitor employee satisfaction through various types of surveys, such as pulse, exit, and new hire surveys . This helps employers gather valuable insights into worker morale and engagement, ultimately reducing turnover and fostering a more positive work environment. Recognition platforms When a workforce feels both appreciated and valued, they tend to enjoy higher levels of job satisfaction. Businesses that encourage employee recognition experience reduced turnover rates and greater productivity. Recognition platforms allow workers and managers alike to recognize each other via eCards, award nominations, and other forms of positive reinforcement and company-wide acknowledgement—with any mobile device. This can include the celebration of employee birthdays as well as career anniversaries. 360 feedback systems These HR tools enable you to measure and track employee performance in key skills all through a mobile device. Managers can identify (and understand) skill gaps over time to improve team dynamics, better allocate training budgets, and adjust future hiring plans. These solutions give workers access to an open channel of communication to provide direct feedback to managers or further up the chain of command as needed. Compliance and reporting According to a study conducted at the height of the global pandemic, 65% of hourly workers say they hadn’t been provided with any additional technology to complete their jobs. An even greater number, 91%, said they wanted better training— which included safety and compliance. 65% of hourly workers don't have the tech they need to do their jobs 91% want better technology Failing to comply with company policies, procedures, and regulations could result in hefty fines for employees, owners, and businesses. But with a hourly workforce, ensuring that every employee is in compliance with the rules and requirements that govern your industry can prove challenging. Measuring, then analyzing, the productivity of your hourly workers can be just as difficult. It first starts with figuring out which specific things need to be measured. Different businesses can have different definitions of productivity. Should your KPI be the number of jobs completed in a given day, week, or month? Is response time in the field your metric? Is it customer satisfaction? Without the right tools, uncovering efficiencies to improve productivity in a timely manner can be a tedious process. Especially if your employees work independently or without direct oversight. There’s also a matter of separating actual work time from travel or administrative tasks. Some of your KPIs can be measured independently. Other KPIs require self reporting or customer input. When selecting your HR tech stack, try these tools for your compliance and reporting needs: Compliance management software This type of HR technology stores all your compliance-related information in one central location, accessible to your employees on their mobile devices—keeping them informed on current company policies and procedures. Real-time notifications about activity status (such as incomplete or delayed tasks) remind and encourage users to get in compliance. Look for solutions that integrate training directly in the tools that your workers already use. Reporting and analytics tools This software incorporates streamlined workflows and modern technologies to schedule, track, monitor, and analyze the performance of shift workers on their mobile devices as they conduct work activities—giving you a clear, real-time view of day-to-day operations. This can take the form of customized mobile timesheets, work-related app- or site-usage monitoring, GPS tracking, or daily check-in prompts, often compiled into a visual timeline. Learning management system Traditional training platforms for the workplace are designed for office-bound or centrally located employees. The needs of the hourly workforce are obviously different. On the road or on the job, hourly workers are always on the move. Pulling them off the frontline to train in a classroom or behind a desk is costly and impractical. Yet, your workers crave more education (as evidenced in the previous section by their desire for career advancement). Or need corporate or compliance-based training. With hourly workers, employers and HR managers must find ways to offer training that can be completed anywhere —with all the information they need—without slowing them down at work. When setting up your HR tech stack, use app-based tools for your learning management needs: Digital training tools/programs Look for tools that break up training in short, to-the-point units instead of hour-plus presentations. When critical or time-sensitive information becomes available, some software solutions can send notifications via text to every employee’s mobile device for added efficiency, rather than waiting until everyone is in the same room to get up-to-date about courses. How you build your tech stack matters 52% of hourly workers claim they would leave their jobs over tech tools. They expect and deserve the same quality experience with HR technology as their white-collar counterparts. 52% of hourly workers would leave their jobs over tech tools Putting together a solid HR tech stack for an hourly workforce takes time, effort, and research. But it doesn’t have to happen all at once. Whether it’s the lack of mobile-friendly payroll options for your employees, the need for flexible and accessible shift scheduling, or a gap in compliance training, identify and focus on which HR tools fit your biggest priorities. Know that once the implementation is complete, it will be rewarding and well worth the effort for many reasons. Your HR tech stack can help improve the worker experience, increase overall job satisfaction, and decrease turnover rates—making it that much easier to manage your business.

However, asking interviewees routine, out-of-the-box questions can sometimes become repetitive and mundane. On top of that, the run-of-the-mill questions may not create an opportunity for you to see the most authentic side of your candidates. Instead, you’re more likely to get responses they planned and prepared to share. Unique interview questions, on the other hand, can take your candidates by surprise—in a good way. Creative interview questions provide an opportunity for you to show your candidates the fun side of your culture and enable you to bring out your candidates’ true selves, giving you a chance to understand their personalities and thought patterns. If you’re looking to add variety to your interviews, consider adding a question from our round-up of the top 10 most unique interview questions. 1. If you were a dessert, what dessert would you be? 2. Yellow is over here; blue is over there. Where are you? 3. If you were to take over as CEO of your current company tomorrow and had to increase your company’s current growth rate, what three areas would you invest in? 4. Why shouldn’t we hire you? 5. How would you solve problems if you were from Mars? 6. You’ve been given an elephant. You can’t give it away or sell it. What would you do with it? 7. How much would you charge to wash every window in Seattle? 8. If you had a choice between two superpowers, invisibility or flying, which would you choose and why? 9. If you could compare yourself to any animal, which would it be and why? 10. How many footballs would fit into this room? With these unique interview questions, you can assess whether an individual is indeed a good fit for your company. So, let’s get started! Top 10 unique interview questions to ask If you were a dessert, what dessert would you be? This question may sound absurd, but it will give insights into how the candidates see themselves and their ability to think creatively. It also assesses their capability to hold a conversation, which is important for customer-facing roles because it allows them to give customers a better experience when taking their orders. What to look out for in candidates’ responses: There’s no right answer to this question. Instead, look for candidates who can link their answers to something positive about themselves. A good answer will also include detailed reasoning behind their choice. Yellow is over here; blue is over there. Where are you? This question might seem irrelevant at first glance. However, it can show how your candidates handle open-ended thinking and their reactions when faced with uncertain situations. What to look out for in candidates’ responses: Look for candidates who can maintain their composure when asked this question. Focus on how they articulate their thoughts, as this showcases their reasoning skills. A solid candidate will be able to link the reason behind their answer. If you were to take over as CEO of your current company tomorrow and had to increase your company’s current growth rate, what three areas would you invest in? A favorite among hiring managers, this type of question allows your candidates to show their strengths and strategic-thinking skills and gives you a chance to see if they're a good fit for the hourly job position. What to look out for in candidates’ responses: A good answer will not only include plausible strategies, but it will also showcase their empathy. As the candidate gets into their hypothetical actions as a CEO, see if they acknowledge how their actions may affect the team. This is a great way to spot a team player. This is especially important in the QSR industry where most job responsibilities require teamwork of some sort. Why shouldn’t we hire you? Our fourth question is a fresh take on the common ‘What do you think are your areas of improvement?’ interview question. It allows interviewees the chance to either highlight the skills they're lacking or why they might not be the perfect candidate you’re looking for. What to look out for in candidates’ responses: Look out for responses that reflect behavior accepted by your team. For example, if you’re interviewing candidates for a cashier position and are willing to allow them to change their shifts around, a response like “I’m currently a student, so I need flexibility with my shifts. If the shifts aren’t flexible, you shouldn’t hire me” could be just fine. How would you solve problems if you were from Mars? Frequently asked by Amazon, this question helps you assess if your candidates can think outside of the box when presented with an unusual situation. It allows you to see if they can adapt to a new work environment. What to look out for in candidates’ responses: A good response will demonstrate the ability to solve problems by evaluating the situation fairly before coming up with solutions. One way is to acknowledge the different issues that are present on Mars, which may call for a different type of solution than those on Earth. It will be best if the candidate can come up with a general framework to solve the problem, such as finding the cause and effect of the issue before taking any action. You’ve been given an elephant. You can’t give it away or sell it. What would you do with it? This undoubtedly sounds like an improbable situation, but the candidate's response could give you a better sense of their reasoning skills and how they think, prioritize, and solve problems. What’s more, asking this will loosen the candidate up, allowing you to get to know their genuine side better and faster. What to look out for in candidates’ responses: Look for a structured response that tells you the reasoning behind their answer. A solid candidate can convince you their action is justifiable because it shows they can quickly make logical and sound arguments. How much do you charge to wash every window in Seattle? This particular question is an effective one to ascertain how well your candidate can problem-solve. In a customer-facing role, thinking and solving problems quickly is so important. What to look out for in candidates’ responses: With this question, look for someone who can apply logical problem-solving skills. For example, they can list the relevant factors such as energy exerted and time required to clean a window and whether the profits at the end reflect their efforts. A solid candidate will also be able to remain calm when asked this unexpected question. If you had a choice between two superpowers, invisibility or flying, which would you choose and why? While this question may sound like a childish one, it can be an indicator of potential leadership capabilities. Getting a better sense of how they would use their superpower could show that they use it for their own benefit—or for the benefit of others. What to look out for in candidates’ responses: The ideal response to this question depends on the job position you are hiring for. Does the position require the employee to hold some sort of leadership position? If it does, you would want to look out for those who clearly communicate how they would use their superpower to help others, although not necessarily exclusively. If you could compare yourself to any animal, which would it be and why? This question allows you to evaluate a candidate’s innovativeness, creativity, and quick-thinking skills. It also provides them with an opportunity to highlight their best qualities. What to look out for in candidates’ responses: An ideal answer will preferably focus on strengths that are valued by your company. For example, a candidate may say they would be a horse so they can function independently and in a team, on top of being fast learners. How many footballs would fit into this room? Similar to question 7, this question assesses a candidate’s logical reasoning skills. It’s a good brain teaser to see how an interviewee can use logic to figure out seemingly illogical challenges. What to look out for in candidates’ responses: A good candidate will be able to walk you through their solution using logical methods. For example, they may measure the size of the football and room and use math to answer the question. An even better situation: the candidate asks questions to clarify certain aspects of the question, such as whether the furniture will remain in the room, for example. This shows that the candidate prefers asking second-level questions before coming up with solutions to a problem. Creative interview questions such as the ones above will give you a different perspective when assessing your candidates. It’s important to note that for these unique interview questions, you’re not necessarily looking for a “right” answer. Instead, focus on the way interviewees articulate their thoughts when coming up with their responses. It’s also important to draw a line between unique questions and inappropriate questions .

Share this article Time to hire . Two words, one concept, immense impact on your business success. A day more could mean losing out on top talent ; a day less might risk skipping essential screening steps leading to an unfit recruit. This post will help turn those days into hours by identifying bottlenecks in recruitment processes and streamlining them effectively for faster checkmates . You'll also gain insights into key recruitment metrics to track progress and best practices for efficient hiring from real-life case studies. Understanding Time to Hire The time to hire , as its name suggests, measures the time it takes from when a candidate applies for a job until they accept an offer. This metric is more than just counting days on your calendar; it's about gauging the efficiency of your recruiting process and assessing candidate experience . In essence, the quicker you can get qualified candidates through your recruitment funnel, the better. But why does this matter? Competition and cost are the two primary reasons why quick recruitment of qualified candidates is essential. The longer a job opening stays vacant, the more opportunities top talents have to explore other options—this could mean losing them to competitors or spending extra resources in keeping them engaged. On average, time-to-hire spans between 24-30 days depending upon industry norms and specific roles. Of course, many factors come into play here such as hiring team ’s efficiency or even external factors that might delay things unexpectedly. This is where our focus needs to be sharp - understanding these intricacies gives us not only insight but also control over our own hiring success. With careful tracking of each stage in your recruiting process —from receiving applications up till finalizing job offer acceptance—you're able develop strategies that streamline procedures leading towards efficient human resource management. An optimized time-to-hire indicates effective talent acquisition practices at work—and who doesn't want that? Factors Affecting Time to Hire The journey from job requisition to a candidate accepting a job offer can be influenced by several factors. It's like preparing for a marathon; you have your goal in sight, but numerous obstacles and conditions along the way will affect your finish time. Internal Factors: Your hiring team plays an instrumental role. The speed of their review process when candidates apply or the efficiency with which they conduct interviews can significantly impact time-to-hire metrics . Just as an efficient pit crew speeds up race times, so does an effective recruiting team accelerate the hiring process . A streamlined recruitment funnel is crucial here - imagine it like having clear lanes on our marathon track. External Factors: The number of qualified candidates available: Like having more runners in our marathon may lead to longer finishing times if not managed well. The attractiveness of the job offer : If we're running towards something exciting at the end line, wouldn't we run faster? Candidate experience during interview processes impacts how quickly they decide whether or not this race is worth completing. To shed some light on this topic let’s look at key stats: while Glassdoor research suggests that average ' time to fill ' globally stands around 36 days (that's quite long.), companies usually achieve ' time to hire ' between 24-30 days. Understanding these factors can help identify potential roadblocks in your hiring journey, and remember, a smooth marathon track always leads to better race times. Improving Time To Hire Hiring the right talent is a race against time. A drawn-out hiring process can lead to losing qualified candidates , impacting business productivity and increasing costs. But don't worry. There are effective ways to speed up your recruitment funnel. Optimize Your Recruitment Funnel: An optimized recruitment funnel makes it easy for suitable candidates to apply and progress through the stages quickly. Get rid of unnecessary bottlenecks that slow down the process like redundant interviews or long-winded application forms. Leverage Technology: The use of an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) has been proven as a game-changer in improving time-to-hire . An effective ATS can automate repetitive tasks, making your recruiting team more efficient by freeing them from administrative duties. Engage Candidates Early On Candidate engagement starts when they first come across your job requisition and continues until they accept your job offer —or not. If you engage with potential hires early on, chances are high they will stick around even if external factors delay their journey into becoming part of your company's fabric. Simplify Screening Processes A complex screening process might be doing more harm than good by deterring quality applicants away from applying at all or slowing down those who do manage to apply. Streamlining these processes helps reduce time spent on unqualified applicants while speeding up responses for those who pass muster. Key Stats: Did you know there are five effective ways we've found help companies improve their time-to-hire ? It's true - each one involves keeping track of different stages in the recruiting funnel. Measuring And Tracking Time To Hire The first step in making sure your hiring process is efficient is to measure time . But what exactly does ' time to hire ' mean? It's the number of days between a candidate applying for a job and accepting the job offer . This metric, used by half of all companies according to our recruitment metrics report, helps gauge recruiting efficiency. A shorter time span indicates an efficient recruitment process . Yet, it doesn't always guarantee quality hires. That’s where another crucial element comes into play - tracking each stage of your recruiting team 's progress with respect to each job requisition . Your starting point should be defining clear goals or benchmarks based on past data and industry standards. It's reported that half of all businesses utilize this approach. By doing so, you can easily spot any potential delays or bottlenecks at different stages in the hiring pipeline. Analyzing The Data For Improvement You've gathered some pretty useful data here; now let's put it into action. Analyze these numbers carefully using recruiting analytics tools and software like an applicant tracking system (ATS). Not only will they help keep track but also suggest areas for improvement by highlighting inefficient processes in your recruitment funnel. Workable’s guide on Time-To-Hire Metrics provides excellent insights on how measuring this critical factor allows businesses not just meet their hiring needs faster but also ensure high-quality talent acquisition as well. Best Practices For Efficient Hiring But, it's not just about filling that job opening ; it’s also about ensuring an efficient recruitment process . Here are some best practices to make your hiring more effective and quicker. A Streamlined Recruitment Process The first step in achieving efficiency in hiring is by having a clear understanding of your talent acquisition needs. This includes accurately defining job requisitions and creating precise candidate profiles. This clarity can significantly reduce time spent on sorting through unsuitable candidates and increase chances of attracting good ones who meet the criteria set out for each position. It'll give you a better starting point when assessing applications as they come in. Strong Employer Branding And Talent Pool Management In today's competitive market, establishing a strong employer brand can be instrumental in reducing the average time-to-fill roles. A positive reputation helps attract qualified candidates even before there's an actual need or vacancy – effectively creating a pool of ready applicants to tap into once openings arise. Promoting Open Communication Fostering open communication with potential hires goes beyond making them feel valued - it makes sure their expectations align with what you offer as well. When the hiring manager clearly communicates role requirements, responsibilities, company culture, and growth opportunities from day one – both parties get to avoid any unpleasant surprises later on. Stats show that measuring time to hire helps identify weak spots in the recruitment process (source: Workable). So, it's clear - having a robust hiring process not only helps fill job openings faster but also contributes to improved retention rates. And who doesn't want that? Case Studies On Successful Time To Hire Strategies Hiring strategies are a crucial aspect of business planning. We often view time to hire as an efficiency metric, but it tells us more than just how long we spent in the recruitment process . It's also about offer acceptance and finding quality candidates. Glassdoor reports that the average time to hire ranges between 20 and 30 days, with significant variations across different industries. This gives us a starting point for analyzing successful hiring practices. The Power of Effective Hiring: Company A Company A is renowned for its effective hiring processes . The team reduced their long time-to-fill by implementing clear job requisitions early on, thus ensuring only suitable candidates applied. This strategy not only improved their overall recruiting efficiency but also led to quicker job offer acceptance from applicants due to transparent expectations from the get-go. Leveraging Technology: Company B Another interesting case study is Company B which utilized modern technology tools like applicant tracking systems (ATS). This helped them streamline their recruitment funnel by identifying unnecessary bottlenecks where good candidates were getting stuck or lost. As a result, they experienced higher candidate engagement leading towards faster hires within few days' time. A People-Centric Approach: Company C Last but certainly not least is company C who prioritized human resource management over strict metrics-led approaches in talent acquisition . Their success story lies in focusing on individual potential rather than strict job requirements. They found that this led to candidates accepting job offers more quickly and becoming valuable team members in a shorter span of time, thereby reducing their average hire = day metric significantly. FAQs in Relation to Time to Hire What is the formula for time to hire ? The time to hire equation is pretty straightforward. It's simply the date a candidate accepts an offer minus the day they applied. What is time to hire vs time to fill ? ' Time to Hire ' starts when someone applies and ends when they accept your job offer . ' Time to Fill ', though, starts with posting a job and finishes once it's filled. What is typical time-to-hire ? Average Time-to-Hire usually falls between 24-30 days. However, this varies based on factors like industry type or role complexity. What impacts time-to-hire ? Different elements influence Time-To-Hire : company size, job level, recruitment process efficiency - even external factors such as market competition can play a part. Conclusion Time to hire . A simple concept with a significant impact on your hiring success. You've learned the importance of this crucial metric, and how it shapes your recruiting efficiency and candidate experience . Remember, speed is essential but not at the cost of quality hires. Identifying bottlenecks in your recruitment process can be transformative. You're now equipped to recognize these pain points, use relevant metrics for tracking progress, and apply effective strategies for improvement. Your game-changer? Leveraging technology like applicant tracking systems (ATS) to streamline screening processes. Couple that with strategic business planning and strong employer branding - you're well on your way to reduce time-to-hire effectively!

This is the main landing page where all open career opportunities and job descriptions are listed, and where most (if not all) job applications will go through. Think of all the different ways you can promote your open positions from social media advertising to the use of job boards, Text-to-Apply posters , and headhunters. All of these tactics depend on a successfully integrated and informative career page. And once a prospective candidate lands on your page, the content and experience you display are what will drive them to either click \"apply now,\" or bounce to your competitor's website. Importance of having a career page A career page is important in many ways. While it simplifies the hiring process, it's also crucial in reducing the time and cost of hiring, which helps grow your brand and business. How is this possible? By consolidating all available job listings in one area, your HR team doesn't have to go through applications across different job boards, which reduces the time available for screening candidates. Additionally, they can easily reroute applicants to the career page, should they have questions on how to best apply for jobs. Cost savings occur as consultancy firms are no longer necessary, and a database of attractive and high-profile CVs are also being stored for future use. With an increase in open job postings, your clients will also realize your company is growing significantly, which builds trust and increases business opportunities . Furthermore, qualified candidates are also more likely to click on the career page and apply when they visit your website in search of career opportunities, allowing you to build a diverse and skilled team while reducing turnover rates . Features the best career pages have Large-scale quick-service restaurants (QSRs) such as Chick-fil-A, Jamba, and Cinnabon leverage Workstream to customize and create the best career pages, which have proven to be successful. Here are some unique features that will be useful in building your career page: Customization and location-based features By incorporating a customized background and location-based features, Jamba is able to automatically send 28,000 text messages via Workstream, successfully sourcing over 18,000 applicants in 2019. This effectively saves over 10.3 hours per week per location! Cinnabon's career page allows applicants to search for job titles by location while indicating the distance between the candidate and the job location. It's especially important for applicants looking for work locations within commuting or walking distance from their homes. Smart screening Workstream also allows for customization in terms of questions asked on the careers page. These could include \"do you have reliable transportation?\" or \"are you able to work x hours of shifts on these days?\" It even allows candidates to upload a 30-second introduction video which helps them showcase their personality. Smart screening questions help in filtering (and automatically rejecting) candidates who may not fit certain crucial requirements for the job, which in turn saves time for the hiring team. Integrated job boards All applications are funneled into a central depository where hiring managers can view and manage them without having to log into multiple platforms across different job boards. They are also in touch throughout every stage of the process and can leave comments or feedback on each candidate. Automation is utilized across every stage of the hiring process, allowing hiring managers to set automation rules to determine if rejections or reminders are sent out to candidates. Automated scheduling and text reminders Another common pain point experienced by hiring managers is having to schedule interviews with candidates. It's never easy to find a common time, especially if multiple parties are involved in the interview. However, Workstream allows hiring managers to sync their work calendars on the Workstream platform, thereby allowing candidates to choose a time based on the availability of both parties. Automatic text reminders are also sent prior to the scheduled interview, which reduces ghosting and no-shows. Applicants may also choose to reschedule their interview through text messaging. Tips for building the best career pages Now that you know what features the best career pages have, it's time to build your own. Read on to find some examples of the best career pages powered by Workstream. Optimization (SEO and Mobile) Search Engine Optimization ensures that your career page appears organically on the Google search results page (which may help in reducing spending on Google Ads), and candidates are more likely to chance upon your career page on your website while surfing the internet. This means that job titles, descriptions, and even the company introduction should contain keywords that are high volume search terms, whenever possible. The key is to find the right balance between optimizing the page and having relevant content available for applicants. Do not forget mobile optimization , which is equally crucial as more people are applying with their mobile phones rather than on a desktop, and you don't want applicants clicking out of your page too quickly due to a messy layout. Workstream automatically ensures that all the best career pages are mobile-optimized, so that is one less thing to worry about. Storytelling The best way to engage potential candidates is through storytelling . From your brand origin to the introduction of the company and job description, having a fun and creative story sets you apart from your competitors. Clearly segmented headers, sections, and subsections in Workstream promote storytelling and unique copywriting across the best career pages. Mooyah crafts exciting brand summaries and job descriptions that are unique to each job posting. This increases the likelihood of candidates wanting to apply for the job. The storytelling element can be further improved with employer brand videos highlighting company-wide bonding activities, b-roll of staff chatting or enjoying their break time in the office compounds, and even an office tour! These are some simple, yet interesting ways to showcase the company's culture and environment which can be effective in inviting new blood to the team. Make it convenient for applicants As mentioned before, location is an important factor for most candidates. Make it simple for candidates to locate the office premises by pinpointing the location on the map relative to their current location, or listing down the distance in miles. This saves candidates some time cross-checking against Google Maps in a separate tab, and they may be more willing to apply for a job opportunity in locations nearby. Workstream's location features allow for the above to take place, simplifying the process and providing convenience to candidates. Let Workstream help you Still not convinced? Workstream has a built-in smart sponsorship system , which allows you to optimize your job postings across multiple job boards and social media sites and access a greater talent pool. The streamlined system also ensures that everything can be done within one platform, providing convenience to hiring managers. Workstream also makes it easy to send training videos, slides, and quizzes, which is especially crucial for getting employees up to speed on your company policies and procedures before they start on day one. Applicants can access the materials anytime via their smartphones. Furthermore, contactless hiring allows hiring managers to screen candidates via video resumes rather than through face-to-face interviews. SMS reminders are also sent to applicants to guarantee completion of any training courses and can be sent to both new hires and existing employees. The best careers sites will attract quality candidates for your company, which will in turn help to improve client relationships, save time and cost, and ultimately grow your business. Workstream has a myriad of features for you to build the best careers pages, which can be your next step in securing a greater applicant pool. Schedule a demo today to find out more.

The very word can strike fear into the heart of even the most experienced job seekers and recruiters . It’s a hurdle that must be overcome to achieve success in the modern workforce. One that requires the right blend of knowledge, expertise, and confidence to ace. Employers want to know that you understand the purpose of interviewing and how to prepare for it. Employees, on the other hand, want to feel confident that they can win over their potential employers by showing off their interviewing skills and gaining a job offer . Whether you’re a job seeker , recruiter , or journalist, mastering the art of interviewing is essential to succeed in the modern world. Here, we provide expert tips and techniques to help you understand effective interviewing strategies, question formulation, and more — so you can take your interview skills to the next level. What is considered interviewing? Before we dive into the nitty-gritty details, let’s define what exactly is referred to as interviewing. Interviewing is a process of obtaining information from one or more sources through questioning and observation. It’s an exchange of ideas and knowledge between two or more people, and can be conducted in a range of settings — from face-to-face meetings to virtual video conferences. The candidate or source of information is typically expected to answer questions that are related to the topic or job at hand, while the interviewer will assess the responses and use them to determine if the candidate is suitable for the role. What is the main purpose of interviewing? The purpose of interviewing is twofold — it enables you to find out more about the candidate, and it provides the candidate with an opportunity to learn more about the job. For employers, interviewing is used as a tool to assess how suitable a candidate is for a particular role. They can use their time with the candidate to understand more about their skills and experience, as well as to determine how well the two parties would be able to work together. Conversely, the interview process can be advantageous to job seekers , who have the opportunity to learn more about their desired organization and consider what role they could play in it. This experience allows them to get a better understanding of how their abilities and expertise would help advance the company’s mission. Is a phone screen an interview? Although often referred to as a phone interview , a phone screen is not an official interview. The phone screen phase of the recruitment process is usually used to assess a candidate’s suitability before they are invited for an in-person or virtual interview. The interviewer will typically ask questions about the applicant’s experience, skills, and qualifications in reference to the type of job on offer — all of which can be answered quickly over the phone. This can include questions such as “why are you interested in this job?” and “what experience do you have that ensures you are suitable for the role?”. A phone screen should not be considered an interview in itself — it is merely a first step towards an actual interview. While you are interviewing your candidate, you should still remain professional and courteous throughout the conversation. Likewise, the candidate should remember to keep their answers succinct and to the point. What are the 3 C’s of interviewing? In the world of job interviews , the 3 C’s are often cited as the key factors that employers consider when evaluating candidates. These 3 C’s are Competence, Character, and Chemistry . Each of these factors plays an important role in the hiring process , and understanding them can help job seekers prepare for interviews and increase their odds of landing the job they want. Competence Competence refers to the candidate’s technical skills and knowledge of the job. Employers need to know that the applicant is qualified for the position and can handle any challenges they may face. Therefore, job seekers should ensure that their resumes, portfolios, and cover letters accurately reflect their experience and qualifications. Demonstrating competence during the interview process can give candidates a significant advantage over their competition. It’s crucial for job seekers to be confident in their abilities and provide concrete examples of their past accomplishments that highlight their technical proficiency. Employers appreciate candidates who can showcase their skills and offer innovative solutions to complex problems. In addition to technical competence, soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability are also essential for success in any job. Candidates who can demonstrate a strong work ethic, an optimistic attitude, and a willingness to learn and grow are highly sought after in today’s job market. As part of the assessment, employers may also ask questions regarding the candidate’s prior work history or experience related to the job. This allows them to gauge how well they have managed similar scenarios in the past and if they are adequately prepared for any obstacles that could occur during their new role. Character Character refers to the candidate’s personal qualities, such as their values, work ethic, and attitude. Employers want to hire candidates who are trustworthy, dependable, and have a positive attitude. Their character says a lot about them, and it’s important to demonstrate during the job interview that they have the qualities employers are looking for. During the interview, employers may ask questions related to the candidate’s work style, problem-solving abilities, and decision-making processes to determine whether they align with the company’s values and culture. When this happens, it’s important for candidates to be honest and authentic in their responses and to provide examples of how they have demonstrated these qualities in their previous work experiences. Some good examples of character-related questions an employer can ask include: How do you handle stress and difficult situations? What have been your biggest challenges at work, and how did you overcome them? Describe a moment when you had to make an unpopular decision. Correspondingly, good responses from the candidate may look a little something like this: I am able to remain calm under pressure and think clearly in difficult situations. For example, last year, when our company was facing a tight deadline, I was able to stay focused and coordinate with my team to ensure that the project was delivered on time. One of my biggest professional challenges has been learning how to delegate tasks effectively. To help me develop this skill, I took a course in leadership and management, which gave me the tools I needed to build successful teams. When I had to make an unpopular decision, my priority was always to ensure it was in the company’s best interest. In one situation, I had to let go of a team member who was not meeting expectations, even though I knew it would be a difficult conversation. Chemistry Chemistry refers to the candidate’s rapport and compatibility with the interviewer and the team. Employers want to hire candidates who will work well with others and who will contribute positively to the workplace. Having good chemistry with a team can be just as important as having the technical skills to perform the job. Employers understand that hiring someone who doesn’t fit in with the team can create a negative work environment and ultimately impact productivity. During the interview process , job seekers should pay close attention to the company culture and the people they interact with. Being respectful, professional, and approachable is essential, as this can help build rapport with the interviewer and demonstrate the ability to work well with others. Beyond the interview, chemistry can continue to play a significant role in the workplace. Collaboration and teamwork are critical components of most jobs, and having positive chemistry with colleagues can lead to more effective communication, greater trust, and improved productivity. At the same time, it’s essential to recognize that not everyone will have perfect chemistry with every person they work with. Different personalities, backgrounds, and communication styles can create challenges in any workplace. However, being aware of these differences and making an effort to work through them can help build stronger relationships and contribute to a more positive work environment. What are 5 keys to interviewing? | Tips for interviewers The 3 C’s may be a solid framework for conducting successful interviews , but those looking for top-of-the-line candidates know that it takes more than just the basics. Here are 5 keys to interviewing that will yield the perfect candidate for your organization. 1. Prepare like a pro A successful interview starts with thorough preparation. Before the interview, take time to review the candidate’s application materials, including their resume and cover letter. Research their background and experience, and identify specific questions to ask that will help you assess their qualifications for the position. The more you know about the candidate, the more informed your decisions will be. 2. Create a comfortable atmosphere Interviews can be nerve-wracking for candidates, so it’s important to create a comfortable atmosphere. Start by greeting the candidate warmly and engaging in small talk to help them feel at ease. Ask them about their journey to the interview, and make sure that they have access to snacks and drinks if needed. During the interview, keep a positive attitude and remember that your goal is to learn more about the candidate and their skillset, not necessarily to weed people out. By creating a relaxed and welcoming environment, you can help the candidate showcase their true abilities. That’s really what interviewing is all about. 3. Ask open-ended questions Some of the best questions to ask when interviewing someone are open-ended questions. These questions encourage the candidate to share their experiences and insights. This will help you better assess their abilities and determine if they’re a good fit for the position. Dodge closed-ended questions that can be responded to with a simple “yes” or “no,” as these won’t provide the depth of information you need. Instead, you can use probing questions and hypotheticals to draw out the candidate’s knowledge and capabilities. Here are a set of questions to get you started: How do you keep track of new trends and advancements in your industry? What attribute do you believe sets you apart from the crowd, and how have you leveraged it in prior positions? Can you walk me through a project you managed from start to finish, and how you approached any obstacles that arose? How do you prioritize your workload when faced with multiple competing deadlines? Describe a situation where you had to work with an uncooperative stakeholder or colleague, and how did you manage it? What motivates you to do your best work? (Check out our piece on motivational interviewing techniques ). How do you handle constructive criticism or feedback? Tell me about a difficult decision you had to make and what process did you go through in order to come up with the right choice? What skills or expertise do you bring to this position that sets you apart from other candidates? As the candidate answers your questions, focus on their body language and listen intently. It’s important to pay attention to more than just the words they say — their attitude, demeanor, and nonverbal cues can give you insight into their aptitude for the job. 4. Listen more than you talk Active listening is a crucial skill for everyone in the modern workspace, but it’s especially important when interviewing. As the interviewer, it’s your responsibility to allow the candidate to provide answers in full without interruption. Focus on their words and ask follow-up questions if needed, but don’t take over the conversation or dominate the room. Instead, encourage them to speak freely about their experiences, and gauge their enthusiasm for the position. The more you listen, the more information you’ll gain about their skills and qualifications, which will help you make a better decision in the end. Take notes during the interview to help you remember important details and to show the candidate that you’re engaged in the conversation. By actively listening, you can make more informed hiring decisions, ultimately leading to a successful and fulfilling partnership between your organization and the candidate. 5. Follow up promptly After the interview, it’s essential to follow up with the candidate promptly. Let them know what to expect next in the hiring process , and provide a timeline for when they can hope to hear back from you. You will need to have the best times for interviews ready as well in case you want to immediately schedule another one. If you decide not to move forward with the candidate, let them know as soon as possible. Providing timely feedback shows respect for the candidate’s time and helps build a positive reputation for your organization. What are 5 keys to interviewing? | Tips for interviewees Interviewers may have their own set of rules, but there are also a few key tips that job seekers should keep in mind when preparing for an interview. Here are 5 keys to interviewing that applicants should consider. 1. Research thoroughly If you want to nail your interview, you need to do your homework. This means researching the company, the position you’re interviewing for, and the person or people you’ll be speaking with. Start by combing through the company’s website and social media accounts, paying close attention to their mission statement, values, and recent projects. Check out the LinkedIn profiles of your interviewers, and look for commonalities between their backgrounds and your own. The more you know about the company and your interviewers, the better you’ll be able to tailor your responses and questions to their needs and interests. This can help you stand out from other candidates and demonstrate your enthusiasm and dedication to the job. Plus, it shows that you’re willing to go the extra mile to prepare for an interview, which is always impressive to hiring managers . So don’t skimp on the research - it could be the key to scoring your dream job. 2. Practice your responses The second key to acing your interview is practicing your responses to common interview questions (these can include restaurant interview questions ) . Doing so lets you prepare thoughtful and concise answers highlighting your strengths and experiences. It’s crucial to take time to reflect on your previous experiences and accomplishments, and think about how they relate to the job you’re interviewing for. You can use this information to craft specific examples showcasing your skills and demonstrating why you’re the right candidate. Once you’ve identified potential interview questions , try practicing your responses out loud or with a friend. This will not only help you become more comfortable with your answers, but it will also give you a chance to receive feedback and make adjustments as needed. Remember, the goal is not to memorize your responses word for word, but rather to feel confident and prepared when answering questions during the actual interview. By practicing ahead of time, you’ll be able to articulate your thoughts clearly and effectively, leaving a lasting impression on your interviewer. 3. Demonstrate enthusiasm Demonstrating enthusiasm is a critical aspect of any successful interview . Enthusiasm shows the interviewer that you are genuinely interested in the position and eager to contribute to the company. One way to show enthusiasm is to research the company and the role thoroughly, and express excitement about specific aspects of the job or the company’s mission. You can also demonstrate enthusiasm through your body language , tone of voice, and level of engagement during the interview. Make sure to maintain good eye contact , smile, and nod along when appropriate to show that you are actively listening and engaged in the conversation. Additionally, asking thoughtful questions about the company and the role can demonstrate your enthusiasm and interest. Some suggestions for questions to ask include: How would you define success in this role? What is the team culture like? What challenges has the company faced recently, and how have they responded? Do you have any reservations about my credentials? By asking these types of questions, you can demonstrate your enthusiasm and knowledge about the company, while also showing that you are willing to go above and beyond to learn more about the role and the company culture, which can help you stand out from other candidates. 4. Show professionalism While enthusiasm is important, it’s also crucial to maintain a professional demeanor during your interview. This means dressing appropriately, arriving on time, and being courteous and respectful to everyone you encounter, from the receptionist to the hiring manager . It’s also important to be aware of your language and tone during the interview. Avoid using slang or overly casual language, and instead, speak clearly and professionally. This will show the interviewer that you take the opportunity seriously and are capable of representing the company in a professional manner. Remember, the interview is your chance to make a great first impression , so take it seriously and show the interviewer that you are a capable and professional candidate. You don’t have to be overly formal, but it’s important to demonstrate that you are experienced and ready to take on the role. 5. Follow up After a successful interview , be sure to express your gratitude with a heartfelt thank-you note or email. This is the perfect opportunity to reinforce your enthusiastic interest and show appreciation for being considered. In your message, make sure to reference specific aspects of the interview that you found particularly interesting or valuable. This shows the interviewer that you were actively engaged in the conversation and took the opportunity seriously. Following up can also give you an opportunity to address any concerns or questions that may have come up during the interview. For example, if the interviewer expressed reservations about your qualifications, you can use the follow-up email to provide additional information or clarify any misunderstandings. Similarly, if the interviewer suggested that you take on certain tasks or research more information about the company, mention this in your thank-you note and be sure to follow through with what was requested. Interviewing skills to master Now that you know the various interview tips and keys, it’s time to develop your interviewing skills . In conjunction with the 3 C’s and the above tips, additional skills to master include: Research As you have probably already noticed, research is key in any interview, whether you are a job seeker or a recruiter . Learn as much as possible about the company’s history and culture, their products and services, their competitors, and other relevant information. If you’re a recruiter , research the candidate’s background, skills, and experience. Question formulation It’s not enough to just ask questions; you need to be able to craft questions that will elicit meaningful responses from your interviewee . Consider the types of questions you want to ask and how they relate to the goal of the interview. For the job seeker , you want to ask questions that will demonstrate your qualifications, while a recruiter wants to ask questions that will identify the best fit for their organization. Active listening Interviews are a two-way conversation; it’s important to not just listen but actively listen to what is said and draw meaningful conclusions from the responses. Listen carefully to the answers and follow up with probing questions. Good listening skills are essential in any interview setting. Engaging the interviewee The best interviews are those that engage both parties. Ask questions that make the interviewee feel comfortable and provide an opportunity to share their experiences. Ensure you give them enough time to answer and encourage them to elaborate on their responses, if necessary. What are some common interviewing styles? Since preparation is key when it comes to interviews, one of the best ways you can get ready for your upcoming one is by understanding what type of interview to expect. With various interviewing styles used by employers nowadays, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with the various types and the best ways to prepare for each. The most common styles of interviewing include: The Traditional Interview The traditional interview style is usually conducted in person or over the phone and consists of a series of questions asked by the interviewer. This type of interview is generally very structured and focuses on the candidate’s background and experience. The Video Interview With the increasing prevalence of remote work, video interviews have become more popular. They allow employers to conduct interviews with candidates who are not local or cannot attend an in-person interview. Video interviews can be conducted live or pre-recorded, and can range from one-on-one interviews to panel interviews. The Behavioral Interview The behavioral based interviews focus on the candidate’s past behavior in order to get an understanding of how they might act in the future. This type of interview typically involves open-ended behavioral interview questions that require the candidate to give specific examples of how they handled certain situations in the past. The Panel Interview The panel interview is conducted with a group of two or more people, typically from the company. This type of interview allows the employer to get multiple perspectives on the candidates in order to make an informed decision. The panelist may ask similar questions in order to compare responses, or they may focus on different topics. The Group Interview Group interviews involve multiple candidates being interviewed at the same time. This type of interview is often used in retail or hospitality industries, where teamwork and communication are essential. Group interviews allow employers to assess how candidates interact with others and work in a team setting.

All candidates are different and it's your job as the interviewer to draw out the best answers to help you make an informed decision on who would be the best fit for the role. No two interviews are alike, so coming up with the right questions to ask can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore 10 of the best questions to ask when interviewing someone that will help you assess their strength and suitability to a role as well as whether they are the right fit for your company. Question 1: What do you know about our company and why do you want to work here? This is a good icebreaker. Interviews are understandably a nerve-racking situation and it's a good idea to open with a question that allows your candidate to warm up. On top of that, this question allows you two key insights that may make or break the interview right from the start. The first is whether they are willing to do their homework and research your company before coming in. The second is whether they have taken the time to understand what makes your company unique and how they as a person would gel within the company culture. Question 2: Name a work accomplishment that makes you proud? Again, this is a multi-pronged question. On the one hand, you're asking about their work experience and how they fared in previous roles. You get a glimpse into the work they've done in the past and see how that translates to the work they'll be expected to do in the future. But, perhaps more important than that, this question provides the candidate an opportunity to show their spark. What drives them to wake up in the morning? What makes them passionate about their working skills? Are they motivated by intrinsic goals like personal growth or something more extrinsic like customer satisfaction. Question 3: How do you handle situations where you need to work with someone who has a different opinion than yourself? This is one of the best questions to ask a potential employee if you're looking for someone who truly understands the collaborative nature of being part of a team. It's important for your candidate to be able to work with others, even in situations where they may not always agree. This helps you gauge their level of experience and insight when it comes to working in a team setting, and their ability to bridge gaps between opinions and come up with solutions that benefit everyone. It also shows you how they cope when faced with difficult choices and how they prioritize the overall goal of any project. Question 4: What is your biggest weakness? Known as the classic interview question and for good reason. Asking someone to reveal their biggest weakness can be a daunting task but it's often one of the best questions you can ask during an interview as it gives you an insight into the self-awareness of a candidate. Candidates want to focus on their positive traits but forcing them to dwell on the negative can be really illuminating. Do they understand their limitations? Are they able to recognize their own areas of improvement? Are they open to receiving feedback and learning from their mistakes? It's so important to understand how well a candidate can self-reflect and use that insight to take ownership over their own development. As such it is one of the best questions to ask employee during interview. Question 5: What skills and strengths do you bring to this position? This question allows the candidate to direct the conversation and showcase what they can bring to the table. It also gives an opportunity for them to show off their knowledge and passion for the role and how it fits into their professional development. Most importantly, this question allows you to assess how well they understand the job requirements and how they would apply their unique set of skills. It's a great way to determine if they are the right fit for your company and the open position. Question 6: Tell me about a time when you resolved a conflict in the workplace This is a classic STAR question (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and it allows you to delve deep into a candidate's experience with problem-solving. While no-one ever wants problems to arise at work, the reality is that they often do, and it's so important to understand how a candidate would handle such a situation. You can get an insight into how they plan, strategize and ultimately solve conflicts. This question can help you determine if the candidate is a proactive problem solver or whether they are more of a reactive one. It's also a great way to assess their communication and collaboration skills and get an understanding of how they would handle any future conflicts. Question 7: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

MI is a form of therapy that seeks to empower individuals by helping them explore and resolve any ambivalence they are feeling with regard to the change they want to make in their lives. The goal of motivational interviewing is to bridge the gap between an individual's current behavior and their desired goal by helping them understand their underlying motivations and resolve any conflicting feelings. To accomplish this, MI relies on several key principles that foster positive behavior change. Whether you are a mental health practitioner or looking to improve your life, this guide to motivational interviewing techniques will offer practical advice for fostering positive results. A Primer on Motivational Interviewing Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach to therapy developed in the early 1980s. It is a collaborative, non-confrontational method of engaging with clients whose goal is to help them explore and resolve any ambivalence they are feeling with regard to making a change. MI is based on the idea that individuals are more likely to make positive behavior changes when they come to the decision themselves and not as a result of external pressure or coercion. The approach seeks to foster autonomy by helping people understand their own motivations while also providing support and understanding. This unique approach starkly contrasts traditional forms of therapy, which often rely on teaching or instructing the client. In MI, the therapist's role is more akin to that of a coach or facilitator, as opposed to an authority figure. This means that the techniques employed must be tailored to the individual's needs rather than being prescriptive or directive. A common motivational interviewing example is the use of open-ended questions to invite clients to explore and reflect on their own thoughts, feelings, and values. MI practitioners also use reflective listening techniques to better understand the client's perspective and internal experience. What Are The 4 Processes of Motivational Interviewing? Within the MI framework are four primary processes that allow a practitioner to effectively and holistically engage with their clients. These steps in motivational interviewing include engaging, focusing, evoking, and planning. These processes allow the therapist to gain an understanding of the individual and foster positive behavior change. Step 1. Engaging This process involves developing a strong connection with the client and building trust. The goal is to create a safe space for clients to explore their ambivalence about making a change in their lives. Step 2.Focusing This process involves helping the client identify their goals and objectives and exploring any barriers that may be preventing them from achieving those goals. By focusing on the individual's aspirations, therapists can help them to develop a plan for positive behavior change. Step 3. Evoking This process involves exploring the client's inner motivations and examining why they want to make a change in their life. It also allows individuals to better understand any conflicting feelings that are preventing them from making progress. A motivational interviewing example may include an individual desiring to quit smoking but struggling to find the motivation. By exploring the individual's deeper motivations and understanding any potential roadblocks to success, therapists can help guide clients toward positive behavior change. Step 4. Planning This process involves setting goals and objectives and developing strategies for achieving them. It also involves exploring ways to deal with any potential setbacks or challenges that might arise along the way. By utilizing these steps in Motivational Interviewing alongside key Motivational Interviewing techniques, practitioners can help individuals to effectively make positive changes in their lives. The goal is to support autonomy and foster client-driven behavior change - which can open the door to greater psychological well-being and improved quality of life. What Are The 5 Principles of Motivational Interviewing? At the heart of motivational interviewing are five key principles which guide the therapist in fostering positive behavior change. These include: Express Empathy Develop Discrepancy Avoid Argumentation Roll with Resistance Support Self-Efficacy Let's break down each and how the various techniques of MI can be put into practice: 1. Express Empathy One of the key components of MI is the ability to empathize with the client. This means putting yourself in their shoes and understanding how they are feeling without judgment or criticism. The goal is to demonstrate understanding and acceptance of the individual's feelings. Empathy can be expressed through active listening skills such as paraphrasing and reflective responses. For instance, if a client is expressing frustration at their lack of progress, you could say something like, \"It sounds like you are feeling frustrated at the current pace of change.\" The goal is to use this technique to understand the individual's perspective rather than to confront or challenge it. This allows for a more open and honest dialogue, which can be essential in uncovering any ambivalence or conflict. Motivational interviewing Techniques for Expressing Empathy: • Active listening: Listening without judgment or criticism • Paraphrasing: Restating the individual's words in your own words • Reflective responses: Summarizing the individual's feelings and experiences • Open-ended questions: Asking questions that encourage exploration of thoughts and feelings 2. Develop Discrepancy Discrepancy is the process of helping someone to recognize the difference between their current behavior and the desired outcome they are striving for. This involves exploring the individual's motivations and understanding what factors may prevent them from achieving their goals. It is important to remember that the goal here is not to impose your own values or set unrealistic expectations but rather to help the individual recognize the gap between where they are now and where they would like to be in the future. During this process, it can also be beneficial to explore potential solutions and different strategies for overcoming any obstacles. This helps foster a sense of control and autonomy, which can be vital in making positive behavior changes. Motivational interviewing Techniques for Developing Discrepancy: • Exploring motivations: Understanding why the individual wants to make a change • Goal setting: Setting realistic and achievable goals for reaching desired outcomes • Problem-solving: Identifying potential solutions and strategies for overcoming obstacles • Empowerment: Encouraging autonomy and fostering self-confidence in decision-making 3. Avoid Argumentation In MI, argumentation should be avoided at all costs. This means refraining from making judgments or questioning the individual's beliefs or feelings. Instead of trying to persuade someone through facts or logic, it is more effective to focus on helping them to understand their own values and motivations. The aim is to foster an atmosphere of understanding and acceptance rather than trying to convince someone that they should change their behavior. This approach has been proven to be more effective in helping people make positive changes in the long term. Motivational interviewing Techniques for Avoiding Argumentation: • Open-ended questions: Asking questions that encourage exploration rather than confrontation • Non-judgmental statements: Avoiding criticism or judgment of the individual's thoughts and feelings • Reframing: Re-framing statements in a positive light to help the individual recognize their own values and motivations • Empowerment: Encouraging autonomy and self-determination in decision-making. 4. Roll With Resistance Resistance is a normal part of the change process, so it's essential not to take any resistance personally or react negatively to it. Instead, try to identify what may be causing the individual to resist making a change and work with them toward overcoming any barriers that are present. One technique that can be used here is reframing - this means looking at the situation from a different perspective which can help to uncover any underlying beliefs or assumptions which may be causing the resistance. This helps to shift the focus away from any potential negative consequences and instead look at the positive aspects of making a change. Motivational interviewing Techniques for Rolling With Resistance: • Engaging in “Change Talk”: Asking questions that help the individual explore the potential benefits of change • Allowing for Reflection: Encouraging the individual to take some time to consider their options and reflect on how they are feeling • Reframing: Looking at the situation from a different perspective in order to uncover any underlying beliefs or assumptions which may be causing resistance • Empowerment: Supporting autonomy and fostering self-confidence in decision-making. 5. Support Self-Efficacy Finally, it's important to remember that the ultimate goal of MI is to help individuals gain a sense of self-efficacy and confidence in their own abilities. This means providing them with support and reassurance throughout the process and helping them recognize their successes along the way. Creating an atmosphere of trust and acceptance can foster an environment where individuals feel empowered to take ownership of their behaviors and make lasting changes. Self-efficacy creates the drive and motivation needed to sustain any changes made, so it is crucial to nurture this throughout the process. Motivational interviewing Techniques for Supporting Self-Efficacy: • Positive reinforcement: Recognizing and acknowledging successes throughout the process • Providing resources: Connecting individuals with the necessary skills, information, and support they need to reach their goals • Celebrating milestones: Taking time to recognize each milestone or success along the way • Reflection: Helping individuals reflect on their progress and lessons learned. Implementing Motivational interviewing Techniques Motivational interviewing is an effective technique for helping individuals make positive changes in their lives. By understanding the core principles of MI and implementing the key techniques outlined above, you can create a supportive environment that encourages autonomy and self-determination in decision-making. By avoiding argumentation and rolling with resistance, you can help individuals gain a sense of self-efficacy and confidence in their own abilities. This will provide them with the drive and motivation they need to make lasting changes, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for all involved. With the right approach, motivational interviewing can be invaluable for helping individuals move forward with their lives. This will help both yourself and the individual to achieve positive outcomes, as well as create lasting improvements in both attitude and behavior.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter 05/17/23 The different interviewing styles of hiring managers Share this article Have you ever been headhunted by a hiring manager? Well, this recruitment method is actually gaining popularity worldwide as hiring managers start to rely heavily on social media platforms such as LinkedIn to identify candidates who are a good fit and open to new opportunities. But when it comes to the interview stage, you should be aware of the various interviewing styles hiring managers are starting to use. From the STAR interview method to logical thinking and puzzles, in this article, we’re going to discuss the different types of interviewing styles being used today, smart interview techniques used by headhunters to filter through candidates, and how you can truly impress. So, whether you’ve been invited to have a coffee and casual chat with a headhunter, a virtual interview with a hiring manager, or a phone interview with a global brand, grab a coffee and let’s get into it! What Are The 7 Different Types Of Interviewing Styles? First, let’s kick things off with the different types of interviews being used by hiring managers both in the US and overseas. 1: Traditional Interview Technique If you’re an experienced professional with a wealth of experience under your belt, you’ve probably experienced more than one traditional interview technique. This is where you’ll sit face to face with the recruiter, headhunter or hiring manager and go through a series of standard interview questions that helps you to share your skills and experience with the interviewer. Traditional interviews are generally formal and last anywhere from 15 minutes up to an hour. 2: Phone Interview You might be asked to have a phone interview as a screening process. It tends to be used to quickly filter out any candidates that don’t have the right level of experience or don’t give a positive first impression. This helps to save hiring managers precious time and can be a great way to speak to candidates who aren’t local or able to attend in-person interviews. 3: Video Interview Technique During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual video interviews gained momentum on a global scale. And as we emerge into a post-pandemic era, it still remains one of the most popular interview techniques to use. A step up from a phone interview, a video interview allows the hiring manager or headhunter to see the candidate, observe their body language and facial cues and gain a better understanding of their personality too. 4: Group Interviewing Style In a group interview, multiple candidates are interviewed at the same time in order to analyze a person’s leadership skills, teamwork, and confidence. If you’ve been invited to a group interview, you’ll need to really stand out, but for all the right reasons. So make sure you speak up and voice your opinions but in a diplomatic and friendly way. 5: Pitching & Challenges Pitching and challenges, on the other hand, are used to evaluate a candidate's creativity, problem-solving skills, and communication skills. In this type of interview, the candidate is given a task to complete within a certain timeframe or a deadline, such as presenting a sales pitch or solving a problem. Generally speaking, it’s used for roles that require these skills on a daily basis. 6: Panel Interview A panel interview is a type of interview where the candidate is interviewed by multiple interviewers at the same time. This type of interview is used to get a more comprehensive assessment of the candidate's skills and experience. 7: Behavioral Interview In a behavioral interview, the interviewer will ask the candidate questions about how they have handled specific situations in the past that are directly or, in some cases, indirectly related to the role in question. This type of interview is used to evaluate a candidate's problem-solving skills, communication skills, and decision-making abilities. What Are The Top 3 Types Of Interviews? Now let’s talk about the different types of interviews you might be asked to attend and how you should prepare for each one. Virtual Interviews As we mentioned above, more hiring managers are using virtual interviews as they’re more convenient and cost-effective than asking you to come into the office. Plus, it also allows headhunters and hiring managers to interview candidates that may be abroad or too far from the office to take part in a traditional in-person interview process. So, rather than restrict the role to local talent, hiring managers can cast their net further afield and source top talent from almost anywhere in the world! If you want to ace a virtual interview, you should spend time checking your video and audio equipment before the interview takes place. There is nothing worse than struggling with software when trying to appear professional, organized and collected. You should also have a pen and paper handy to write down any key information during the call and have some questions to ask the interviewer at the end of the call. Casual Coffee Interviews Never underestimate the power of a casual coffee interview. In fact, this is often used by headhunters to catch candidates off-guard and to gain a better understanding of someone’s character and values. Always keep in mind that this is an informal interview, so while you can be more relaxed and casual and bring your personality to the table, keep topics professional and positive. Refrain from talking about your personal life or complaining about your current situation or the business you work for. Instead, focus on learning more about the opportunities the hiring manager has and how they could help you advance in your career and gain more skills and experience. Test & Challenge-Based Interviewing Styles Interviews that consist of tests and other challenges are also gaining popularity, particularly for positions in the STEM fields. During these interviews, a candidate's logical reasoning, problem-solving ability, and creative thinking are evaluated for possible employment. These frequently entail the candidate working through a series of puzzles or riddles. These tend to be reserved for roles within the technology sector and digital innovation, although they are starting to appear in interviews for opportunities within business development and marketing too. What Are The Best 5 Interview Techniques? Let’s say you are preparing for an interview in the next couple of days. What can you do to optimize your chances of being hired? Dress For The Role You Want Physical appearance is critical whether you’re on a video call, you’re facing a panel, or you are meeting for a coffee with a headhunter. Dress for the role you want, not your current position. So, if you’re hoping to become a manager, you’ll need to appear sophisticated, well-dressed, and presentable. If you know the company is more laid-back and creative, dress in a smart yet creative way to demonstrate to the hiring manager that you’d be an excellent company fit. Act As Though You’ve Already Been Hired Acting as though you've already been hired is a psychological trick that can help you not only become more relaxed during an interview but also help the recruiter to think of you as already being part of the company. Use questions such as, ‘When I join the company, what does the onboarding process look like?’ This shows that you are so confident that you have the skills and experience necessary that you’ve already mentally committed to the idea of being hired and are thinking about the next steps of joining the company. It also demonstrates your eagerness to learn and integrate into the company's culture, which can leave a positive impression on the recruiter. Sell Yourself, Your Personality, Skills & Experience Selling yourself involves highlighting your skills, experience, and personality in a way that demonstrates why you are the best candidate for the job. It's essential to be clear and concise when describing your strengths and accomplishments, so have this prepared in advance so that you communicate it effortlessly. Be A Breath Of Fresh Air Being a breath of fresh air means bringing something unique and positive to the interview. This can be done by expressing your passion for the role or by sharing an interesting or inspiring story. Perhaps the hiring manager has been carrying out interviews all day. In this case, appearing light, positive and energetic can help you stand out. End With Clear Next Steps Ending the interview with clear next steps shows that you are organized and prepared. It's essential to thank the interviewer for their time and to ask about the next steps in the hiring process. Interviewing Styles Of Headhunters and Hiring Managers? The STAR Interview Method The Strategic Task Analysis and Ranking, also known as the STAR Interview Method, is a well-known interviewing style that is utilized by headhunters and recruiting managers. It involves asking the candidate to elaborate on a particular circumstance, job duty, course of action, and outcome connected to their previous experience. The candidate's problem-solving abilities and their capacity for decision-making are both evaluated through the use of this method. ² It’s also similar to the situational interviewing style, which involves asking the candidate to describe how they would handle a specific situation to evaluate critical thinking and decision-making skills. Stress Interview Technique If you feel as though you’ve been put under immense pressure during an interview process, then the hiring manager may be using the stress interview technique. This interviewing style is used to test a person’s ability to react under pressure, which could be key to being successful in the role. Although it might feel as though you’re being interrogated, it can quickly assess whether you’re right for the opportunity and will feel comfortable working in such a high-stress environment long-term. Behavioral Interview Technique The behavioral interviewing style involves asking the candidate to describe how they have handled specific situations in the past. This method is used to evaluate a candidate's problem-solving skills, communication skills, and decision-making abilities. Use storytelling to impress hiring managers and showcase your ability to gain and maintain someone’s attention. This can often be an essential skill within sales and marketing roles. Final Thoughts Interviews are still a critical part of the digital recruitment process, and it's essential to choose the right type of interview and interview style to evaluate a candidate's skills, experience, and cultural fit. By understanding the different types of interviewing styles and the best interview techniques as a prospect, you can better prepare for an upcoming interview and increase your chances of success!

Shruti was previously the founder and COO of Move Loot, an online marketplace for buying and selling used furniture. She shared about her expertise in hiring thousands of hourly workers for a successful logistics start-up. Move Loot offers a much-needed service to individuals, by optimizing one's time and money while offering a unique user-friendly experience in buying and selling used furniture. It is currently the only provider of such services in the market. They realize that in bid to avoid the hassle, most people end up buying new items, harming their wallets and the planet! Move Loot solved this dilemma by creating an online marketplace where users can post furniture to sell, find furniture to purchase, and select delivery personnel to complete the process. At Move Loot, Shruti led national expansion and general business operations. Over the course of three years, she and her co-founding team raised $22 million dollars to scale the business across the United States. Move Loot was featured in numerous publications including Forbes, TechCrunch, Bloomberg Business Week, CNN, TIME, Fortune and more. Prior to Move Loot, Shruti worked at the New Schools Venture Seed Fund working with the fund partners on seed stage Ed Tech investing, and prior to that she was a public school teacher. She was honored by Forbes as a 2016 30 Under 30 recipient in Retail and E-Commerce and the Aspen Institute as an Aspen Ideas Festival Scholar in reimagining capitalism. Q: What have your experiences been with hiring hourly workers? Shruti: At Move Loot, we hired a few hundred hourly employees to help us in running our truck and warehouse operations. Our hourly workers were W-2 employees - not contractors. At times when we were scaling quickly, we had to leverage external staffing agencies, like Blue Crew and Wonolo, to be able to hire sufficiently and meet the needs of our customers. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: With Job Board Integrations and Smart Sponsorship , you are able to hire efficiently and effectively without having to rely on external staffing agencies, and reach candidates across over 25,000 job boards with a single click. AI is also used to optimized job postings to maximize post views, while a streamlined feed ensures that all of your hiring resources are consolidated into one platform. Q: What has worked most for you when hiring hourly workers? Shruti: We would often hire through Blue Crew or Wonolo with the intent of converting some of those employees. We also created a group hiring strategy where we would email all of the hourly workers that applied for roles and encouraged them to attend an information session about the job. Once the session was over, we would ask those who were still interested to stay for interviews. This helped us with scheduling interviews and hiring people in batches. It also allowed us to do some group interviews to get an understanding of how an individual would function as part of a group. Workstream's Hiring Tip: By utilizing workflows and stages , easily reach applicants via email or a mobile app, and review and recommend candidates easily. Instead of manually scheduling interviews, automated scheduling will also save you time by sending a text message link through Workstream (which can be integrated with your Google Calendar), allowing candidates to schedule a meeting at a mutual time of convenience. Reminders will also be sent out nearing the day of the interview to reduce ghosting, with an option to reschedule the interview if necessary. Q: Where are your go-to channels for sourcing and hiring? Shruti: ZipRecruiter, Indeed, Referrals from existing hourly workers, Craigslist, Wonolo, Blue Crew. Q: What innovative recruiting technologies or methods have you seen recently? Shruti: This is a tough one - other than Workstream , I haven't really come across anything that innovative - hiring hourly workers can be a huge challenge for a variety of reasons including communication (not everyone checks email/has reliable phone communication), turnover, location changes etc - so what Workstream is doing is really cool.

Businesses like fast food chains and retail stores have tried to reduce human interaction by encouraging take-outs and delivery orders , and delivery companies have begun implementing contactless delivery services - all in a bid to increase social distancing and reduce the chances of the virus spreading. When coming up with interview questions for potential hourly hires, you need to clearly articulate the role, the outcomes that the role is responsible for, and the skills needed to succeed. You can create scenario-based questions to get a better insight into the applicant’s thought process and how skilled they are in dealing with a variety of situations commonly encountered when carrying out their tasks. We also suggest that applicants are interviewed first by a senior member of your company if possible; for example, a hiring manager who has experience as a deliveryman . These individuals would know the best ways to deal with difficult situations specific to delivery and would thus be able to assess candidates’ responses to scenario-based questions better. Lastly, given how important it is now to place a strong emphasis on one’s own hygiene and health, it is essential that you incorporate an element of personal responsibility into your selection process. Scenario questions about how the delivery staff will react during this outbreak period can also help you filter for the stronger candidates. Here is a potential list of interview questions you can ask: Travel History and Exposure Have you travelled out of the country in the past 21 days? In the past 21 days, have you been in contact with a sick person who has traveled out of the country? Have you been in close contact with someone exhibiting flu-like symptoms? Experience and Availability Have you previously worked in the same industry? Which days of the week are you available to work? What shift(s) are you available to work? Morning (8:00 am to 12:00 pm); Afternoon (12:00 pm to 5:00 pm); Evening (5:00 pm to 10:00 pm) Total Hours Available Per Week? Are you available to work on: Weekends; Holidays; Neither? What are some of the things you’ve done before to exceed a customer’s expectations? Scenario Questions Now that our company is implementing contactless delivery, what will you do if a customer insists that you deliver the food to him or her face to face? What would you do if you noticed that the drop-off spot for the food (e.g. the customer’s front door) is very dirty? Questions on personal habits* How do you keep yourself updated on the coronavirus situation? What are the best practices to curb the spread of the virus? *Knowing how proactive the candidate is in following official announcements and educating himself about updates can give you a better insight as to how much he cares about proposed measures to curb the spread of the virus. With the right set of questions, you can hire hourly workers who are as invested as you are in their personal safety, and that of your customers and other employees as well.

In 2019, there were as many as 15 million workers employed in the private sector manufacturing industry . It’s a tough field to be hiring for, with tons of competition, so it’s doubly thrilling to be able to complete a hire. After you've gone through the process of attracting the qualified prospect you want to work in your company, then completing the interview process and background check, now you get the pleasure of offering the position to a job candidate. One way to let your future manufacturing employee know that you want them for the open position is the job offer letter. This is a letter that simply explains that you would like the candidate to work for you. Some people make it complicated, but it doesn't have to be. In fact, there are just three things you need to remember to include in a job offer letter to protect both you and the job candidate: the offer of the position, the detail of the position, and some legal considerations. Why a Letter The job offer letter isn't required in order for you to hire someone, but it is recommended. When you've decided to offer a position of employment to a candidate, you can simply pick up the phone and call that person to let them know they got the job if they want it. Many employers still handle this next-to-last-step in the hiring process, (behind onboarding), this way. But an offer letter simply adds another layer of protection for you, the organization, and the employee . The letter spells out what the position is, the name of the person accepting the position, and additional information that was discussed in the advertisement of the position as well as the interview. You’ll want to cover the legalities and job details in a congratulatory and professional tone. The Offer This is a wonderful opportunity for both you and the candidate. You found a qualified applicant to fill a position that will help the company generate profit. This is exciting! Write the offer letter with this in mind. Some candidates have been looking for gainful employment for a very long time. Others may be using this job as a stepping stone to other things, and still others may just be bouncing from job to job, but that's okay. It doesn't matter. The job offer letter you send, just as with other company correspondence and marketing publications, should be written out of compassion and cheerfulness. Think of the offer letter as a communication tool to not only let the candidate know that you like them and see them as valuable to the company, but also to send a message of what the company culture is like . Even if a candidate moves on from the company six months later, they will hopefully remember the words and tone you used in that job offer letter they received and may even tell their friends and associates. Legal Stuff This is an area that many employers choose to avoid, thinking they will get in trouble if they put anything legal in an offer letter. The point of this section is to communicate to the job candidate that there are some things that need to be considered when accepting the position . For example, including some language that lets the candidate know that the offer letter is not an employment contract. You should include a written statement that employment with the company is at will, meaning that the employment relationship may be terminated by the employer or employee at any time and for any or no reason (check your state laws first). According to a recent Society for Human Resources (SHRM) article , \"A contract binds both the employer and the employee; an at-will statement may alleviate that commitment. If statements were made by the employer during the interview process, either orally or in writing (e.g., in an offer letter), that imply an employment agreement, then the employer may have an obligation to uphold it as a contract. The employers should seek legal guidance in those matters.\" This is also a great section to let the candidate know if they will be considered either as an exempt or nonexempt status. To be exempt means they are typically salaried and therefore don't receive overtime pay and may not be eligible for minimum wage. The nonexempt employees are typically hourly employees. To get a better understanding, visit the US Department of Labor website under Wage and Hour Division . You will also want to include any contingencies here. An example could be that, \"This offer is contingent upon completion of an I-9 form as well as any other background checks, drug screens, physicals, or confidentiality agreements,\" that you require employees to complete. Creating the Letter Don't try to create your job offer letters from scratch; a simple search of sample job offer templates will bring up thousands for you. Make sure that you proofread the letter several times and have others look over it as well so that it reflects your company's values and mission. At the end of the letter, create a space for the job candidate's signature and date. Also, include a line that lets the job candidate know that the job description for the position is attached and that document further explains what is expected if they accept the job offer. Sending a job offer should be an exciting time for both the sender and receiver. It should be thought of as a kind of proposal for the beginning of a wonderful relationship. You found someone qualified for the job and they found a company to work for. It is an exciting collaboration that will hopefully be long-lasting and profitable for everyone. Workstream tip: There are different resources online that provide help with creating a job offer letter or even offer downloads which you can customize for your own use. You can find a great sample to send out to your manufacturing hourly workers, such as this one : Dear Candidate: We are pleased to confirm you have been selected to work for [ company/org. name ] as \"warehouse worker\".

Not only this; what if it held power to improve company culture and increase employee engagement ? Let’s explore how these seemingly simple questionnaires can transform attrition into actionable insights . Understanding the Importance of Exit Surveys Let's talk about exit surveys . They're not just another form to fill out, but a critical tool in understanding why employees decide to leave. Gallup says that replacing an employee can cost up to twice their annual salary. So, reducing unwanted attrition is key. The purpose of exit surveys isn't just about tallying reasons for departure; it’s about diving deeper into an employee's decision and getting valuable insights . This feedback helps us understand our company culture better and even identify development opportunities we may have missed. The Role of Exit Surveys in Employee Retention When conducted effectively, exit surveys are like gold mines for improving staff retention. They highlight trends and areas where we need improvement—making them essential tools for human resources professionals looking to keep talent within the organization. A good exit survey asks hard-hitting questions that make people pause and think before answering—it's not enough simply to know they’re leaving because they found alternative employment or want more work-life balance —we must strive towards creating a great place where future employees will love working at. In essence, conducting comprehensive exit interviews allows us insight into how well job descriptions meet expectations, which could help improve onboarding processes for new hires too. To get you started on this journey of discovery through data collection here’s a helpful Employee Exit Interview Survey template . Designing Effective Exit Surveys Creating an exit survey that delivers actionable insights requires a careful blend of quantitative and qualitative questions. Well-designed exit surveys allow companies to understand employees' decisions to leave, highlight areas for improvement, and provide data to help reduce staff turnover. An effective exit survey template starts with asking the right questions. A good mix of open-ended and close-ended questions ensures you get both in-depth responses as well as easily measurable data. Leveraging Technology in Administering Exit Surveys The use of technology can greatly streamline the process of administering exit surveys . Digital platforms not only save time but also encourage departing employees to be more candid in their feedback. A digital platform allows you to automate sending out your surveys when employees decide it’s time to move on, ensuring no valuable insights are missed. This automatic dispatch also reduces potential bias or influence from human resources personnel during this sensitive transition period for exiting employees . Digital solutions can even handle analysis duties – tracking trends, comparing feedback across departments or demographics, and making sense of complex sentiment expressed through text answers - truly bringing into light potential issues within company culture needing attention. Conducting Effective Exit Surveys , a guide we found particularly helpful, suggests using online tools which let respondents take the survey at their convenience, giving them enough space and freedom for providing honest feedback . Actionable Insights : By allowing anonymous responses via online surveys , it enhances the chances of receiving unfiltered views about work-life balance concerns or development opportunities lacking within the organization structure. Data Analysis: This method gives us a statistical edge over face-to-face interviews because analyzing numerical data is straightforward while deciphering sentiments from verbal cues can be subjective. Consistency: Digital platforms maintain a consistent line of questioning for all respondents, eliminating potential bias or variance in the way questions are asked. In short, by making use of technology in your exit survey process, you're setting yourself up to gather data that is more reliable and useful - helping create a great place to work. Embracing Technology: Let's use digital platforms to automatically send out surveys when an employee chooses to leave. Distinguishing Between Regrettable And Non-Regrettable Attrition Attrition is a natural part of the employee life cycle. But not all attrition is created equal. There's regrettable attrition , when your top talent decides to pack up and leave. Then there's non-regrettable attrition , where you might even breathe a sigh of relief. The trick lies in identifying which is which. Enter: exit surveys . By categorizing exit survey respondents into \"regrettable\" or \"non-regrettable\", we can better prioritize action based on exit survey results. Prioritizing Action Based on Exit Survey Results A good starting point? Comparing experiences between these two groups using data from their exit interview surveys. Why did employees decide to leave? What was their experience working with us like? We might discover that our 'regrettably' departed had issues with work-life balance or felt they didn't have enough career development opportunities - valuable insights for future improvements. Perhaps they found alternative employment offering more advancement opportunity, shedding light on potential areas for organizational performance enhancement. Carefully analyzing this feedback can help us understand why some people leave while others stay, helping fix what needs fixing and retaining more top-tier talent. Gaining Insights from Departed Employees Every departing employee carries away knowledge about company culture and processes; but thanks to well-designed exit surveys we get an opportunity to gain those insights back. They offer candid feedback about what it’s really like at the coalface – the stuff you won’t find in any job description . \"People will forget what you said... but they will never forget how you made them feel.\" - Maya Angelou The exit process is an opportunity to leave employees feeling valued and respected. And who knows? They might even become ambassadors for your brand, recommending it as a great place to work. In short, regrettable or not, every employee's departure can be turned into an opportunity. So let’s make the most of those exit surveys . Key Takeaway: Employee turnover isn't always a downside. With exit surveys , we distinguish between 'regrettable' and 'non-regrettable' exits, helping us zero in on areas for enhancement. Candid feedback from exiting team members - whether they're off to greener pastures or just moving forward - lets us pinpoint and fix the glitches. Key Themes to Measure in an Exit Survey Exit surveys provide a wealth of insights about your company culture , and there are certain key themes you need to measure for the most actionable results. These crucial aspects include experience versus expectations, likelihood to recommend, sense of belonging within the organization, and the possibility that employees would consider rejoining. The Role of Exit Interviews in the Off-Boarding Process Exit interviews play a pivotal role in an employee's off-boarding process. It is not just about saying goodbye, but more importantly, it’s about understanding why employees decide to leave and using that information to make improvements. Maximizing Insights from Exit Interviews An exit interview gives departing employees a platform to share their experience working at your organization. This feedback can provide valuable insights into areas like company culture , work-life balance , or career development opportunities. But how do we ensure this feedback is honest and constructive? To start with, making sure the interview is voluntary goes a long way towards ensuring candid feedback. Employees should be given the opportunity to provide feedback without feeling obligated, so they can help create a better workplace for future employees. Maintaining confidentiality during these sessions also encourages open communication which leads us closer towards understanding the true reasons behind each employee's decision to leave. Here are 30 sample questions you could use during such interviews. The objective isn’t necessarily retention or persuading an exiting employee not to leave – though if their concerns highlight issues that can be fixed immediately then retaining talent becomes possible - but rather collecting actionable insights on what may need fixing or improving within your organization. Leveraging Feedback from Employee Exit Surveys When an employee decides to leave, it's crucial to ask the right exit survey questions. It can help you understand their decision and gain valuable insights into your company culture and work-life balance . This data is like gold dust - precious but often overlooked. Employee exit surveys are a great way for HR professionals to get candid feedback on why employees decide to seek alternative employment. By analyzing this interview data, we can start fixing potential issues in our retention strategy that may have gone unnoticed otherwise. The Culture Amp platform, for instance, lets us automatically send online surveys when someone leaves. It gives us a wealth of actionable insights straight from departing employees ' mouths about their experience working with us – be it related to career development or meeting expectations. The beauty of these surveys lies in how they light potential areas where we might improve employee engagement and experience. For example, maybe staff turnover is high because there aren't enough advancement opportunities? Or perhaps people exit because the job description didn't meet expectations? A key stat here: feedback from employee exit surveys provides powerful insight into company culture (yes.), highlighting both strengths and weaknesses. In fact, reviewing aggregate results offers overall views on the employee experience helping organizations retain talent better. We've all heard \"people don’t quit jobs; they quit bosses.\" But what if they're quitting due to lack of development opportunities or poor work-life balance ? Let’s use this free template for our next exiting employees ’ interviews so we don’t waste time guessing. Analyzing Exit Survey Results Once the exit survey feedback has been acquired, it's time to dig into the data. Don't worry; you don’t need a Ph.D. in statistics for this. The purpose is to comprehend why staff are departing and what actions can be taken to enhance their experience. So, let’s start leveraging feedback from employee exit surveys today because remember – every exiting employee has a story that can help us make our company an even better place. Key Takeaway: Exit surveys give HR pros a wealth of info, revealing why folks decide to move on. By asking smart questions and really digging into the responses, we can spot any hiccups in our plans to keep people around - maybe there's not enough room for growth or job expectations aren't being met. This input helps us see where we're strong and where we need work within our company culture , guiding us towards creating an even better place to work.

Not convinced? Let’s run through some facts. Indeed.org is one of the most frequently used job boards in the world with 250 million visitors each month . It is active in 60 countries , with 10 jobs being posted every second . However, even with those numbers to attest to Indeed’s stellar performance, we have to admit that no job board is perfect. Having spoken to many of our clients, we can say for sure that there are definitely some issues that users face. For instance, despite being able to cast a wide net to reach out to a large number of people, some have given feedback that many applicants end up not showing up for scheduled interviews. Either that, or they end up being unqualified - a sign that the screening system still needs to be improved. That being said, Indeed is still a great hiring tool to use. But how can you make the most of the platform and maximize its already amazing functions? Use it alongside Workstream! Here are just a few of the many reasons why you should. You Can Reach Out to Even More People If you are an Indeed user, fret not. Workstream is integrated with the job board so you don’t have to give that up . Workstream is not just integrated with Indeed, but also with 23 other job boards. Most of them even allow you to post for free! Having access to a wide range of job boards can definitely help you reach out to an even larger number of potential candidates. Envoy America managed to hire and onboard 980 candidates within a year after working with Workstream. Prior to using Workstream, many of our clients have said that the most time-consuming part of the hiring process is the job posting stage. They would spend hours posting across all platforms and keying in information into disorganized spreadsheets in an attempt to keep track of the applicants. With Workstream’s job board integrations, all you need to do is upload a single job posting and it will be posted to all free platforms automatically.

And it wasn’t as simple as just posting a “Help Wanted” ad in the local newspaper. You were probably very thoughtful about drafting the job posting and promoting it across several social channels. You probably spent money promoting the opening on several job boards and incentivizing employees to spread the word. You likely also interviewed several candidates, conducted drug tests and background checks, and offered a sign-on bonus to the one candidate you ultimately selected. And that’s just the beginning. You also invested time getting the new hire onboarded—by having them fill out all the paperwork required by the US Department of Labor and getting them all the training they needed to perform their job well. Needless to say, the cost to bring on one new employee adds up quickly. And losing an employee can be quite expensive because you’re losing your investment and forced to make another. According to the Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM), the average cost to get an employee replaced is estimated to be 6 to 9 months of their wage . And for hourly employees , the costs can go up to more than $5,000. Today, the cost of churn is hitting hard. The annual overall turnover rate in the US recently reached 57.3% . For the restaurant industry, which is notorious for high turnover, the rate exceeded 130%. These numbers are troublesome, but don’t let them discourage you. A study conducted by the Work Institute found that more than 75% of the causes of employee churn are very much preventable. And companies—like Chick-fil-A, Zappos, and Amazon—that hire hourly workers have much lower churn rates because they take proactive steps to better the employee experience—and you can too. 1. Improve Your Interview Process High turnover rates may be the result of hiring the wrong candidates. To prevent such occurrences, try developing hands-on interviews in addition to the conventional interview process. You do this by giving the candidate an opportunity to perform some of the tasks required to do the job, which will allow them to demonstrate their skills, talents, and knowledge early on. This will also give you a better picture of the candidate and give them an idea of what the job will entail. Make an effort to conduct this portion of the interview during peak periods so they can get a glimpse of the rapid pace of the restaurant. (You can either pay them for this \"test task\" or let them know up front that they are not on the clock during this part of the interview.) Before you start any portion of the interview process, pre-screen applicants to ensure that they meet the key requirements needed for the job. At Workstream, we provide smart screening to help you pick out the most suitable candidates based on the qualities you’re looking for in your hourly workers. Screening questions are highly customizable and the entire process is automated to save you time. 2. Strive to Engage Your Employees Employee engagement is one of those slippery terms used by human resources professionals to bring attention to the need for developing ways to get employees to love what they do. Undoubtedly, engaged employees are better employees. To improve engagement, show employees how much their work means to the company. Explain how their job has an impact on the overall customer experience and business performance. Find ways to make your employees feel a connection to what they’re doing and how it serves a purpose (beyond their paycheck). Encourage your employees to give feedback often and help them feel heard. 3. Develop Great Leaders It’s been said that most people do not leave their jobs, but rather that they leave their managers. According to a recent Gallup study , 52% of voluntarily exiting employees say that their manager or organization could have done something to prevent them from leaving their job. Focusing on improving the skills, particularly the communication skills,  of your managers and leadership team can help to reduce your company's churn rate. Managers and leaders should provide continuous feedback to their employees, giving the team credit when they’ve done something great and providing constructive coaching and feedback when they falter. One aspect of being a great leader is helping employees see their managers as someone who works alongside them—not just someone who dictates orders. Let employees see the human side of your leaders and managers. 4. Invest in Your Employees “ Your business is only as good as the employees you have onboard .” In other words, hiring your staff without sufficiently developing them likely won’t take your company very far. By equipping your employees with the right tools and knowledge for the job, their engagement and performance will likely improve. Although this may be costly in the short run, investing in employees can provide huge payoffs in the long run through better performance and lower turnover. Take the initiative to educate your employees. This doesn’t mean that you need to send them to college, but it does mean you need to help them understand how their role impacts the success of the business. Additionally, consider offering training. This can be in customer service, food handling , inventory management, etc. Invest time (and money!) into employees and watch them blossom. Attending to their development bolsters a sense of loyalty and helps to reduce the chances of them leaving the company anytime soon. Another way to invest in your workforce is through coaching . McDonald’s currently offers this to every new employee the moment they get hired . By coaching your employees early on, you have the ability to nurture them into effective future leaders. 5. Solicit Suggestions from Your Workforce This may not seem like a great step for reducing churn, but it’s an effective way to increase engagement and loyalty, two things needed to help reduce turnover. Your employees are a wealth of information, experiences, thought processes, ideas, and dreams. Tap into this extremely valuable resource to get ideas on how to improve your business. Create a suggestion box and read through the team’s suggestions once a week. You may even ask your staff to take the first hour of their shift to brainstorm ideas for solving a particular customer service issue or sales display item. Don't just ask them questions, but truly use what they provide and give them feedback on how their ideas did or did not work in a situation. Doing so will increase their loyalty and appreciation for the company. Retain Employees Ready to get started? You don’t have to implement all five strategies at once. Even if you only implement one or two, they’ll make a tremendous difference in your retention rate. And since word-of-mouth tends to travel faster in this day and age, they may even improve your hiring rate. If you’re looking for ways to streamline your hiring process, look no further. With Workstream, you can get 4x the number of qualified applicants and reduce your time-to-hire by 70%. Schedule a free demo today to find out how you can start hiring faster—and smarter.

As industries evolve and your employees gain tenure, you might begin to realize that your team doesn’t have the skills they need. If you’ve identified a skills gap, it might be time to re-onboard or retrain your employees. What does it mean to retrain or re-onboard your employees? Retraining or re-onboarding is a way to get your team up to speed with the latest changes in your organization or industry. Unfortunately, employee orientation can be short or nonexistent for some employees. As employees work, they pick up on some things, but they may be learning inaccurate or incomplete information. Retraining helps you understand where your employees are so you can give them the skills they need to be successful in your industry. Instead of letting your employees continue to fall behind, companies who retrain help their staff members grow by teaching them what they need to know to be successful. When is it time to retrain your workers? Re-onboarding your employees is an expensive task. How do you know when it’s time to retrain them? Your employee has been with you for several years If your employees have been with you for several years without regular training, you must take the time to keep your employees educated. Professional development is crucial, so your workers should take the time to keep up, even if they’ve been with your company for a while. The best option with an employee who has tenure at your organization is to invest in yearly training. If employees get frequent training, they won’t need to rush to keep up every few years. You are moving to a completely new system If you are a franchisee, sometimes your organization has changes that you don’t have control over. If this has happened to your team, it’s time to retrain your team so they can learn the new systems/processes. For example, several companies have been adding new self-service machines to restaurants in the last few years. These new machines have changed the way that customers interact with employees. Employees had to learn to operate these systems and teach them to customers while grappling with how automation might affect their work. The industry has changed, and your employees need to keep up Industry changes aren’t frequent, but they happen. You can have a restaurant come to your area or a new law enacted in your city. These small changes can have a ripple effect on your business and require your employees to get retrained. An example of this has been COVID-19 restrictions that have changed restaurant operations. While many QSRs were deemed essential, they couldn’t have customers in the restaurant. This industry change impacted the way employees worked and served customers overnight. How to re-onboard your staff members Have you decided that your team can use some retraining, but you aren’t sure where to start? Here’s how to determine employee competency and make time for training as a QSR manager. Take a look at what they already know Before you decide to re-onboard your team, you need to understand what they already know. What transformation are you trying to achieve with your employees? Do they need to learn new software? Do you want to make sure they are up-to-date with recent customer service techniques? Try creating a quiz to test your employees on their current knowledge. Observe where employees pass or fail, then create a curriculum that meets your team members where they are. Alternatively, you can observe your employees in your restaurant. How do they handle customer service, compliance, communication, etc.? Monitoring employees as they work is a better way to understand where workers are if they aren’t great at taking tests. Create a curriculum that’s easy to digest between/during shifts One of the first ways you can re-onboard your staff is by using an easily digestible curriculum. Microlearning has become extremely popular for companies wanting to train their staff members. Instead of creating an extensive curriculum, you can slowly re-onboard or retrain your staff with quick articles, short videos, audio and quizzes. Microlearning takes more time, but it’s easy to fit in between and during shifts compared to traditional learning techniques. If you don’t have any significant retraining needs, you can use this technique. When using this technique, you give refreshers or minor updates to training. Pay for extra time with your employees to train during their off-time Most QSRs work in shifts. If you need to train your employees, you can offer overtime for employees to come in during their day off or time off to complete training with you. For example, you could offer a morning training session for employees who work at night and vice versa for morning workers. For employees who are off the training day, you can pay them to come in during one of your training sessions. The extra time approach can be a fantastic way to train all of your employees while giving their paychecks an extra boost that week. Pay for specific classes at a local college If you need employees with particular skills like management or accounting, you might decide to pay for a class or two at a local college. While this training isn’t QSR specific, it can significantly impact work. Employees who understand how to manage the store or balance books will make great leaders one day. There are a few downsides to using college as a training mechanism, though: You can’t control the curriculum. The courses are typically spread out over several weeks or a semester, and you have to accommodate that. College is generally expensive, even at a community college. On the other hand, there is a precedent for wanting more education in your restaurant as higher-level positions typically require a high school diploma or higher. Shut down your store for more profound training (if needed) While it’s not ideal, sometimes shutting down your store for an extended day of training makes more sense. For example, Starbucks shut down all their company-owned stores in May 2018 for racial bias training. It may be challenging for your organization to pay overtime or work on training in shifts. Closing the store for one day to do company-wide training makes sense if you’ve seen a large-scale need for retraining at your organization. Test your employees for knowledge after training After training your staff, you need to retest or reobserve your employees. Did they learn from the training? Is it impacting how they interact with your customers or their colleagues? You can also send a survey to your employees after training is over. Did they enjoy the training? What did they learn from it? This follow-up step is vital to ensure that the training you are running is sticking with employees. Conclusion: Get ready to re-onboard your team Are you excited to retrain your employees and prepare them for the future of QSRs? Re-onboarding employees isn’t tricky. You’ve just got to follow the necessary steps: Identify the need for re-onboarding Understand where your employees are Pick a training method that works for them Test your employees to make sure training knowledge has stuck with them With these simple steps, you can re-onboard any team member in your organization.

Today, the corporate world has moved from in-person traditional routes to more flexible and adjustable workplace options. Around 34% of private organizations offer their employees remote working or a hybrid version. Although remote operations provide several benefits, the remote onboarding process is much more complicated. Organizations were not used to hiring professionals when the trend first started. Despite the primarily accepted change in the industry, several organizations are facing complications with the onboarding process , which is entirely understandable. This article will share 8 great remote onboarding tips to make the onboarding experience easier for you. However, before we begin that, let's quickly go through some of the common challenges professionals face in remote onboarding . Challenges in Remote Onboarding Organizations have long faced issues with hiring new employees for their companies. These new hires can easily feel overwhelmed, out of place, or other complications without proper guidance. Moreover, the businesses may also face issue with the hiring if they are new to it. Therefore, we have listed some remote onboarding tips for you. Remember these challenges may vary from case to case, but we can categorize them into the following types, have a look: 1.     Virtual Communication Navigation Virtual communication may be highly effective for team members , but digital communications mean added backups. However, these backups can make virtual communication and navigation within the onboarding process more challenging. With proper data management, companies retention skyrockets after day one . 2.     Setting up the Technology With the digital onboarding done remotely, there’s more inclusion of technology, and lesser conventional working methods. However, setting up the technology for these processes may require more work for business owners. It can be particularly problematic for companies that are new to digital working methods and need the professionals or the hardware required for setting up a well-functioning remote hiring and onboarding system. 3.     Culture and Relationship Building Contrary to conventional workplaces, remote workplaces have more diversification before there are no geographical bounds for employees hired. However, culture and relationship building can also become pretty challenging for managers with a diverse groups (especially with a remote team ). The business owners may take longer to segment the employees and help them find coherence among each other. 4.     Avoiding Information Overload A remote onboarding program requires a lot of information processing, which can be significantly challenging for most companies. Anyone new to onboarding new employees remotely will make mistakes. However, these mistakes can prevent the professionals from losing potential employees and increase the onboarding process . 8 Great Remote Onboarding Tips: What you should consider As you probably understand by now, there are various issues you will face with the remote onboarding process . Business owners must understand these challenges and find solutions to them accordingly. The solutions to these problems may vary a bit for each organization. However, the generic concept remains the same. Our experts have outlined the best remote onboarding tips you should consider for your subsequent hiring. Let's begin: 1.     Focus on the Pre-Boarding The first and the most common mistake you will see professionals make is not choosing the proper pre-boarding method. It is the first step to an effective onboarding process and determines an organization's final experience with a new employee . People believe the pre-boarding process matters when the professionals hire conventionally, but it's just as crucial for remote onboarding . Instead of making the new employees spend time completing documentation, legal requirements, and other boring stuff, they can spend some time with the team. You can even use an online game as an icebreaker for new remote employees and help them interact. The faster a new team member gets to know the rest of the team, the quicker they can get to work. 2.     Create a Checklist for an employee's First Day The best way to make the new employees feel more welcome in the company is by letting them run their onboarding process . You can create a “getting started” checklist to complete when they first join. It can include requirements for the first week of working. It can also be the channels these employees need to join or the meetings they must attend. By giving them a charge, the professionals become more dedicated to their tasks assigned and take the initiative from the get-go. However, if you see them suffering, you can always lend them a hand with the process. 3.     Add Organized Onboarding Processes A common mistake most human resource professionals make is going with the flow. Improvising may be a good idea, but only in some things. We recommend being as organized as possible. Regular check-ins with new employees pay dividends. You can create a plan for the new employees for the first few weeks. It might seem like a lot of work, but you will use it for multiple employees in the future, so it’s worth the trouble. The more you prepare for an upcoming employee, the smoother the onboarding process will be, making you and your firm look professional. You can also add small notes, digital reminders, and a centralized server for these employees to make their professional journeys easier. Moreover, we also recommend taking feedback from the newly recruited employees after they complete a few weeks in the workplace. It will allow you to fine-tune possible issues that you may face with future employees. You can also ask the employees to report any issues they may face in the office otherwise. 4.     Be there and Ready As someone inducting the professionals in your company, you must make them feel welcome. No one wants to join a company remotely to be left alone. Instead, it would help if you walked them through each step of their setup, the team introductions, and other essential processes. With the remote working mode, you can easily do this with programs like Zoom or any other video conferencing platform. This way, you will ensure the professionals have a warm and structured welcome instead of feeling haphazard. Once you complete the remote employee onboarding , you'll ensure they are joined and understood. Additionally, the HR person in charge of onboarding must be present the entire time to review the processes and answer any new employee questions. If you guide them, (even if it is virtual), will make the employees feel more excited. 5.     Don’t Forego Your Company Culture A company's existing culture is a major driving force for its reputation in the industry. As the hiring authority, you should ensure the professionals see it as aptly as other day-to-day responsibilities. At the same time, companies should also learn to change and adjust their culture when hiring remote employees . As mentioned, digital hiring means having a larger employee spectrum, which might not fit well with your existing company culture . However, this should be a manageable element. Onboarding remote workers can be improved with the right approach. Some of the best ways to ensure the professionals are ready to work in your firm can be through: ·       Coaching ·       Mentoring ·       Technology ·       And a lot more With these simple steps, you can teach the new employees to understand and implement the approach better. Once you prioritize these things, your work culture will become stronger and so will the remote onboarding process ! 6.     Set up a New Employee with a Mentor Adjusting to a new workplace can be significantly challenging for new employees , even if they have prior working experience; if you wish your employees to adjust to the environment and job properly, with mentors that can keep a check on these newly onboarded professionals. However, the person you choose as a mentor for your employees matters a lot. You need to hire someone patient and willing to help the employees out. Chances are this new worker will make a mistake, which is where the mentor's guidance will come in handy. Similarly, these mentors can also provide the new-hired professional an opportunity to connect with other co-workers, giving them a sense of belonging in the workplace. 7.     Use Videos and Multimedia to share the Company Procedures. As a new professional in the workplace, an individual may not necessarily comprehend the processes right away. Instead, they require a much more interactive option. A great option in this regard is the video/visual SOPs. These new methods have greatly helped companies adopt new employees , streamline the remote onboarding process and smooth out everything else. However, you should know the type of employee you are hiring. For instance, some of these professionals may not be 100% remote (in the case of hybrid workers). With the dedicated videos, the new employees will feel much more welcomed and have a sense of belonging in the workplace. Moreover, it's great for hiring and onboarding new employees throughout the process. You can also use various employee video recordings to make the newly hired professionals feel more welcome. 8.     Create a Plan for the First Five Days of the Week People have commonly switched their jobs between 'The Great Lockdown' and there are a lot of different onboarding approaches these individuals have seen over the years. As an onboarding professional you should create a standard plan for these new employees for the first few days. Some of these include: Setting up their laptops and other digital devices Setting up a timetable and task timeline for them Creating virtual communications for them Introducing them to the overall culture and relationship building. Bottom Line Remote onboarding can be complicated, especially if you do not have the right skills, devices, and professionals ready to help you. As a hiring authority professional, it's your job to cater to these new workers and help them meet their goals as aptly as possible. We recommend following the tips outlined in this article, and you should have little to no problem hiring new employees remotely. You can always fine-tune this remote onboarding recommendation as per your business model.

Recruitment software is usually called an applicant tracking system, although core features must be present in recruiting software. As technology advances, organizations are leveraging the power of application systems and applications to streamline their human resource services. Getting the right software will positively impact your hiring strategy if you are a manager or business owner. It can increase access to qualified candidates and offer you opportunities for growth and expansion in business. Generally, recruitment software is broader and encompasses an applicant tracking system, including other tools that assist in specific hiring strategy sections. Workstream is one of the best software available in the market. If you are looking for a reliable recruitment software, there are core features that you must consider before subscribing or paying for the service. Core Features or Functionalities of the Best Recruitment Software The best recruiting software has the following functionalities included: Sourcing Ideal recruiting systems should allow management to source and attract the right candidates for different roles. So, the software comes in handy when identifying passive candidates who might otherwise not see the job advertisement in a company. Good recruitment software has inbuilt functions to highlight the core skills needed whenever there is an opening within a company. This allows timely reach out and acceleration of the hiring process because the right candidates are targeted. Engagement Recruitment application should also be able to engage with candidates, a basis for streamlining communication between recruiters and candidates. During the entire application process, candidates remain informed and updated about the core activities to be taken before being selected. Therefore, good software increases the hiring rate of an organization and minimizes costs and time involved for direct engagement when seeking to fill positions. Selection When choosing recruiting systems, always check and see whether it can automate functions that would otherwise require human interventions. So, choose software that can screen and select candidates based on their qualifications from the pool of applicants. The best recruitment tool will always allow you to automate numerous functions in the hiring process. As the human resource manager, you need a system that can sieve through thousands of resumes and applications to select the best candidates. So, the software should have artificial intelligence features to enable you to fulfill your mandate effectively. With AI capabilities, the software will assess and evaluate candidates and allow for easier collaboration between hiring managers and supervisors within the organization. With this approach, you will use software to hasten the hiring process and eliminate human dependency on selecting candidates. Hiring Another important feature or functionality of the best recruitment software is the ability to oversee and manage the actual hiring step. So, it acts as a basis for bridging the gap between a candidate's experience and employee experience. Some systems include onboarding features to ensure that hired individuals’ transition and integrate well into the company. Easing the transition process is one of the core benefits of using human resource applications. After screening and engaging with candidates, the recruiting system ensures that the right candidates are selected and eventually hired for the advertised jobs. So, the recruiting software is used to identify the right candidates and accelerate the entire hiring process in the organization. How the Best Recruitment Software Works Conventionally, recruitment software tracks candidates or applications throughout the interview and screening process. So, human resource managers and recruiters have an opportunity to create job postings, share them in social and web platforms, and view all relevant job applications through the software portal. After interviewing and screening the candidates, hiring managers can make updates within the portal. So, the system provides a central place for exchanging information between recruiters and managers. With this working module, the hiring process becomes more organized and efficient, offering individuals sufficient time to handle more important tasks. Recruitment software is a basis for creating candidate relationship management (CRM). It is better than applicant tracking software because it nurtures positive relationships with ideal candidates. While tracking software focuses on active job candidates, a CRM builds a pool of talent that can be considered for future job openings. You will enjoy several benefits during hiring if you get a human resource management system with these core functionalities. The best recruitment software will have the advantages outlined below. Benefits of Using a Recruitment Software As discussed, recruitment software is a real game changer in your organization. It allows you to manage all hiring process steps effectively and accurately.

This includes candidates' information, communication responses, scheduled interviews, and data about job opening performance on diverse platforms. Easy access from the central portal saves the manager's time in overseeing the process and ensuring that everything goes as planned. So, the best human resource software saves you time. Increases transparency of the hiring process With the best recruitment software, the transparency of your hiring process will increase significantly. Based on a report by PwC, more than 56% of candidates do not recommend an organization after a bad experience during the hiring process. Additionally, about 50% of candidates decline job offers after a bad experience with a client. As a company, you always want to hire the right candidates for your advertised positions. So, you want to rely on recruitment software to get insights and make the hiring process transparent and fair to all candidates. With CRM capabilities included in the software, you will build positive relationships and retain prospects for future jobs within the organization. Automation of communication, particularly emails, is vital in ensuring that candidates get prompt updates concerning their applications. Enhance your brand image When candidates have a good experience during the hiring process, they will recommend your company to other candidates. As a company, you always aim to have a positive brand image, whether among customers or prospective employees. So, having the right recruitment software will give candidates the best experience, which promotes positive testimonies across the internet. This includes social media reviews and comments on your blog posts and future openings. Simplifies the application process for candidates Good recruitment software simplifies the application process for candidates. This is crucial in providing a positive candidate experience. When candidates have positive experiences with a company, they will endorse the company no matter the outcome of their candidacy.

Share this article With the advent of technology, organizations are automating processes to maximize their potential. Tracking software is a system that tracks time, office location information, qualifications and skills levels, and other relevant data in human resource management. With these systems, managers can keep track of candidates and employees, allowing them to find the best fit for specific roles. The applications also provide a holistic environment for fulfilling different human resource roles. In human resources management, applicant tracking software creates a database for job applicants. Companies of all sizes use these systems to search, organize and communicate with massive groups of applicants. Many Fortune 500 firms use human resource tracking applications in their recruiting strategy. An applicant tracking system improves human resource management, optimizing productivity and growth. During the hiring process, there are tons of information and resumes to review before finding the right fit. There are several reasons why tracking software is essential to your business. The right system gives managers metrics to assess workers and identify skills gaps across the organization. Here are some reasons you should have human resource management tracking software. Tracking applications Business managers can optimize their recruitment process and get the right candidate faster using tracking software. The applications are programmed to evaluate resumes, find suitable candidates, schedule interviews, and store resumes in the cloud for easy accessibility. With these systems in place, hiring becomes easy and cheaper, with reduced costs of facilitating interviews and meetings for candidates. Automating manual tasks during the hiring process gives HR managers enough time to handle more critical aspects of candidate evaluation. An applicant tracking software seamlessly integrates email, website, and career board. The systems are accessible from multiple channels, including mobile and cloud platforms. Managers can collaborate with stakeholders across departments and provide progress reports to candidates and department heads. While applying for job openings, applicants must learn how to beat the applicant tracking system. The goal is to avoid automated rejections set on the software algorithms. Resumes and cover letters uploaded in the application form should follow a specific format for candidates to advance to subsequent application levels. Assist in employee onboarding Many businesses rely on onboarding checklists after hiring candidates. However, manual lists have a high tendency for mistakes and waste time. On the other hand, effective tracking software has an onboarding functionality, positively impacting the readiness and performance of new workers. New hires become productive within short timelines when the onboarding experience is solid and comprehensive. Effective onboarding exercise also boosts morale, improves engagement, and minimizes turnover rates. Tracking software allows for the seamless creation of onboarding programs within an organization. Since the onboarding process differs across organizations, getting an easy-to-customize tracking software is essential. There are many alternatives available in the market. As the HR manager, you should understand your organization's specific needs and choose a system that addresses these needs. While choosing the system, you should consider several crucial onboarding features. Candidates should also understand how to optimize their skills for applicant tracking software. The system should provide compliance techniques from the manager's endpoint. Other essential features for effective onboarding include an applicant's self-service option, the ability to customize workflows, access to multiple users, and electronic signatures and forms. Assists in employee education, training, and skill development Effective tracking software allows businesses to identify training needs, receive feedback, implement training programs, and evaluate the effectiveness of training procedures. A training and development interface system allow admins and supervisors to develop workers' skills quickly. Another benefit of tracking software is minimizing trainers' workload while giving executive managers a holistic view of the training process. Many HR tracking systems offer end-to-end automation with an accessible database. The tool also includes calendars, forms, folders, and other components enabling the pre-definition of workflows. With such systems, you can create a centralized training and development program at a minimal cost. Additionally, tracking performance metrics based on program outcomes will be easier for the organization. The features include having a manage-it-all functionality, allowing trainers, workers, and managers to operate from a single platform. A good tracking software should also provide schedule functionality, real-time feedback, assessment results, and strategy review capability. Assists in performance management across the organization In HR management, aligning employees to the business mission is vital. So, tracking software should allow managers to evaluate and manage workers' performance. Opting for a broader, progressive approach that includes setting objectives, implementing, evaluating, reviewing, and revising from a single interface is crucial. Workers will be happy and more loyal to the organization when the platform offers a structured and constructive technique. This is important in giving a business a competitive edge in the world. An efficient performance management platform accelerates growth for employees and the business. Good tracking software allows firms to define expectations and responsibilities, with clear procedures for coaching and feedback, which is a basis for evaluating workers' productivity. A sound tracking system also has a customizable performance evaluation outline that simplifies hiring managers' work. Other essential considerations have a holistic feedback system involving workers, managers, and peers. These aspects allow individuals to effectively understand their performance, time constraints, and resource gaps. Tracking software assists in managing workers Another benefit gained from tracking software is the ability to manage employees. HR managers can handle day-to-day tasks, such as scheduling shifts, predicting workloads, allocating duties to workers, and managing workloads. By effectively taking these aspects, managers will also have an elaborate space for getting data-based insights on all labour-related elements of the organization. The strategy is a basis for effective decision-making, enhancing business growth and development. A tracking software creates a seamless employee management system to enable businesses to move forward on many fronts. The approach also reduces costs by eliminating hiring people to oversee these aspects. A tracking software should come with five main components to manage workers effectively. These components include planning for resources, robust monitoring for employee directories, recording tasks, accessibility from any place, and the ability to report. Tracking and managing time Tracking software also acts as a time tracking system within the organization. So, it synchronizes the number of workers with the working hours as productivity metrics. This helps determine the amount of time needed to complete a specific task. It is the basis of creating a timesheet tracking, retrieving details, computing salaries, and recording working hours. Other tracking software allows third-party application integration to capture and analyze employee performance and project progress and export information into different formats. Businesses can utilize this data to understand skills gaps, identify hiring needs, streamline salary management, and get managerial insights. Do you need tracking software for your business? The tracking application you choose should offer various versatile and robust solutions to help you manage your brand. As a manager, it is essential to understand your needs. You will automate your entire HR process from hire to retirement with the right software. You will also be able to seal your performance and time management loopholes, optimizing your organization for growth.

From social distancing to the wearing of masks, our daily lives were considerably different, to say the least. This extended to the way employers hire new staff as well. With in-person interactions discouraged, employers had to turn to the digital space so that they could hire employees remotely. Now, over a year since the start of the pandemic, the digital transformation of the hiring scene is quite apparent. A Sage report found that 24% of businesses are currently using artificial intelligence (AI) to acquire talent and around 56% of hiring managers have plans to automate their hiring processes in the next year. Seeing how prevalent the use of technology is in recruitment presently, it is important for you, as a hiring manager, to keep up with the trends when hiring your hourly workers. After all, adopting such technologies will not only increase your hiring efficiency but also help you reach out to more job seekers. In this article, we’ll deep dive into some of the emerging technological features used in recruitment that can help make your hiring better and faster! 1. Videos As mentioned before, physical interactions were advised against while the pandemic was at its full peak. As a result, many employers turned to video conferencing platforms such as Skype and Zoom to conduct their interviews. While this may not exactly be the same as physical interviews, it does allow hiring managers to achieve the main objective of the interview - assessing whether a candidate is a right fit for the job position. Aside from that, companies are also inviting candidates to answer a series of questions before meeting them for a ‘live’ interview. This is to gauge their personality fit and ensure that they are evaluated based on standardized questions, minimizing any forms of bias during the selection process. 2. Smart Features Smart features such as AI and automations help to reduce the tedious tasks taken up by hiring managers. For example, Workstream’s smart screening feature uses AI to pick out the most suitable candidates based on the employers’ requirements. This also helps to reduce bias by using data, objectivity and predictive models. Not to mention, they no longer have to go through the resume of each and every applicant, thus significantly reducing the time spent on hiring. Automated features also hasten the process as the managers’ actions are no longer required for the application to move on to the next stage. Moreover, it allows them to focus on more important aspects of the job such as running their business itself. At Workstream, the automated scheduling function lets candidates choose their interview dates based on the managers’ availability. This helps reduce the back and forth that is usually expected when setting up an interview date using traditional methods. 3. Instant Messaging and Chatbots Instant messaging platforms have made it much easier for individuals to communicate with each other during their free time. Combine this with automations and you’ll create chatbots that are able to respond to your applicants more promptly. And given that the top frustration of job seekers is employers who do not respond swiftly, this feature will definitely make your hiring process better. Using this as part of your recruitment creates better engagement with your candidates and thus, increases the success rate of your hiring initiatives. 4. Applicant Tracking System Another technological feature that is widely being used by hiring managers now is the applicant tracking system (ATS). This organized hiring tool handles a business’ hiring needs electronically. It also makes it easier for managers to know where a candidate is at in their hiring stage so they know what their next course of action should be. Needless to say, having this feature saves a lot of time as managers no longer need to scramble around for information on a candidate since the ATS provides a holistic view of the hiring progress. Workstream also provides its clients with an ATS dashboard. The best part? The stages in their ATS can be tailored and automated based on the company’s needs. This all-in-one applicant dashboard has served many businesses such as Chicken Salad Chick who reported that their hiring became significantly more efficient after implementing Workstream’s ATS in their hiring strategy. 5. Third-party Integrations Lastly, the advancements in technology have made it possible for companies to integrate their hiring software with third-party services to expedite the recruitment process and improve their hiring strategy. This creates a seamless flow of hiring that makes the process more efficient than it was before. Workstream, for example, is integrated with over 25,000 job boards which allow their clients to cast a wider net while searching for suitable job candidates. Integrations with background check vendors and HR/payroll platforms are also possible, making employee onboarding a much smoother process. Summing Up The prevalence of technology in hiring was undoubtedly accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure that you’re not falling behind your competitors, adopting such hiring tools to boost your hiring efforts is imperative to the success of your business. What’s more, with the tight labor market the hourly worker industry is facing, these tools may become more of a necessity rather than an advantage to have over other companies. If you would like to utilize these features in your hiring, look no further. Apart from the technologies featured above, Workstream has a lot more to offer depending on the needs of your business.
