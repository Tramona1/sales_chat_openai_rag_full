The restaurant industry hasn't seen this level of upheaval since perhaps the dawn of fast food. The ongoing pandemic has been devastating to most business sectors, but food and hospitality has been especially hard hit. Despite all this, it's been inspiring to see some creative owners and chefs try new business models to adapt, and even thrive, during these trying times. One particular pain point has been the cost of reopening a restaurant in a pandemic . According to an in-depth article on Eater, restaurants have had to spend thousands of dollars just to reopen and restock after temporary closures. That's not to mention rehiring furloughed or laid-off staff, which adds to the expense, just to maybe reshutter due to new COVID spikes in certain cities. How can some locations avoid the cost of reopening and rehiring? Enter \" ghost food halls ,\" where several chefs and staff from neighboring restaurants will form a make-shift outdoor food hall. By joining forces with others in the community, they can share customers, defray costs, and band together, in general, to stay open, stay in business, and operate at a profit when foot traffic is almost non-existent. Another innovation that owners should consider? Non-refundable deposits for reservations. With public sentiment about dining out ever-shifting, reports out of the UK (where restaurants have not re-closed) show frequent patron no-shows . These empty seats are devastating to restaurants already struggle at 25-50% capacity. One potential solution is to implement deposits for reservations. Another could be to implement automated texts to confirm reservations; if they don't text back, it's canceled. No-shows are a problem that needs to be addressed ASAP when seating is at an all-time premium. The Takeaway: After September 11th, airports had to completely change their layout to accommodate the new safety guidelines. The restaurant industry is in a similar situation with an even more prevalent disaster. But those that take the opportunity to innovate will come out on top. Need help hiring the right people? Workstream can help.

In fact, very late. It's what people want - and it's where their money is going. In fact, a recent study found that the majority of people are willing to pay more for fast food sold in sustainable materials. Fast food restaurants, otherwise known as quick service restaurants (QSR), are now expected to be involved in sustainability efforts . #GoingGreen is now the only way to go. Here are 7 QSR brands that are leading the industry in their sustainability efforts : McDonald’s. As one of the biggest players in the business, any sustainability effort will have a significant impact on the environment. In 2018, they announced that they aim to reduce at least 36% emissions by 2030. Globally , its franchises are making a difference too. Singapore has five restaurants with the Building Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark Award which means that the building had a number of innovative energy and water saving features incorporated into the design. In Berlin , edible sauce holders were also tested to reduce waste. Subway. Over the last few years, Subway has ramped up its sustainability efforts. They source for their ingredients from environmentally friendly farmers . In 2019, they even announced a partnership with Cornell’s M.B.A. Program to tap into the innovative minds of the next generation of sustainability leaders to help further their commitment to reduce waste in the American restaurant network. KFC. Last January, they announced a new global sustainability commitment that all plastic-based, consumer-facing packaging will be recoverable or reusable by 2025. Restaurants in Singapore have stopped providing plastic straws and cup lids. They have also pledged to reduce the average energy consumed per restaurant energy and greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 10% by the end of 2025. Taco Bell. They made a commitment to make all its packaging compostable and recyclable by 2025. Meanwhile, they have pledged to continue to be the top fast food chain for vegetarians. For instance, a dedicated vegetarian menu with items certified by the American Vegetarian Association was launched nationally. In doing so, they also provide more options for meat eaters to consume and in turn promotes the decreased consumption of meat. Chick-fil-A. Late last year, Chick-fil-A launched its new sustainable bowls to hold their food. The usage of the new bowls will help Chick-fil-A reduce its national plastic use by 8.5 million lbs annually. Furthermore, the fast food chain is also involved in composting and transforming the way Chick-fil-A restaurants are built to make them more environmentally friendly. Starbucks. The global coffee chain has set a goal doubling its recycled content, as well as the compostability and reusability of their cups by 2022. In addition, they also pledged to eliminate plastic straws in their stores globally by 2020. More eco-conscious stores which are more energy and water efficient are being built around the world using responsible materials. Pizza Hut. In 2015, Pizza Hut was recognized by China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection for its commitment to reducing its environmental footprint and awarded the China Environmental Prize. The brand’s emphasis on sustainability is not just confined to China. In the UK, complete waste separation was implemented in Scotland to ensure that recyclable materials are not mixed up with non-recyclables.  In Mongolia, sustainable building design elements such as high-efficiency kitchen equipment.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 04/20/20 How Event Organizers can Adapt during the Pandemic Share this article Many businesses around the globe have been hit hard by the current crisis, particularly those that are heavily dependent on the physical presence of their customers. The restaurant industry has suffered an estimated loss of $225 billion while the hotel industry is expected to lose 4 million jobs . However, some companies have begun to pivot and adjust their business model to adopt new strategies and stay afloat through this tough period. For example, some restaurants have begun to focus on off-premise services like delivery and drive-thrus . Others have even started selling their packed meals at supermarkets . Some businesses can quickly pivot to source for alternative revenue streams due to the nature of their business -  those for whom the physical presence of their customers is not necessary for revenue generation. Others are not so lucky. Think concert promoters, wedding planners, and even coordinators of expos and conventions. In a nutshell, event organizers. These businesses are almost solely dependent on clients and guests being present at their events. How have such businesses been affected? And what have some of them done to adapt to the situation? Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on The Events Industry Cancellation after cancellation has rocked the industry. The NBA is expected to lose $500 million due to the cancellation of the games. Meanwhile,  a long list of music festivals and concerts have already been cancelled . The US concert industry is projected to lose $9 billion due to cancellations brought about by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. According to American punk rock band Against Me! lead singer Laura Jean Grace, it is almost impossible to push back touring or release schedules as these are planned years ahead of time. However, given how contagious the virus is, concerts, where people gather in huge masses, have no choice but to be cancelled. On the hiring front, many are losing their jobs. This includes hourly workers like janitors and security guards , as well as gig economy workers like wedding photographers . All of a sudden, they have lost their only source of income. The Show Must Go On While all event organizers share the same problem of being reliant on customers having to be physically present, these gatherings come in different forms. Some are still able to harness the power of technology to adapt to the pandemic. Realistically speaking, not all events can do so due to the nature of the event itself. Even without an audience physically present, the NBA still cannot function without players flouting social distancing rules and playing on the court. For those who have been able to, here’s how they’ve pulled it off. Professional Events These can include industry talks with an invited panel, or career networking events. You can utilize video and telecommunications apps such as Zoom, Google Hangouts, and Skype to host an introductory session where all attendees can join. Afterward, you can invite participants to join smaller breakout groups to listen to talks that they are most interested in. For example, a conference on hiring may invite speakers from various companies. During the introductory session, you can talk about general topics like overall trends and hiring insights. Following this, you can invite attendees to join the smaller breakout chat rooms, each with a keynote speaker talking about a specific HR topic. For instance, one room could host discussions about the hourly workforce. Inside the breakout room, you have Desmond Lim , CEO and Co-Founder of hiring software Workstream as a keynote speaker. Concerts Despite the cancellation of concerts, some celebrities and concert organizers have found another way to bring the concert to the homes of fans around the world instead of simply rescheduling them. For example, Elton John hosted the iHeart Living Room Concert which raised over $10 million dollars to fight the coronavirus. The star-studded show included big names such as Billie Eilish, Mariah Carey, and Alisha Keys. Meanwhile, the annual music festival Global Citizen has partnered with the World Health  Organization to hold the One World: Together At Home concert to celebrate healthcare workers around the world and support the UN’s COVID-19 Response Fund. Performances will be curated by Lady Gaga herself and will include the likes of Billie Eilish, Lizzo, and Stevie Wonder. At a time like this, perhaps concert organizers can think of alternative measures to bring the show straight into concertgoers’ homes. Graduation Ceremonies Social distancing means that mass gatherings of people are strictly prohibited - even for events that mark a significant milestone in life. However, some universities refuse to forgo this significant event in their students’ lives. The University of Pittsburgh, for example, will hold their first virtual graduation ceremony for over 8,000 graduates on April 26, Sunday. They’ll be hosting the 30-minute event on a dedicated website , and the ceremony will include special remarks from the Chancellor as well as from deans and alumni. What a way to end the graduates’ final year in the education system! With a bit of innovation and flexibility, businesses can find ways to keep themselves afloat throughout the economic crisis brought about by the pandemic.

One such client is Jamba. Steven Maltz is a muti-unit Jamba Franchise Operator and COO of Whirl Partners LLC. He previously held roles in the finance industry, where he was an Asset Management Manager at Essex Property Trust and an Equity Research Associate at Jefferies & Company. He is currently also an investor in Workstream . Lydia (L): What does your typical day look like as a COO? Steven (S): There is a lot more administrative work than most people would think. I won't go into all of it here but to name a few...as a business owner you are responsible for Human Resources, Payroll, Leases, Repair & Maintenance, Customer Service, Store Operations, etc. Generally speaking, a typical week consists of a mix of store visits with District Managers to ensure compliance to standards and the aforementioned administrative work. L: What is your process for getting feedback from your team? S: We have used surveys in the past however the best way to gain feedback is to have open and honest communication. To achieve this, it is important to drive the concept of accountability at all levels of the organization as it leads to greater trust and confidence to open dialogue. L: Do you have any advice for startups that are building products for hourly workers? S: If you haven't already, go work an hourly position in restaurants/retail to better understand the needs of workers and operators. L: Are there any trends that excite you? S: Technology in the retail and restaurant space. There are many companies currently looking to improve the operations and customer experience using technology and I am excited to see how it plays out. I believe we are on the fairly early end of tech in retail/restaurants. L: What's your typical interview process? S: What does customer service mean to you? That is a question I like to ask because after all any restaurant or retail business is really in the customer service business...they just happen to sell smoothies, burgers, coffee, etc. L: What do you, personally, look for in an applicant? S: Willingness to learn L: Given your experience in the field of hiring, w hat are common mistakes people make in the hiring process? S: In the interview process and on-boarding process, it is extremely important for Managers to set expectations from day one. Establishing expectations for behavior upfront is much easier than asking your team to change behavior after a month has gone by. L: What tools / services do you use to improve productivity? S: We use custom excel templates to run a lot of our internal processes and procedures. Additionally, we use scheduling tools and third-party payroll companies to help manage the Payroll and HR part of the business. For our hiring needs, we have used Indeed , Snagajob and Workstream . L: Do you have any books you recommend to people in your industry? S: My recommendation is to focus on staying current on industry news. You can learn a lot about the industry by reading about what is actually happening in the space. Also, it doesn't hurt to take a look at some of the public company 10-Ks and listen to earnings calls. L: How do you think restaurants will look in 10 years? What will be the biggest changes? S: More technology. More technology. More technology L: What quote / mantra inspires you? S: Love a quote by Howard Schultz - \"Success is not an entitlement; you have to earn it every day\" L: Do you have any advice for new restaurant owners/operators? S: If you are building a new store, ensure you do your due diligence on the real estate location. Additionally, look for a concept that has shown staying power, meaning they have been in business for a longer period of time (10+ years). Making a strong real estate decision with a brand that is reputable is a likely recipe for success. Also, don't underestimate the power of training your team and the importance of setting/maintaining standards.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/30/19 Tips to Cope with Hiring by the VP of Cain Management Share this article It's not an accident that the past seven years were the most successful years of Bob Anderson’s career. Bob Anderson is happily married to a beautiful, supportive and generous soul, and since he met his wife, her unwavering support has helped him take risks in his career, risks that he would never have taken otherwise. He became a husband and father at 18, and again at 22. Having kids at a young age, combined with his lack of education, forced him to focus heavily on his career. To get any sort of next level opportunity, Anderson had to be far above the competition. This has motivated him to be the first one in and the last one out most days at work. If anybody called in sick, he would offer to cover their shift. He had a family to support and as he was making minimum wage, every hour on the clock helped. As he got deeper into his career, that work ethic and \"education\" set him apart from the rest. Anderson wasn't always comfortable in his shirt and tie, because deep down, his corporate \"upbringing\" was sweatpants and boots. That made him relatable to most of his teams through the years. He used to be one of them – and if he could get here, then so could they. It gave him credibility that most of his peers didn't have, and is also why fourteen of the managers in his lead grew to the District manager level and beyond, and hundreds of stockers and cashiers become Assistant and Store managers. Q: What professional accomplishments are you most proud of since you are Vice President at Cain Management? Bob: What I'm most proud of in my tenure here was our ability to change the company's culture in a relatively short period of time. I replaced an absentee, hands-off leader who allowed the company's standards to fall. He had allowed his direct reports to abuse their power for their own personal gain. My hiring was met with much resistance, and once the current leadership team realized that the \"party was over,\" they arranged a mass-resignation, with all of the District Managers and around 25% of the store managers quitting on the same day. I had to lean on some of the very young relationships that I built, as well as reach in to my prior work relationships to form a new team. But this team was going to be different – we were going to be diverse, people-first leaders that delivered the same message, were passionate about driving results, and were loyal to the company. Watching the way they interact today at monthly meetings and different team events brings a sense of pride that's immeasurable! Q: What are the superpowers of your team? Bob: The team has developed a few different superpowers. They focus on finding solutions instead of dwelling on problems, they support each other even during intense competition, and they set aside what's better for them personally for the greater good of the team. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Build a power team with efficient onboarding and training ! Workstream’s mobile training allows you to send all onboarding materials (such as handbooks, checklists and training videos) via a text message link. Making the materials easily accessible to all employees anytime and anywhere instantly improves completion rates and motivation to read through these materials thoroughly. Furthermore, instantly review completion rates, and automatically send out SMS reminders to guarantee completion. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Bob: I like to think that I can morph into the leader I need to be, for any specific situation or team member. I try to be what everyone needs me to be, in order for them to be most successful. I try to be an open and honest communicator, that's hands on, reliable and dependable. Everyone usually knows where they stand with me. I'd rather hurt your feelings to make you better than avoid a tough conversation and watch you underachieve. Nobody benefits from that! Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Bob: There have been a few, usually self-inflicted. By far, the biggest obstacle has been my lack of education. I dropped out of high school at 15 years old, and it’s been an uphill climb ever since. I spent most of my 20’s and 30’s outperforming my peers by a wide margin, but found myself passed over for promotions by people who weren't as talented nor had anywhere near my results, just because they were more \"polished.\" It was very difficult to get beyond the District manager level despite winning many company-wide awards and being added to many training committees and advisory boards. Those experiences caused me to get jaded at times, and my attitude changed over the years. I became a little more selfish and a little less of the team player that I always was, which stunted my growth even further. I became desperate and obsessed with growing that I got away from the things that had made me successful in the past. Those were all valuable lessons that have helped me better mould and guide the careers of many of my top performers along the way. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Bob: Operating in NYC has presented very unique challenges that most of the country doesn't have to deal with. The outrageous minimum wage hikes over the past 3 years have caused us to change the way we hire altogether. Our stores have less staffing than ever, so people are asked to do more than before. The wage disparity between crew members and managers is minimal, so it's difficult to promote from within as compared to the past years. It's not worth it to many of them, to take on more responsibilities for a minimal increase. With around $1M per year being pumped in to mandatory minimum wage increases, there are less raises and benefits to go around for middle management. We're forced to find less-expensive options for most of the middle management positions, that really aren't as qualified and experienced as we'd like, then invest heavily in their training and development to get them up to par. Now more than ever, it's important to make your team love their job for reasons other than their pay. They need to feel included, heard and valued more than ever. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Source for experienced candidates, by posting across multiple job boards with Workstream’s job board integrations . By posting to 25,000 with one click, you’ll gain access to a large pool of candidates, putting you in front of much more experienced and relevant candidates too. Furthermore, smart sponsorship utilizes AI to optimize your job postings, granting you access to 10x as many job seekers. Thereafter, effectively filter out candidates that best fit your hiring criteria. Consider asking applicants to submit video resumes , to determine which candidates are the best fit to your team, and who will love what they do! Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience Bob: As a 15 year old high school drop out, you have no choice but to work from the bottom up! I was a stock boy that cleaned up bathrooms, tied large purchases to the roof of the cars, and swept and mopped the store most nights. When I got promoted to cashier, that was life changing! Soon thereafter I was able to get a spot as a hardware sales clerk, and eventually became a department manager. I got my first salaried job when I got promoted to Store Manager at 19 years old, and to this day it remains the biggest pay cut I've ever taken! When you're a top performing hourly associate, they'll throw all the hours at you, to your maximum capabilities. When you're a top performer and salaried, they'll throw even more hours at you because they don't have to pay you for it! My last year as an ASM, I averaged 75 hours per week, with 35 of those being OT hours. My first year as a salaried manager, I averaged 75 hours per week, with 35 of those hours being free. Jokes aside, I wouldn't trade any of those experiences for the world. Climbing the ladder and suffering setbacks along away created the path that lead me to this amazing position and lifestyle that I have now. There have been some great mentors along the way, and some daredevils who were willing to put their neck on the line for me, and for that, I'm forever grateful.

She grew up loving the outdoors, and was a swimmer from a young age through the beginning of high school. Kristen graduated from Arizona State University in 2001 with a BS in Sociology of work and organizational development. Some of her first positions were in Hospitality, where she built upon her interpersonal skills and learned to connect with and accommodate people in business. Kristen is an innovative leader with an intense entrepreneurial drive. She has a proven history of forging strong relationships and managing key multimillion-dollar accounts in the publishing and hospitality industries. She was previously also the owner of a small virtual administrative business, Delegate It!, in her late twenties & early thirties. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Kristen: Learning how to be patient. I think that there are some startups that have early success and are able to grow their teams and expand quickly, but not every business is that way. We had really humble beginnings and It's difficult not to compare yourself to those businesses moving along faster, wanting to be like them so bad, and batting off the naysayers. I have learnt to give myself a break and be patient in awaiting the success of my business. I am also learning to celebrate the small successes along with the big ones. Another challenge we had was undervaluing our service. It took us way too long to see that we are valuable, and that people were willing to pay our rates to make sure they were taken care of appropriately. Our clients are so appreciative of what we do for them, and almost always think we are worth every penny. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Work towards scaling your team quickly, by optimizing your hiring processes . Consider the use of text-to-apply posters, where custom posters can be printed for display at popular locations. Visitors can easily scan the QR code, or simply text the number displayed to view all open positions. Additionally, job board integrations will allow you to post to 25,000 job boards with a single click, saving time from copying and pasting to multiple job boards. AI can also be used to optimize your postings, maximizing your reach and putting your brand in front of 10x as many job seekers. Q: How you would describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? Kristen: Our company culture is impressive - our super power stems from the personality of our people. To work in this business, you have to have a personality that will jive with different ages, ethnicities, and situations. We work with the elderly, adults, children, fatally ill, collectors, young families with kids, animals, and the list goes on. We have a compassionate team that can understand someone's vulnerabilities, and comfort them in stressful times. We know when a client needs assurance, direction, encouragement, a laugh or a hug. It's priceless, in my eyes. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Kristen: I know that it is near impossible to find people who are as passionate and driven in your business as you are, but it has been a struggle to even find individuals with compassion, interpersonal skills and are driven to work hard. For that reason, has also been difficult to scale this business. We have a great team, but we had to weed through a lot of people to find that great fit. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Video resumes are a quick, and efficient way to weed through candidates, and determine who has the right personality traits for your team. It is also an easy way to find out which candidate is genuinely interested in the position. Make filtering through resumes a little less painful, while also securing candidates that exhibit certain traits you’re looking out for based on what was mentioned in that short video. You could also utilize smart screening , and automate scoring through multiple choice questions. Based on their answers, applicants will thereafter be filtered and only qualified candidates move forward to the interview. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Kristen: I have to admit I am a Type A personality mixed with a bit of OCD. However, I am reasonable about the expectations that I have. I know that nothing is ever perfect, and as long as you learn from a mistake, it isn't one. I am particular about everyone following our processes, it is the reason why we have been in business for nearly 7 years, with 0 insurance claims. I don't tolerate the mistreatment of anyone internally or externally. I am also light hearted, and a jokester. I like to have fun, reward people for their hard work, and take care of the most important part of our business, our clients. Q: Who inspires you and why? Kristen: Jesse Itzler – he is fearless in business and is a true entrepreneur who knows that there is never a perfect time to do anything, you just have to jump in and figure things out sometimes. He is very aware of his mortality and, in turn, makes the most of each day of his life. I love that he has an intention to balance his life. He plans his year ahead of time so he can travel, have fun and still accomplish all the things he needs to do. He really motivates me to be a better human. I am also a big fan of Will Smith, and love his style of looking fear in the eye and just conquering whatever scares him. I love his work ethic, his passion for life and his belief that you can do anything you put your mind to. My parents are also a huge inspiration. They are in their 70s - super healthy, excited for life and always planning their next trip. They started with nothing, worked really hard and raised my sister and I. They have lost a daughter (my sister) in recent years, but really worked through it and figured out a way to still make the most of their life. Their strength is awe-inspiring and they have been amazing role models for me. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Kristen: Oh Yeah… I started working when I was 14 years old at the local pool, making $4.25 an hour. I worked at Subway in High School, for a construction company. I put myself through college working administrative jobs at restaurants, andeven cleaned my bosses house every other Friday to make extra money. I wasn't raised to be afraid of work. I enjoy it. You have to start somewhere and with each step you learn. I have had positive experiences at even the worst jobs, and I always make a point to take stock of all I have learned, what I like and don't like about those jobs to better shape what I want in my future.

Mark had just relocated his family to Orlando to be the General Manager of the I Drive location, and Paul was his bar manager. From the very start, they were already more like brothers than friends. Days off, vacations, and days on the boat, both families eventually grew close too, and their kids grew up together. They both talked about starting their own restaurant. Mark relocated to Las Vegas in 2007, but they stayed in touch. They could go months without talking, but then when they did it was as if no time passed, with them picking up where they left off. Mark and Paul still went on vacations in Orlando, and the pair continued to talk of starting something of “their own”. This plan was eventually realized when Mark got a text from Paul in August 2016 – he had quit his job. At this point, Mark was overseeing 5 restaurants (each) in Las Vegas and LA. Paul flew to LA, where Mark introduced him to his favorite restaurants, some of which he enjoyed, and others where he didn’t. When the food fest was done, they went on a road trip back to Vegas while discussing the concept of their soon-to-be restaurant. They came up with three things: incredible food, remarkable service, and something that was easy to replicate. This led to the birth of the Island Fin Poke Company ! Mark's Las Vegas kitchen became the starting point of their poke. Friends and family gathered to taste test sauces. Over the course of a few months, their homemade sauces were finally created - fresh, delicious, and all gluten free. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Mark: The biggest challenge is always people. When I started my career, the world was very different. I was a kitchen manager and I made Gordon Ramsay look like a teddy bear. I remember my 30th birthday like it was yesterday. My director came into my restaurant and handed me a gift. It was the book \"Brutal Bosses\". I have never read the book. Just the fact that he cared enough to give it to me impacted me immensely. He changed my life and reshaped my career. From that point, I realized that time should be spent coaching and being a teacher, rather than a brutal boss. It is amazing how much further you can get when you treat the team with respect. That doesn't mean there isn't accountability, there’s always a give and take, and the standards must still be met. Q: How you would describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? Mark: The company culture here at Island Fin Poke Company is a culture of family. We have a huge graphic on the wall that says \"Ohana, no friends just family\" and we live by that. Family meals, closed holidays for family time, and always being welcoming to everyone. I think the real superpower of the team is the ability for each and every team member to take the service mentality. The team engages the guest throughout their entire experience. No matter how big we get, we want to remain a neighborhood joint. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Mark: The best thing about our concept is that for new hires, this is often their first job. Our concept is super simple and easy to execute. We pay well and the kids genuinely love their jobs and the money they make. We don't need to hire experienced and jaded long time restaurant people. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Reach the new hires you need, through job board integrations – save time on copying and pasting to multiple job boards, and post to 25,000 job boards in one click. Additionally, these job postings will also be optimized by AI, putting your brand in front of 10x as many job seekers. Consider the use of text-to-apply posters, that allow visitors to scan the QR code or text the number displayed. Since people are mostly on their phones these days, make it convenient for them to apply, which will increase the number of applicants. Additionally, they will get a link to all open positions, allowing them to browse through different job listings based on their preference. Q: Who inspires you and why? Mark: The greatest thing about this business is watching the team grow. I never wanted to be a teacher at all, but honestly the most important aspect of this job, especially in the growth mode we are in, is the education of the team. When we have the team trained properly to execute the concept, the guest experience is through the roof. The comments, the reviews, the reaction on our social media just gets me fired up. There are so many other options out there for the guest to spend their money on, and our job is to make them choose us. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Create the best guest experience by putting all employees through a standardized training program. Consider mobile training , where you may send handbooks, checklists, and training videos to your employees, so that these materials can be accessed anytime, anywhere. Hiring managers will also be able to instantly review completion rates, with SMS reminders that guarantee completion. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Mark: Unfortunately, I am a perfectionist. It is tough in the restaurant business. but I see no reason why we should not strive to be perfect every day, every shift and for every guest. I am very hands-on - when I’m in one of our restaurants, I am very involved from prep to service to the overall guest experience. I like to be close to where the rubber meets the road. I like to hear from the guests and the team, to find out how we’re doing. We are in the position we are in to serve people. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: With a streamlined feed , stay on top of what’s going on in your business. All applicants' and current employees' data are within the same dashboard and mobile app, regardless of their location. Review and recommend candidates, or customize workflows for each job post to create a seamless hiring experience. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Mark: Heck yes. My first job was as a dishwasher at an Elias Brothers Big Boy in Cascade Michigan. I loved working and the independence having my own money gave me. I worked hard and in 30 days was promoted to cook. I was the youngest person this franchise had ever promoted to cook. It was awesome. I was super lucky, my mom would let me work as much as I wanted as long as my grades were good. That also made my boss happy. My kids both work at Island Fin and I am tough on them. My 18 year old basically runs the place. Sysco orders, payroll, everything. I love it! Hoping to create a power team that can provide a great customer experience?

But, as a restaurant owner or manager, you have to regularly do tasks just like those for your restaurant to succeed. And a good restaurant employee evaluation form can help you simplify the process! But if you don’t already have a go-to employee evaluation form or know how to use one, we’re here to help. In this article, we’ll be showing you: The benefits of an evaluation form for you and your employees How to effectively use a restaurant employee performance evaluation form Next steps and common scenarios following performance reviews How to create a template restaurant employee evaluation form But let’s begin by briefly discussing… What is a restaurant employee evaluation form? A restaurant employee evaluation form is a restaurant management tool used to assess an employee’s work performance. It’s a document that can help restaurant managers identify employees’ strengths and areas for improvement. The form consists of different sections to evaluate important employee attributes, such as communication skills and work ethic. And it’s usually used during performance reviews to give you and your employees an opportunity to reflect on their past performance. Why use an employee evaluation form? Restaurant employees are always on the go during business hours. So, it can be challenging to track their performance without proper documentation. A well-structured restaurant employee performance evaluation form (like the one we’ll show you how to create in just a moment) will help you quantify and measure your employee’s performance and progress over time. More importantly, it simplifies your restaurant employee management processes by making it easier to do the following three things. Ensure employees are on the same page An evaluation form can help align expectations between supervisors and staff. Because the form lays out the employee’s performance objectively, it allows you to discuss problem areas without the employee feeling like they are being called out. Provide an objective record of an employee’s performance Often, unintentional bias and prejudice affect our decision-making. This is normal and happens to everyone. And a standard evaluation form can help us make objective decisions on things like whether an employee gets promoted or laid off. Keep employees engaged An employee evaluation form also allows employees to reflect on their past performance and identify ways they believe they can improve. They can also use the evaluation form as a tool to develop a personalized career plan and keep record of their progress at work. How to conduct a performance review using an employee evaluation form Now that you know how an evaluation form can help you and your employees, here are some tips on how to use one effectively before, during and after performance reviews. Introduce the form Introduce the form to your employees early, preferably during the onboarding process when they are hired. Give them a blank evaluation form and explain how it works in your employee performance review process. This will help them become familiar with your workplace success factors. Explain the importance Tell the employees why your restaurant uses employee evaluation forms. Emphasize that it’s not to criticize or punish them, but to track progress, give recommendations for improvement, and make impartial decisions for things like promotions and raises. Schedule performance reviews Given how busy running a restaurant can be, it’s best to schedule performance reviews with your employees at least two weeks in advance. This will give everyone time to reflect on performance, progress and goals before the review. Ask employees for self-evaluation Ask your employee to fill in the employee section of the form before the performance review. That way, they can share their thoughts during the meeting as well. Employees that do self-evaluation are more likely to hold themselves accountable for past issues and develop realistic plans to improve. Evaluate employee performance Next, it’s your turn as the restaurant owner or manager to evaluate your staff. Keep the evaluation objective and support it with quantifiable metrics. When possible, also try to include examples and advice to help the employee grow professionally. Share the evaluation form Once the form is ready, share it with the employee. Do this before the performance review to give them some time to read through comments and process the information. Review employee evaluation forms Now it’s time to discuss everything on the form with your employees. During the meeting, explain the reasoning behind your scores and feedback. Be ready to answer questions so you can clear up any doubts and resolve potential issues. Encourage individual professional development plans Lastly, outline next steps with the employee. Help them develop a personalized professional development plan. And identify steps the employee can take to learn new skills and achieve relevant goals in the coming quarter or year. What to do after the performance review After performance reviews are over, use the information you and your employees have documented on the forms to make important decisions or set new expectations. Here are some examples of best and worst case scenarios. Best case scenarios Promotion and raise. If an employee did an exceptionally good job, consider rewarding them with a promotion or raise to encourage them to keep up the good work. Encourage improvement. If an employee sets improvement goals during the performance review and you later see them making progress on those goals, recognize and praise them for their effort. Fix recurring issues. If several employees mention the same workplace issues during performance reviews, look into those problems and try to resolve them. Worst case scenarios Constructive feedback. If your employee is consistently performing poorly, provide clear, constructive feedback on what they can do differently and set milestones to track progress. Termination. If you notice continuous problems that aren’t improving after several performance reviews, you may need to fire the employee . Resignation. If an employee indicates indifference or extreme frustration during the performance review, it might be a sign they’re thinking about quitting. Restaurant employee evaluation form template Now that you know how to conduct a performance review using an employee review form, it’s time to create one for your restaurant. Here’s all of the information you’ll want to include on your restaurant employee evaluation template. Employee information To start, the form should include basic employee information, such as: Name Date of hire Current position Evaluator’s name Performance review date Evaluation categories There are many different metrics you can use to evaluate restaurant employees’ work performance. And the metrics you use to evaluate a server won’t be the same as your head chef. But some evaluation categories apply to all restaurant staff, such as: General work habits Teamwork skills Communication skills Professional development Grading system A consistent and transparent grading system will help you objectively evaluate your employees’ performance. You can use letter grades (A-F) or a number scale (1-5). The definition of each letter or number should be clearly explained in the form and before the evaluation so your employees understand where they stand. For example, the letter “A” or the number “5” usually means “exceptional work” in a particular evaluation category. Remember to provide space for employees to also evaluate their performance using the same grading system and metrics. Review previous goals and feedback Include a section where you can refer to evaluation scores from previous performance reviews. You can also choose to just attach the previous forms. Either way, previous evaluation scores will be useful to compare and determine how much an employee has improved since the last performance review. Evidence The evaluation should be just and objective. Backing up your score and feedback with proof will make your evaluation and recommendations more convincing. For example, you may reference attendance sheets, POS reports and/or customer reviews. Signature Last but not least, both the supervisor and employee should sign the evaluation form to indicate that they’ve reviewed it together. Final thoughts The restaurant industry is one of the most competitive industries in the world. And, to truly succeed, you need restaurant employees that are committed to growing with you! Use the employee evaluation form template that we’ve shared today to track your employees’ progress, make objective restaurant management decisions and ensure employees know how to best contribute to your restaurant goals .

They could be missing their performance targets, display unsatisfactory behavior or have poor relationships with their teammates. If that happens, you may need to bring a performance improvement plan into the equation. Having a performance improvement plan can guide your employee back on track. But what exactly is a performance improvement plan, and how should you go about it? Here are some tips on how to create a performance improvement plan and how to follow through with it in a way that’s healthy and beneficial for all parties involved. What exactly is a performance improvement plan? When your employee is underperforming, it could result in frustration, unhappiness and discord between team members. These are some negative effects that could escalate in the long run, effectively lowering morale and productivity. Having a performance review gives them a second chance to correct their mistakes, and for you to rediscover their potential. This review brings up their missteps, provides them with a second chance to improve their performance and lays out your expectations. (It also saves you from the difficult decision of letting the employee and the hassle and additional costs of hiring and re-training another one.) Ultimately, it's the best way to provide positive encouragement to employees, highlighting areas where they can improve, so that they can develop new skills and have goals to work towards to get better at their job. How to create a performance improvement plan? There are several key components to a meaningful performance improvement plan. Here’s how to design yours. 1. Set clear goals This is where you list the expectations and goals that your employee should work towards. This should be specific and clear so both you and your employee are on the same page. Goals should be attainable and incremental so the employee can reasonably reach milestones to demonstrate their commitment and realigned focus. (Plus, it helps them gain momentum and keeps them excited about their job.) When you set goals, remember to include a timeline, with a specific start and finish date and checkpoints (if applicable). This helps add structure to the goals, and keeps expectations aligned for both parties. 2. Foster two-way conversations Set up a meeting and have a conversation with the underperforming employee. This meeting will create a space for you to find the root cause(s) behind why the employee isn’t reaching their current goals. Perhaps they're facing a situation at home, or they’re having difficulties adapting to their role. By understanding and looking at their performance with this additional context in mind, you can be more empathetic of their situation and potentially discover new ways to help the employee get back on track. For example, if your employee is underperforming because they’re having difficulties adapting to their role, you may consider assigning them a mentor that they can turn to for guidance rather than letting them suffer in silence. Ask them about what they think about their job and the new goals that are set. Ultimately, this should be a conversation between both parties, rather than them following the goals you've set. This will help manage expectations on both sides, especially if the hourly employee is overwhelmed by their workload. And lastly, give them an opportunity to give feedback or state their opinion. This is a critical piece of finding true alignment and will be extremely useful in setting up the performance improvement plan more effectively. 3. Provide guidance and positivity Be sure to talk with your employee about what they've done well, too. This is important. While they may have underperformed in a certain area, they may have also excelled in other aspects of their job. Bringing this up will help them feel valued and motivate them to do better. As a leader, it’s your responsibility to provide your employee with all the necessary resources they’ll need to reach their goals. Be mindful of those needs and provide them in a timely manner. 4. Set up a check-in schedule Consistency is key, and what better way to do it than through routine meetings to discuss progress? Set up weekly or monthly check-in to see how your employee is doing. Use this time to see if they’re getting closer to being on track or if they’re facing any roadblocks you can help them overcome. 5. State the consequences Your hourly employee needs to be aware that continued underperformance will yield consequences—and let them know exactly what those consequences are. List them clearly in your plan, but keep the focus and emphasis on improvement, not punishment. If you don’t, your employee may read this as a sign that they may be let go when your real intention is to help them become better in their role. Remember, welcome open conversation during these moments. Your employees should feel comfortable enough to bring up any concerns they have along the way. 6. Create the actual performance improvement plan Now that you know these elements, it’s time to begin writing. Unsure of how to go about it? We've created a performance improvement plan template to make things easier for you! For a detailed example of the content you can include in the performance improvement plan, refer to our template here. How to sustain your performance improvement plan? Now that you've put the performance improvement plan in place, how do you ensure that your hourly employee adheres to it and that their progress is on track? This is where the regular check-ins with your employee come into play. Again, these meetings can range from weekly to monthly sessions to follow up on their goals and determine if they're on the right track—whatever will set the employee up for success. These check-ins can also be coupled with extra support or training to help the employee bridge the gap between the skills they have and the skills they need. Training may take shape in a variety of forms—including video courses or job shadowing . Review the performance improvement plan from time to time to ensure that everything is on track. If the employee is showing drastic improvements, it may be a signal that the goals can be tweaked to a more advanced level. Likewise, if they seem to be struggling with the objectives set previously, consider reducing the criteria. This is where you can ask questions, and determine the effectiveness of the performance improvement plan. Did it help? What do they think should be the next steps? As your employee reaches their goals, reward them! This doesn't have to be monetary in nature. Even complimenting them on their improvement is a great way to show that their efforts didn’t go unnoticed or unappreciated. You may also consider some of these top benefits that can help in incentivizing employees. TAGS Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter 04/14/22 The powerful (and unusual) partnership between Ops and HR Share this article The dynamic duo of Operations and HR is an unusual pairing in the QSR space. But Apollo Joulios and Kayla Ladd (both of Wowza/Whirld Concepts, a Jamba and Cinnabon franchisee) are proving that this team can be a powerful one—using their distinct domains to more than double the company’s size and scale largely from within. Their origin stories are quite different, however. Apollo got his start at Jamba in high school, at the same time his father, Panos, came in to train as a manager. Apollo left Jamba to go to college on a different track, while Panos eventually became a franchisee in California. Meanwhile, Kayla had been doing some HR work on the side for a franchisee in Arizona. That franchisee was in the process of closing stores, not opening them. So Kayla was on her way out of the industry when Panos approached her about coming on board as his operator when he expanded into her state. He also invited Apollo back into the fold as Director of Operations, and bam!—Wowza/Whirld Concepts took off. They now have 41 stores and counting, with more than 700 employees during peak season. This growth, while exceptional, is not unique. But what sets their organization apart is the dedicated growth of both the HR and the Operations functions as distinct, related functions. Kayla, in fact, is now the HR Manager for Wowza/Whirld, a job that did not exist until she identified opportunities for the company to double down on building out human resources into what it is today. In this interview, we talk with Apollo and Kayla about how (and why) they grew out a dedicated HR function, how this evolution empowered company-wide opportunities for growth, how their extreme operational transparency between functions (and throughout the organization) enables them to scale quickly and sustainably, and where leaders can begin to develop similar strategies for their own teams. Spinning out a dedicated HR org When Kayla came on board as an operator for Wowza/Whirld, the company was growing so quickly that she found herself handling most HR issues while also being its only operations leader in the state of Arizona. And that didn’t change once they started adding district managers—they all had HR functions under their umbrellas, and Kayla still did too. “We all knew what was coming,” she says. “We needed to have a dedicated HR department to handle the needs of the business, to support the continued growth efforts of our business and to make sure that our people were at the center of that growth.” Kayla easily took on so many HR functions because she had a solid team of district managers and store managers to handle the operations side of things. But she recognized that other operations managers might not be so fortunate—so she, along with Apollo, undertook the conscientious process of creating a distinct HR program alongside Ops. In that process, they learned these key lessons: You’re building up Ops at the same time you’re building up HR. When splitting off an Operations leader to become an HR leader, you want to make sure that Ops is still being taken care of. That means training upper-level replacements for whoever, like Kayla, is making the transition Communicate policies and procedures to the company. Kayla flags this as a big deal, and it keeps HR from being insular within the organization. Even though HR might now oversee recruiting, hiring, onboarding and training, streamlining those processes and implementing them across locations and districts is crucial to maintaining consistency. Recruit for the managerial ranks—and recruit from within. For Ops to stand distinct from HR, it needs strong leadership at both the store and regional levels. So early on, Kayla and Apollo recruited heavily for strong store managers and assistant managers—and as they grew, they recruited from those ranks for district managers. “We were lucky enough to grow from within,” Kayla says. “All but one of our current DMs has worked for Jamba at a team member level. That’s very helpful.” Creating company-wide opportunities with the Ops and HR dynamic One of the higher-level reasons Wowza/Whirld decided to spin HR off from Ops was that, with the company portfolio multiplying so rapidly, they identified the opportunity and the benefit of creating company-wide initiatives on both sides. When HR was folded into Ops at all levels, each manager largely had to create and implement these initiatives themselves. With dedicated functions, those programs can become more efficiently centralized. “I’d had so many ideas, just coming from an operations standpoint, where we could improve as a company,” Kayla says. “We were doing so many great things and I wanted the ability to share those great things with the company as a whole, as opposed to them just being at a store level or maybe a district level. Creating opportunities at a more company-wide level, as opposed to an individual store level, was a huge benefit.” Apollo loves having a separate HR branch to collaborate with because of the structure it provides to the organization as it scales—which in turn helps the organization improve the environment for its people. After all, operations and the people function go hand-in-hand: you can’t operate, and you can’t grow, without your people. “We are so big that having that many employees just takes up so much time,” he says. “And we’re not going to slow down. Our goal is to keep adding on. The efficiency of this collaboration of minds, identifying needs and coming up with fresh new ideas has been great.” Scaling from within by being transparent One of the dangers of splitting off these functions is that HR and Ops become siloed. (Perhaps this is why so many QSR companies operate without distinguishing these functions!) So Wowza/Whirld operates with extreme operational transparency—not only between these functions, but between the parent organization and individual store teams. “From the team member to the GM, to our DMs, we’re transparent with our timelines, with our expectations, with financials,” Apollo explains. “We want them to run their districts and stores as if they own them. The only way to do that is to be transparent, show them where every dollar goes, show them where the people go.” For Wowza/Whirld, this transparency takes the form of monthly calls with DMs to go through profit and loss statements and succession planning on the Ops side, plus training and development updates, company policies, and health and wellness programs on the HR side. Then the DMs have subsequent sit-downs with their GMs and AGMs, and some of that information makes it all the way to hourly team members. This level of transparency is not typical for managers in the industry—many companies share more on a need-to-know basis, with more need-to-know the higher up the ladder a manager climbs. A typical managerial track might start with learning about cost of goods sold and hitting certain benchmarks. But a new manager doesn’t understand all the context behind the decisions they have to make. And as they move up, they slowly pick up more knowledge. But the Wowza/Whirld model of transparency offers a stronger sense of understanding right from the get-go. “If you don’t share what goes into the business and you don’t educate the teams, they won’t really understand,” Apollo says. “If we don't teach that at an early stage, we won't be a successful business.” Getting comfy with extreme transparency A lot of leaders may balk at the idea of being quite so transparent the whole way down the chain. But Apollo and Kayla see this extreme clarity as an essential component of their build-leadership-from-within approach. “Knowledge is power,” Kayla says. “We definitely want to empower our store leaders to own their business, and they can't do that if they don't know what's going in and what's coming out of their stores.” Apollo expounds on this idea: “There's the things that you can control and the things that you can't,” he says. “We really like to focus on what you can control. So, labor and COGS and what you spend. What are you spending on office supplies? What are you spending on uniforms? And at the end of each month, it's neat to see the trickle down from when we share with the DMs, and then they share with their teams. It’s eye-opening, especially with the newer GMs and AGMs, who are like, ‘Oh my gosh, I just didn't know that paper cost this much.’” Even leaders who are comfortable with sharing financials with managers might get squeamish about talking money with hourly team members. Apollo talks about GMs who have put price tags on each piece of equipment in a store to show the team how much, say, an orange juicer costs—opening the team members’ eyes and making them better stewards of the company’s assets. Of course, their company is not simply throwing numbers at DMs and team members and expecting the understanding to come. One of the strengths of the distinct HR org is that Kayla’s team oversees trainings for understanding different facets of the financials—giving managers better context into the information, and easing the hesitancy some leaders might feel about sharing this information so transparently. “We train our DMs first to feel comfortable with digging into their P&Ls, and then encourage them to spend time training their GMs and AGMs during their monthly one-on-ones,” Kayla explains. “And it takes years for them to fully grasp a P&L, because it can be very complex. It’s daunting to look at. So we include a lot of training.” Final thoughts: It takes the right people The Wowza/Whirld model works: the organization has more than doubled in size by any metric. But all the efficiency behind strengthening both HR and Ops functions—and all the brilliance behind extreme transparency—won’t amount to much without a certain human element. So if there’s one place to get started in unlocking your operational efficiency, it’s this: Believe in your brand. Then, find other people who believe in it too. “It starts with our people,” Kayla says. “I have seen resumes four pages long with experience in the restaurant industry. The person can have as much experience and knowledge as we want, but if they are not bought into our ideals, our mission, our brand, what we try to do every day, it’s just not going to work. They won't be happy. They're not going to be successful, and they’re not going to be a long-term solution.” Apollo concurs. “You have to believe in the brand, you have to believe in who you work for and you have to believe in your teams,” he says. “Nothing will get done unless there's that buy-in from everyone. This comes with the transparency piece. I mean, we wouldn’t even be here right now if Kayla hadn’t gotten transparency with our roadmap years back. That has led to us being transparent with the rest of the teams. And we’re all here because we absolutely love the brand and we believe in what we do.” TAGS Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

She began her foodservice career as a teenage waitress at Hooters, worked her way up to vice president by her mid-twenties and has taken on a series of C-suite positions, transforming companies such as Cinnabon along the way. It might be easy to chalk up her success to incredible good fortune, or a by-the-bootstraps work ethic. Neither one would be wrong, but that’s not the full story. Rather, Kat attributes the entirety of her success to three simple drivers she’s used, one way or another, since day one: be helpful, get creative and look after yourself. That formula has worked well for her: after leaving Hooters, she became the president of Cinnabon and turned that business around out of the recession, launching its well-known multi-channel division and extending the brand beyond its legacy channel into CPG, wholesale and other types of retail. She then became president and COO of Focus Brands, which develops global multi-channel food service brands as well as franchising and operating more than 6,300 restaurants, including Jamba, Auntie Anne’s, McAlister’s Deli and others in addition to Cinnabon. Then, after a year spent helping other people build their businesses, she fell in love with the fastest-growing nutrition company in the US and became the president and COO of Athletic Greens. In this interview, we asked Kat to dig into how she took a chance on herself as an entry-level waitress, and how she turned these three drivers into the diverse and successful career she’s enjoyed so far. First driver: Be helpful When she started as a waitress, Kat could have stuck to her job description and achieved perfectly exemplary results. But she decided to find a way to do more—which she says typically means finding a way to help out other people—and that elevated her quickly to the point of opening new stores internationally. “Helping others is just a good foundational practice,” she says. “I didn’t set out to build a restaurant resume that would make me a great candidate to be a new store opener. I just really wanted to help.” Kat learned to work every role in a Hooters restaurant out of pure natural need. When cooks quit, she went to work in the kitchen. When the bartender needed to pick up her kid early, Kat became a bartender. When the manager needed help, she jumped in. She recalls the aphorism about doing the job before you get the job. She wasn’t satisfied by doing a great job as a waitress; so what if she wasn’t technically a cook, or a bartender, or a manager? The jobs needed to be done, and she did them. By the time she was 19, she was working every job in the restaurant and had become uniquely suited to teach new Hooters employees around the world. So the company invited her to join the training team as part of its international expansion. Her first store opening took place in Australia. Two months later, she was helping to open the first Hooters restaurants in Central America. Soon, she was not just a member of the training team—she was leading the openings herself. A year later, she took a corporate job running the employee training department. By the time she was 26, she was one of the vice presidents, and Hooters was doing about $800 million in annual revenue. All because, back when she first started waiting tables, she was willing to assist wherever her restaurant team needed it. That helping-out mentality continued to serve Kat as she grew into more executive roles. “Most of the roles I have had in the last twelve years did not exist before I took them,” she says. “The companies were growing and evolving and changing. So I couldn’t have possibly envisioned myself in exactly that role.” Second driver: Get curious It wasn’t enough that Kat was game to help out in any role. She also had to get curious about how those roles worked. “I was super curious,” she says. “When the cooks quit and I went back in the kitchen, it was really about, ‘Can I do it? Do I know enough to do it well?’ I didn’t put pressure on myself to be perfect. It was more like, whatever I do is better than zero.” Kat offers her perspectives on how she took this curiosity-driven approach to expand her skills. Reframe risk as learning “I was lucky that I came from such humble beginnings,” Kat says. “I didn’t have much to lose.” So she never operated from the standpoint of What happens if I mess up? “I was more afraid of what would happen if someone else did those things, or what would happen if I didn’t say yes,” she says. So she repositions failure as F-A-I-L: first attempt in learning , to destigmatize the natural bumps that come along with saying yes to something before you’re completely ready for it. Besides, what was the worst that could happen if she didn’t do a great job the first time? With no cooks in the kitchen, customers already weren’t getting their food—so she figured even if it took a little longer for her to make their meals, that was at least preferable to getting no food at all. Asking questions shows strength Some people look at Kat’s career trajectory and see all the risks she took. She looks at it and sees all the questions she had to ask. And she understands that asking questions can be vulnerable—which some people experience as “weak” or “showing a lack of confidence.” “If you think about it,” Kat says, “you’ve got to be pretty comfortable in your own skin to ask for help. There’s actually implied confidence to the person asking the questions.” So she was relentless in asking for help—not as a damsel-in-distress, looking for someone to fix problems for her, but as a capable employee assessing what’s going on, what she already knows and who is experienced enough to offer her wisdom. “And then I circle back with people and thank them for their advice or their counsel or their support or their resources,” Kat says. “That makes people want to be on your team. No one trusts someone who says ‘I’ve always got it.’ Nobody always has it.” Real confidence is curiosity Since curiosity and confidence go hand-in-hand, Kat likes to clear up a misconception around confidence. “People think confidence means I know what I’m doing. I have swagger . It's an old-school, overly masculine definition of confidence,” she says. But real confidence—confidence that both others and yourself can believe in? “It’s not I know what I’m doing . It’s I believe we can figure it out ,” Kat says. For leaders who both manage out and around and continue to move up, this more humble form of confidence acknowledges that every single person on a team is also on a development journey. This confidence begets curiosity: “I need feedback to grow and evolve as the times and ways we do things change,” Kat says. “Self-awareness requires checking in with people and reflecting about your own presence, performance and style.” Then, this inner reflection expands outward and that confidence of I believe we can figure it out becomes curiosity for how the team can succeed. “You’ll always be rewarded as a leader if you help your people win,” Kat says. Third driver: Meet your own needs Kat’s third driver might seem more self-serving. She got curious and made herself helpful not out of altruism, but because she needed to pay her bills, and picking up more shifts gave her better access to more income. But, it’s not selfish to align your career trajectory with your personal needs—whatever they are. In fact, doing so will help make certain you are on the right track for yourself. Meeting our most basic needs is essential for any work. But beyond paying for food, shelter, and clothing for ourselves and our families, Kat offers other skills for meeting our higher needs, as well. Find growth companies if you want to grow “Join a company that’s growing,” Kat says simply. “It’s a lot easier to have growth opportunities when the company is growing.” Now, joining an established company with flat or even shrinking growth is not necessarily a poor choice. Those companies can still offer plenty of knowledge and learning opportunities, and maybe just what you need to acquire skills and experience. But the simple math of the roles available suggests more of an opportunity ceiling, and that ceiling doesn’t keep getting lifted. “The opportunities are a bit more fixed and a bit more challenging to come by,” Kat says. “Growth companies really matter in creating opportunity [for yourself].” Reframe the power of saying no It sounds like Kat said yes to just about everything early in her career, because she pretty much did. She was at a stage where she had no other major commitments (except college, which she left to focus on her career), needed the income and had the time to earn it. The asks also were smaller then than they are now as an executive. Covering a shift is a much different commitment than spearheading a new marketing initiative, for example. So it was easier to say yes, and she didn’t need to say no quite so often. But now her priorities require her to use that little challenging word much more frequently. “You don’t want someone to help you with something who isn’t all in and isn’t the best,” Kat says to them. “And I won't be all in and it won't be the best because I have other priorities, and if I have to choose, I'm going to choose the things that are my priorities.” She learned the hard way what the price of overcommitting is in her twenties, when she vaulted into executive roles and continued to take on more and bigger responsibilities. She wanted to say yes, wanted to do everything, thought it all sounded amazing. Then she got to a point where she started letting people down—she had to cancel things, or couldn’t do her best work. Just like she reframed risk, she had to reframe what answering no meant to her. “As much as I want to say yes, what I want more is to preserve this positive version of me in your mind that is going to get ruined if I overcommit,” Kat says. “The art of reframing is a superpower. It puts things in a perspective that helps me make the decisions I should be comfortable making all along, even when I want to please people or I really do want to help this person.” Kat recognizes that it gets much easier to reframe no in these ways as you move up in both your personal and your professional life. A track record of experiences builds the confidence to be able to set your own needed boundaries and recognize your own capacity—and to leave space for the bigger and better things that come along. Because for growth-minded people looking always to expand upward, something bigger and better always comes along. And you’ll be able to say yes to more of the best opportunities with Kat’s three drivers in place—prioritizing your own needs, being genuinely helpful and remaining eternally curious. As she puts it: “That trifecta is a really interesting cocktail for professional growth.” Final thought: The starting point is “know thyself” If you need a single starting point to transform your career growth—whatever stage you’re at—Kat has two simple words: Know thyself. How to accomplish this? “Tune into your values,” she says. And if it’s daunting to dig inside yourself like that, it doesn’t have to be so personal. Kat recommends googling a common list of personal values by country or culture and seeing which ones resonate most with you across the board—from friends and family values to your faith, your intellect, your income, community service, anything. “It’s a really helpful exercise to pick a top five (or so) of those and use that as a grounding mechanism for all the why’s behind how you react, what you say yes to, what you say no to, the companies you choose to join,” Kat says. “Are your values being met by your work? Not everyone has the same top three values.” Kat thinks of this practice as a compass—all the advice you get and the books you read are roadmaps, but your inner compass helps you choose your direction. “If one job opportunity falls off or some unexpected opportunity comes up, the map changes,” she says. “If you have the compass you can navigate, literally and figuratively, those challenges or opportunities or moments with far more effective than you otherwise would be able to.” TAGS Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

Fueled by his passion for cooking, innovation and a focus on street food, he married the concepts to serve up Tacos raking up profits almost equivalent to Chick-fil-A and other QSR giants. By prioritizing traceability and best-sourced products, they have built a good relationship with both the vendors and customers. It wasn't always easy - sales in the first two years were slow, with Rypka personally giving out Tacos to people who were driving by. He was also maxing out his credit cards and taking loans to start out. However, they managed to gain their footing in the fast-food restaurant sector over time and grew from a single food truck to a chain of brick-and-mortar stores. Their popularity was further boosted when President Barack Obama placed orders from them when he was in Austin. Their first food-truck is still in operation, but Rypka prides himself for reaching his goal of getting into a brick-and-mortar restaurant. Their slogan, \"Damn Good\", was coined after hearing customer's comments when they tasted the tacos, and emphasizes the importance of customer feedback to Torchy's Tacos. The taco-of-the-month special also allows them to further innovate and bring in new concepts to their fast food restaurant, and have customers coming back for more. Let's delve further into how they managed to successfully kick start their business, to become the successful chain of fast-food restaurants they are today. Growing Through Redistribution The fresh, high-quality ingredients are what contribute to Torchy's Tacos' \"damn good tacos\", which means that they have to ensure timely deliveries of these ingredients to meet customer expectations. This can be attributed to efficient distribution centers and a redistribution program, which helps in maintaining quality, while at the same time reducing costs and improving inventory planning. With their flexible business model, expansion and growth can be accounted for, even across different markets across the globe. Produce can be sent to each store five days a week, while also maximizing the shelf life of perishables, by managing the environments (and temperature) in which the produce are delivered. Furthermore, the redistribution centers improve information management, allowing them to construct accurate demand-planning strategies and buy the right quantities of products. With transparent communication and a selection of limited suppliers, they are also able to maintain close relationships and maximize expansion, while ensuring consistent quality across their supply chain. Adapting in a Pandemic COVID-19 hit the QSR industry hard, and Torchy's Tacos was not left unscathed - they lost 50% of their sales and had to make an unfortunate decision to furlough hundreds of employees. It also halted their initial expansion plans, where they had a goal to open 100 new restaurants and build a presence in 17 states over five years. However, they were able to successfully turn this around by keeping their stores open by pivoting their business to fit changing consumer behaviors as a result of the pandemic. Expansion, Growth and Recruitment With careful consideration, Torchy's Tacos decided to go ahead with their expansion plan. Funds from the Paycheck Protection Program loan were crucial in securing jobs for their previously furloughed employees and enabled the onboarding of 1,000 new employees to aid in the expansion plan. They have also opened stores in new locations, to cater to people who wanted Torchy's Tacos in areas where they never operated previously. Changing Business Model As a result of the newly implemented safety measures, many fast-food restaurants were forced to shut down their dine-in service offerings. Torchy's reacted quickly by setting up tentages and outdoor point-of-sale systems to leverage patronage from curbside deliveries and drive-thrus. An outlet in Austin metro even went the extra mile to create a makeshift drive-thru, and Torchy's Tacos has also partnered with DoorDash to provide contactless delivery, which conveniences customers and simplifies delivery. All stores have also implemented additional safety measures such as the use of protective gear and rigorous cleaning processes. Other plans in the pipeline include ghost kitchens which act as a distribution and delivery hub instead of serving customers directly. Companies have also come forward to help in providing spaces for the setting up of such kitchens, making it easier for them to follow through with their plans. They are also considering a shift to smaller restaurants, which will still contain their signature patios, bars and unique signage, but at a smaller scale. Changes in Menu Offerings Torchy's Tacos has included family packages to feed a larger group, alongside alcohol delivery and do-it-yourself kits which allow customers to create their signature margaritas in their own time, which have been popular among customers. They continue to differentiate themselves from competitors with their 'craft-casual' branding, through quality food offerings and innovative menus. All food is made fresh, and the Taco of the Month keeps customers coming back for more since they have new offerings to look forward to every month. Adept Management Structure The store operators at Torchy's are managing partners and receive 7% of the operating profits every month, incentivizing them to incorporate innovative measures to drive profits and save the business. By understanding and talking to the customers, they have also developed a neighborhood delivery concept that allows pre-orders and click-to-collect options for food pickups. This also allows them to improve their customer relationship management through personalization since customer information can be collected without going through a third-party service. Adaptation of Corporate Offices Apart from their restaurants, Torchy's Tacos has looked into improving the efficiency of their corporate offices, where the majority of staff are working from home. The successful implementation of the style of working led the founders to reconsider their choice of moving to a larger working space. Penetrating the Retail Market Torchy's Tacos has also ventured into the retail sector, by selling their very own sauces (Green Chile Queso and Diablo Sauce) at Whole Foods. Customers can now pair these fan-favorite sauces with their homemade meals and enjoy the unique flavors in the comfort of their homes. With the sauces retailing at $7.99 and $9.99 respectively, Torchy's Tacos is able to diversify and grow their brand, while providing a unique experience for their fans. Fundraise with New Investors Torchy's Tacos is also leveraging investor funding in a bid to realize their expansion plans and goals. They have called for a round of funding, and CEO G.J. Hart has vocalized his hopes of expanding Torchy's Tacos by doubling in size and conquering 15 states by 2023. Alongside these, their high revenues and willingness to take risks in opening in small to mid-sized cities, have made them especially appealing, capturing the hearts of investors. They successfully sold a $400 million stake in the company to a new group of investors, while Rypka and other members of the original ownership group will continue reinvesting as individuals. Furthermore, investors are happy with the growth of the brand over the years since their initial investment and are confident that Torchy's Tacos will continue to exceed their expectations. Torchy's Tacos was able to focus on their redistribution strategy, leverage changing consumer behaviors and gain investor funding, all of which contributed to the success of their stores even despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, by aligning your brand with what the consumers and investors are looking for, you too will be able to pivot your fast food restaurant in the right direction and benefit from expansion and growth.

Having partnered with several Subway owners to rebuild their hiring processes over the past year, we felt like it was fitting for us to share their road to success, along with key strategies they have adopted to thrive in a COVID-19 world . 55 years ago, Fred DeLuca was inspired by Peter Buck to start a sandwich shop in the hopes of paying off his college tuition. With an initial investment of $1000 from Peter, they began their business relationship and opened their first submarine sandwich store in Connecticut, USA. The duo served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches which gained traction over time. In 1974, they made the decision to begin franchising, catapulting the brand into decades of remarkable growth. These sandwiches are now affectionately known as 'Subs' all across the globe. This is the birth story of Subway, one of the largest quick service restaurants (QSRs) with over 40,000 stores worldwide. Subway did not gain popularity overnight - it was their consistent effort to scale their operations and innovate that brought them to where they are today. Let's take a look at how they took 'Make it what you want' quite literally and paved their way to success, a $5 footlong at a time. The Growth of Subway The decision to begin franchising was pivotal in the initial growth of Subway, especially considering their humble beginning in Connecticut. With franchising opportunities, the Subway brand was able to gain recognition on a global scale. In 2000, Subway became the first U.S. quick service restaurant to operate in Tanzania. At that time, they had more than 2,700 Subway chains operating in countries outside America and Canada. They then ventured into non-traditional locations in the following years, opening stores in military facilities, hospitals and retail stores. By December 2008, they were crowned with the top honor in the Annual 'Franchise 500' rankings by Entrepreneur magazine for the 16th time. With more than 30,000 locations in 87 countries, they attributed their success to the support of their franchisees over the years. Even in the midst of a global recession, Subway continued to grow. This was possible through the constant re-examination of their strategies. One such example is changing their 10 markets of focus according to the rates of growth in comparison to what was initially anticipated. This was done by classifying markets into high growth-potential territories. As a QSR owner, consider how franchising will help in expanding your business. If your goal is to open many stores worldwide, that is close to impossible to do alone. It is also equally important to be aware of the business environment, through strategizing and classification. This will allow you to correctly identify which markets to break into. Subway’s Business Model Primary Business Model Subway's business model primarily revolves around their franchise-only system and non-traditional units. Franchising allows them to open many stores across the globe, raise awareness for their brand and reach the masses. They also operate with a focus on keeping costs down and profitability up, which allows them to remain affordable to franchisees. Most of Subway's growth and success is attributed to their franchise-only model. They realized that their best avenue for growth was through franchising and owner-operators, since entrepreneurs are motivated for the store to do well. This meant that franchisees were more likely to put more effort into growing the business, especially since their livelihoods depend on its success. As a result, Subway continues to operate using a 100% franchise model till today, and it doesn't end there. Motivating Franchisees Subway motivates franchisees to do their best, by giving out 'Franchisee of the Year' and 'Development Agent of the Year' awards in their conventions. These awards recognize the efforts and accomplishments of franchisees - from adding new stores to building sales, increasing profitability and achieving excellent store evaluations. Franchisees are also provided with guidance in running their businesses. Subway Development Agents help franchisees and are crucial in maintaining the growth of Subway's brand in their respective regions. Non-Traditional Units Daring to venture into non-traditional units is also a pivotal part of their business strategy. By putting together a proprietary model, they are able to analyze the economical impact and potential growth in the country. This allows them to plan and optimize their store openings in places where they can have a large number of restaurants and a faster impact on the economy. One of their franchisees was innovative and opened his store in a convenience store, something that was deemed impossible and unconventional to many. However, this step made it possible for Subway to leverage on low cost of entries, while benefiting from the vast number of convenience stores across the country. Therefore, by incorporating both franchising and non-traditional units, they are able to break out of the norm and tap on new opportunities. Furthermore, non-traditional outlets (think: airports, transportation hubs and Walmarts) allow them to reach more customers. These are people who might not have even considered Subway as an option previously. This helps in raising awareness of their brand and improving their business opportunities. Having a Vision and Goal-Setting Another key factor is having a vision and setting goals to reach it - this started off with DeLuca aiming to have 32 stores in the first 10 years of operation. It led to the concept of franchising, as he realized that he would not have been able to meet his goal alone. He then aimed for 5,000 stores in 1994, which was achieved by 1990, leading up to 10,000 stores in 1994. Now, in 2020, they have over 40,000 stores worldwide - an incredible feat which would not have been possible without their goals, grit, franchise strategy and willingness to embrace the unconventional. Similar to Subway, it is crucial to first start off with a goal in mind, and thereafter create a focused business model to reach these goals. Here are some questions to keep in mind: What is the value proposition of your brand? How would you be able to reduce operational costs? How should you develop and maintain relationships with your stakeholders? These are all essential in formulating a business model that works for your brand. Appealing to Consumers Understanding Consumer Trends By staying constantly abreast of consumer trends, Subway is able to understand what their customers want, and deliver to meet their expectations. In anticipation of the rise in delivery preferences, Subway expanded delivery options with third party providers. Some locations are even offering in-house delivery. To improve Customer Relationship Management, they also launched a loyalty program. This allows customers to collect points and redeem rewards, and make orders through their phones. Subway has also managed to toe the line between fast-food lovers and health conscious customers, successfully catering to both. With the realization that customers prioritize value, taste and health, Subway ensured that their product offerings are in line with these expectations. It allowed them to rank first in the three criteria, far ahead of their competitors. They also launched a national campaign targeting childhood obesity (F.R.E.S.H. Steps Childhood Obesity Prevention). This was done through promoting healthy choices in their menus, which further emphasized their standing as the healthier choice option in the fast food community. Adaptability and Localization Another key factor is adaptability. Their products are often localized to cater to the tastes of consumers in different regions, while at the same time retaining certain aspects (i.e. menu structure and size) to ensure consistency and familiarity across outlets. In Pittsburgh, they rolled out Subway pizzas, as Pizza is one of America's favorite foods. This is all while retaining the customization true to the Subway branding, where customers can decide on their pizza toppings to create a pizza that is uniquely theirs. Localization comes with its own set of challenges. They have to take into consideration the existence of cultural differences - such as more conservative cultures. Customers and staff were initially awkward due to the new concept of personalization in the sandwich. However, they are able to successfully navigate these hurdles through appropriate training for their staff. With their successful appeal to customers, Subway has managed to maintain their position as number one in consumer perception. By knowing what your customers want, you can discover pain points and cater your product or service to meet their needs. Localization then adds a unique twist which would further appeal to customers in specific markets. There is a need to find a balance to ensure consistency so that your brand can be identified. In this case, Subway stuck to footlong sandwiches, knowing that it is their unique value proposition. Going Digital In a bid to adapt to the increasing trend towards digitalization, Subway created a digital revolution strategy dubbed 'Subway Digital'. This series of technological changes, starting with their mobile application, aims to create a new customer experience in line with the digital age. Other foreseeable additions include the incorporation of kiosks collaborations through social media and social payment channels transparency to allow ease of access to nutritional information By integrating a digital strategy, Subway is able to stay relevant, especially with Millennials and Gen-Zs, who are increasingly connected through their phones and social media platforms. Subway launched their Facebook Messenger bot in 2017, allowing customers to customize their orders and make their purchases - alongside web and app ordering. As Facebook is one of the most widely used platforms, they were able to leverage on the popularity of the app and its features to improve their service offerings. In 2018, they further improved the process by allowing customers to name and save their sandwich order preference in the app, a stored payment method, and one-click rebuying. A seamless transition of the order from the phone app to the store ensures that employees benefit from the improvements in technology as well. Other features include Save-to calendar Sub Club loyalty program with cashback rewards Stackable discounts Rewards which are not automatically applied This year, they partnered with Olo, a digital food ordering platform, to allow their U.S restaurants to handle digital orders from third party destinations. Opportunities to digitize are endless and Subway has been able to stay relevant with continuous technological updates. This only leaves us more excited for everything else to come in the following years. Think of how you can bring digital transformation to your own QSR. Are there processes which can be made easier with technology? What will bring convenience to your customers? How can you ensure better customer relationship management (CRM)? Should you encounter a hurdle, think of the consumer journey and the possible pain points they face. This would help in diagnosing changes you could make to the entire user experience, especially in a digital aspect. Constant Innovation Apart from digitalization, Subway also takes part in constant innovation, to keep customers excited about their brand. They successfully ran a virtual reality competition in 2013, encouraging fans to create their own virtual stores online, monitor and drive sales, create a promotional video and complete an online interview. The campaign allowed the brand to gain awareness. They were also able to engage young entrepreneurs and teach these participants more about what goes behind Subway, in a fun and interactive way. Through this hands-on activity, Subway was able to get more people excited about their brand, while at the same time inspiring many to learn more about their brand and consider a career with Subway. Their innovations do not stop only in the digital sphere. After the introduction of premium ingredients like thick-carved turkey and Applewood-smoked bacon in their stores in 2016, 30% of their U.S. consumers mentioned that they were more likely to eat at Subway. The effects rippled in the younger demographics, as well as health-conscious consumers. 25% of their diners were first time or lapsed customers, proving overwhelming success. In 2018, they partnered with Tastemade to develop new menu items. The Green Goddess Tuna Melt was a successful example of such innovations, where franchisees requested for the sandwich to be available even beyond the promotional period. These recipes incorporated key ingredients based on global trends that were gaining traction, such as deviled eggs. Having real-time consumer insights from Tastemade allows them to be ahead of trends, scoring brownie points with their customers who are more than willing to try out these new creations. Continuous innovations over the years helps Subway in differentiating themselves from their competitors. It is especially crucial considering the oversaturation of fast food chains in the QSR industry. When it comes to innovation, there has to be a willingness to step out of your comfort zone. Be it through collaborations, elaborate customer surveys or innovative kitchens, think of how you can incorporate changes in your products or services. This will keep customers coming back for more. Limited-time product offerings tend to do well too! Sustainability Efforts As sustainability issues are brought into the spotlight over the years, Subway has also made a commitment to support the environment through the implementation of various measures. The first Subway Eco-Store was launched in 2007 - comprising energy saving equipment, recycled products making up their interior furnishings and a change in packaging. Their paper napkins are made from 100% recyclable materials. This was just the beginning of their shift towards sustainability. In the area of distribution, Subway relocated certain distribution centres, which allowed them to reduce their carbon footprint. Operational efficiency planning allows them to optimize their routes and vehicles, saving freight costs and the environment (with reduced greenhouse gas emission). They have switched to recyclable cutlery, energy-efficient lightbulbs and low-flow faucets and taps. These are all small changes with large effects once multiplied across their many stores. If we're going into statistics, they've saved an estimated 25 million kilowatt-hours of energy, 277 million gallons of water and 209.8 million bottles from landfills a year! Their sustainability efforts don't stop there. Although it may not be obvious, Tuna is the only seafood sandwich, echoing their belief that they should only source from non-threatened species and waters. With their attention to even these details, Subway is the only quick service restaurant on The International Pole & Line Foundation (IPNLF) list, as of 2017. Operating sustainability is a win-win solution for QSRs. Not only would you be able to contribute in saving the environment by reducing the carbon footprint, you can also enjoy operational cost savings. Benefit from a reduction in freight, energy and water costs, and at the same time gain the support of your customers! Adapting to COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic threw the world in a state of panic, and Subway has also been trying to do their part to help customers settle into a new normal. With social distancing and 'stay home' regulations in the initial phases of the pandemic, Subway's customers were unable to return to the stores. However, Subway saw an opportunity to convenience these customers. Some implementations include allowing them to purchase ingredients (which included prepackaged meats, vegetables and bread) online and opt for pick up, curbside or delivery options. They have also stepped up their cleaning procedures, while also providing masks and protective shields for their employees. Subway has gone a step further to help the community through their partnership with Feeding America, by providing a meal to Feeding America with every Footlong purchased. They also donated food across the U.K., Ireland, Latin America, New Zealand and the U.S. In honor of National Nurses Week, they donated a 6-inch sub to healthcare workers with each Subway order purchased through Postmates. These sandwiches were sent to participating healthcare facilities in communities severely affected by the pandemic. Through these initiatives, there is a feel good aspect for customers, as they are able to contribute to society by simply purchasing from Subway. Furthermore, Subway is able to prove that beyond just being a QSR, they are also a brand with a heart, and one that cares for their customers and the society as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic has once again reinforced the importance of adaptability. However, it is also about being empathetic and doing what you can to offer help to the community. This is very much appreciated, especially in the eyes of customers, and will be remembered for a long way to come. Through Subway's success story, we can attribute that their growth mainly stems from a solely franchise-dependent business model. But establishing a focused business model and developing good relations with your franchisees is not the only requirement for success. Metaphorically, building a QSR is similar to building a sub. They started with a goal in mind, which, in the 'sub building' context, is walking into the store knowing you'd like a sub. Having a well-established business model is equivalent to the bread in the recipe, as it acts as a good base. However, the bread requires supporting ingredients to be tasty - vegetables, meat, and sauces. That's where Subway incorporates stepping out of their comfort zone through innovations, unconventional store locations and most importantly, paying attention to what the consumers want. Finally, they embrace the digital age, pursue sustainability and be adaptable to any curve balls thrown at them (in this case, COVID-19) - similar to how the final sub is toasted in the oven, just enough to be the right temperature. When you're thinking of how to improve your QSR, remember the sub analogy, and take 'make it what you want' quite literally. The journey may not be easy, but the taste of success will be worth it.

Experts anticipate a 40-50% decline in discretionary spending and few industries have been spared from the devastation of the global pandemic. Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) are among those who have been severely hit - we’re seeing rapid sales declines and closures with some restaurants declaring bankruptcy. Even NPC International, the largest franchisee in America, and owner of more than 1,600 Pizza Hut and Wendy’s restaurants, is currently filing for bankruptcy . How then, should business owners navigate the situation in the coming months? Well, let’s take a look at how Auntie Anne’s dishes up key strategies (alongside their iconic pretzels) amidst the pandemic, which may be the light at the end of the tunnel for QSRs. You may also use this as a source inspiration and discover how you can adapt and implement these strategies in your business. Here is a summary of the key strategic takeaways from Auntie Anne’s 1. Pivot your product offerings 2. Pivot your business model and review 3. Digital transformation via marketing campaigns 4. Stay abreast of consumer trends 5. Stay ahead of the technological curve 6. Enhance relationships with key stakeholders Pivot Your Product Offerings To make up for the closure of many of their locations due to coronavirus guidelines, Auntie Anne’s rolled out their DIY At-Home Pretzel Kits containing ingredients and instructions for 10 soft pretzels. This was a great opportunistic move by the brand: they marketed the kits as a quick fix for those who missed the taste of their pretzels and needed another activity to curb lockdown boredom. By pivoting their product offerings, Auntie Anne’s generated significant buzz around their brand in the form of User Generated Content (UGC), as many customers posted photos of their end products. They were also able to garner the attention of several news publications. Auntie Anne’s then took their strategy a step further with a solid follow-up marketing campaign by hosting Facebook livestreams which featured the founder and president showing fans how to roll and recreate the pretzels. This allowed them to ensure the longevity and success of their campaign. Learning from their successes, it is crucial that you are well aware of the products your company has to offer. Think about how you can then make changes to existing products to fit the changing landscape while at the same time encouraging customers to talk about these changes on social media. Be sure to follow up with a solid marketing campaign to increase hype, constantly keep it at the top of mind and raise awareness which will help in driving the best results. Pivot Your Business Model and Review With the rise of online shopping and preference to stay home, retail foot traffic to stores have been declining over the years. This is further exacerbated by the safety-distancing guidelines associated with the coronavirus. Auntie Anne’s came up with a solution to “bring Pretzels to the people” instead, through catering, food trucks and mobile kitchens . By choosing to operate with mobile kitchens, they are able to bring their pretzels to high traffic locations with an option to relocate whenever necessary. Furthermore, they realized that customers are likely to order more items than they would at the mall, should they opt for delivery, allowing them to maximize their orders. Our advice for owners? Be open to pivot your business model and review costs when necessary. This creates more opportunities for you to innovate and go beyond the norm, which is especially crucial in times like these. Digital Transformation via Marketing Campaigns Apart from re-evaluating their product offerings and business model, Auntie Anne’s managed to successfully undergo a digital transformation through viral marketing campaigns. Despite the declining foot traffic in malls, they were able to increase unit volumes as they streamlined their marketing efforts to focus on online orders and delivery. One such campaign was the ‘ Recline to Dine chair ’, where customers could order pretzels by simply reclining the chair. In the same iconic bright blue shade of Auntie Anne’s logo, the chair contained an in-built WiFi system, which automatically made delivery orders based on the position of the chair. Through viral marketing and the concept of exclusivity (as only some fans could try out the reclining chair), they managed to generate hype and emphasize that the same experience was available through their Pretzel Perks app. This allowed them to cross-promote two products at the same time, all while raising awareness of their new delivery system! The fact is, you’ll hardly ever know when your content can go viral. Nonetheless, it is crucial that you strive to increase its shareability to maximize your odds of virality. The right mix of uniqueness, exclusivity and knowing where to focus your marketing efforts based on consumer trends (in this case, the popularity of online orders and delivery) is the key to creating a viral marketing campaign. Which leads us to the next point - stay abreast of consumer trends. Stay Abreast of Consumer Trends Auntie Anne’s also demonstrated their ability to identify and quickly act on consumer trends. The habit of snacking arose from customers not having enough time to get full meals, alongside varying moods, hunger levels and cravings throughout the day. They realized that customers prefer convenient, bite-sized snacks that are more easily eaten with one hand. That led to the creation of their fan-favorite pretzel nuggets. Today, Auntie Anne’s sells more pretzel nuggets than they do full-size pretzels! Knowing your audience is important - after all, they are ultimately the ones making the purchase, and supporting your brand. By being familiar with their likes and dislikes, you would be able to cater your products more to their needs, which gains their favor in return. Stay Ahead of the Technological Curve Digital transformation is exceptionally important in this day and age, so it should not come as a surprise that there is a need to stay ahead of the technological curve. Auntie Anne’s is among several other brands making the switch to Cloud-Based Systems across their different operation functions. Point-of-Sale (POS) and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are just some of the few cloud-based platforms that are growing in popularity. Consider making the switch to a cloud-based hiring platform like Workstream if you haven’t already done so. Especially with current coronavirus guidelines in place, Workstream’s virtual interviewing and mobile training capabilities have been a game-changer for over 5000 hiring managers. We provide you with convenience in coordinating cross-location management and hiring, especially since most QSRs hire across multiple store locations. Your hiring process is entirely customizable, and the optimization will undoubtedly help you reap cost savings in the long run. Enhance Relationships with Key Stakeholders Finally, Auntie Anne’s has been able to enhance their relationships with key stakeholders - in this case, mall operators. Through their delivery services and routine of having the drivers go into malls to pick up pretzels, they were able to gain better delivery access in malls , making the process hassle-free. With the efficient management of their services, mall operators were also more willing to provide them with delivery parking and other amenities. This highlights the importance of maintaining good relationships with your key stakeholders, as it can give your brand an edge over your competitors. You should also realize that customers are not the only stakeholders relevant to running a business and that maintaining good relationships with all stakeholders is beneficial to your company. We hope that learning about the success story and key strategies of Auntie Anne’s key strategies has helped in inspiring you to implement similar strategies to improve your QSR. A thorough understanding of your business model and actively engaging with customers and stakeholders is key to continually growing your business even in the midst of a global pandemic. Similarly, you should also be willing to constantly innovate and step out of your (or your business’) comfort zone to be able to navigate uncertain situations, and create a recipe for success.

Through food and service, Abtin is determined to make quality taste experiences accessible to all. With humble beginnings as a Subway sandwich artist, Abtin solidified his passion for the food service industry early on in his life, to become a multi-unit Subway® restaurant owner. Today, he operates several restaurant concepts, including Subway and a new Hawaiian poke concept, Poke Me, throughout Greater Los Angeles and Orange County. Abtin believes business thrives on two fundamentals: team and culture. Named #1 Multi-Unit Franchise Group in Los Angeles for three consecutive years (2013-2016), Abtin credits the continued growth of his concepts to his team members and the culture that's been shaped within the company. His methodology is to train and empower; a results-driven mentality that invests time, energy and guidance into his staff. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Abtin is a second generation Iranian-American. The hospitable nature deeply rooted within Iranian culture has influenced Abtin's leadership approach - an authentic \"lead by example\" mentality. Abtin is always in pursuit of what's next in the food service industry. He's passionate about integrating technology into the category, specifically robotics, AR/VR, and more. By combining team, culture and innovation, Abtin hopes to drive the food & beverage space into the future. Q: What professional accomplishments are you most proud of since you started working with Poke Me as a developer? Abtin: In 2017 we opened three locations under the Poke Me concept! This is a big accomplishment because the LA market is currently very saturated with food and beverage concepts. Opening the three locations, being cash flow positive and maintaining profitability is a great accomplishment for us. We chose to grow organically because we know that in this way, we can build the foundation for the future. Running a team of 50 people comes with great responsibilities, and yes it's a tough battle, a lot of work and you will also need to be involved in your business in order to succeed. Q: What is one piece of advice that you will give someone running a restaurant business? Abtin: I think patience is definitely the vehicle for success, and being business smart is the fuel. Focus on things that will have a high return over the course of a long period, like branding and company culture. You need to also be passionate in your work, and pay attention to all the important aspects of your business. In our case, something that I like to focus on is playing the long term game, and I'm sure in the end, this will make a difference between us and others. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Play the long-term game by building up your hiring system! A streamlined system is key in ensuring a good recruiting experience for your candidates, and will also help in optimizing the time your hiring manager spends daily. With Workstream, all applicants and current employees will appear within the same application, making it easy to track hiring and onboarding statuses. Workflows and stages will also help the hiring manager in managing candidate profiles, with the ability to review and recommend candidates, and even add interview and training notes. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Abtin: I think manpower and labor is an ongoing challenge, yet also an opportunity. Retaining employees has definitely been the biggest challenge, and it continues to be. These days, when you hire someone, especially for hourly jobs, it's tough when you see them leaving within seven to ten days because they've found a better job that pays 10 to 25 cents more an hour. Above everything that you face every day, the loyalty of your employees is very important. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Abtin: Everyone is moving fast, from the hourly workers to top management. In the near future, we will see more use of machine learning in hiring across our industry. We are just looking at the tip of the iceberg! Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Workstream's smart sponsorship feature is one way in which artificial intelligence and machine learning is utilized to optimize your job postings - which helps you to get in front of ten times as many job seekers. Data-driven analytics will also provide key information about where your applicants are coming from, and retention rates. Through this, you will be able to prioritize certain platforms which may provide long term hires, or identify opportunities to reduce spend! Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Abtin: Yes, I have worked as an hourly worker during high school, and back in college. When I was 16 years old, I worked in a Subway restaurant for my family. This helped me to gain life experiences, because I had the opportunity to see firsthand, and learn about the foundation of the organization. When I was doing my undergraduate studies, I also worked with people with disabilities. These experiences did shape my attitude, approach, and most importantly, my leadership style that I carry with me to this day. Q: How would you describe your company culture? Abtin: The Poke Me concept is an elevated concept as we're dealing with raw fish. Whether you're eating sushi, sashimi or any type of raw fish it's obviously a little bit more of a distinct concept and ambiance. The type of food that we're serving definitely attracts a certain type of team member and obviously, a certain type of consumer as well. For us, all these forces are working together to create the environment and culture that we live, breathe and work daily. For our business, it is very important to keep all our employees close and happy. Wondering how you can bring your franchise to greater heights?

    "status": "success",
    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 08/30/19 How to Handle a No-Show Hourly Worker Share this article There are few things as disruptive to a team and work environment than when an hourly worker doesn't show up for his or her scheduled shift. The reasons for these \"no-shows\" can span from something as seemingly harmless as forgetting a scheduled shift to the more serious, such as a family emergency or serious illness. Whether accidental and absent-minded or serious and complicated, a no-show can negative affect your team's morale and ability to accomplish its responsibilities and tasks for the day. However, there are steps you can take to mitigate the effect of a no-show hourly worker on your team and even decrease the likelihood of it happening again with four steps that emphasize strategic thinking, communication, and education. 1. Re-allocate limited resources When you first realize that an hourly worker hasn't shown up for his or her scheduled shift, it's likely you'll want to launch into crisis mode -- but you shouldn't panic. Yes, it's true that being down a scheduled employee will likely cause some strain on your resources, namely, your other scheduled workers. However, for the sake of your team, you need to remain calm and focus on how you can get your team through the day as smoothly as possible. First, assess the situation. Think about the responsibilities of the no-show worker and consider how those responsibilities could be distributed among those present. Make sure that you allocate those tasks in a way that's as fair and efficient as possible. Second, speak with your workers about the situation. Discuss what needs to be done, but more importantly, assure them that they have your full support throughout the day. If there's something you can do as the boss or manager to help pick up the slack and alleviate some of the stress, you should do pitch in. Show your workers that you recognize the inconvenience caused by one fewer co-worker to re-instill confidence in your team and ensure they don't feel like they are being penalized for the no-show. Contact and follow-up with your no-show worker After coming up with a game plan for how to make it through the day with one fewer employee, next, you need to contact the no-show worker. You should not wait until the worker's next scheduled shift , or wait a designated number of days to address the situation. It's important that you get in touch with your worker because, as previously mentioned, there are a variety of reasons as to why the worker could be absent, which could potentially be resolved quickly and can inevitably affect how to handle the conversation and situation in general. To prepare for the call, revisit your employee handbook or workplace policies to ensure you're clear on the established rules and protocol for a no-show situation . Then, call your worker and begin the conversation by stating that he or she was scheduled to work that day at that particular time. Depending on their answer - especially if the reason they no-showed was due to a mistake or misunderstanding - you can ask if they are able to make their shift. If they're not available, inform them that you will need to discuss this in-person, and then schedule a time to speak. If the worker is able to make the shift, you might consider having the conversation with him or her after their shift wraps up, or at another time, as it's still important to address what caused the potential no-show. If the worker is unable to make the shift, you'll want to plan ahead for that conversation. Determine consequences and enforce the policy Regardless of the reason for the worker's no-show (or even if they show up late), you will need to determine the consequence . It's best first to refer to what the employee handbook and workplace policies state before making a decision based on what (if anything) the no-show worker offers as an explanation. Depending on your seniority, you may have the discretion to decide what to do about the no-show. Of course, you'll need to consult and be consistent with existing policy, and how you've handled other no-shows in the past, but it's still important to consider the individual circumstances when determining the consequence. In the case of less serious reasons as to the no-show - forgot about the scheduled shift, slept through an alarm clock, didn't find someone to cover their shift - you'll want to follow the policy protocol. Possible consequences might include termination (depending on whether this is a repeat offender or other circumstances) or even a probation period for the worker. In the case of more serious reasons - a family emergency, a serious illness or injury - you'll again want to consult the policy and help the worker find a solution so that they can maintain their job. In all scenarios, it's important not to just focus on what the punishment is for their action. Make sure that the worker is aware of the current policy, and how to notify management if they are unable to make their shift. Additionally, communicate to the employee how their absence impacts the team - even if they are less sympathetic to how the absence might affect management, it's likely that they will feel some guilt towards letting down their fellow team members. Evaluate the systems in place to prevent future no-shows After making it through the day - and the conversation - with the no-show, revisit your employee handbook and workplace policies regarding scheduling and no-shows, and more importantly, how those policies are communicated to work. There are several things to consider when assessing these policies, including the reasons - and most common reasons - why workers don't show up to work , and whether there have been other workers who have had issues showing up to work or getting coverage for a shift in the past. If you find that the same reasons for no-shows continually pop-up, then you'll want to address that with your workers, through your policies, and through the systems you have in place for scheduling. For example, if employees cite difficulty in switching or getting coverage for a shift, or even if they need more advance notice about their schedules, think about how you, as the employer, can make that process easier and more effective. Look for gaps in the systems you have in place for creating and distributing schedules, how workers call in, and how workers can change or switch shifts, so that you can eliminate no-shows for administrative reasons. Additionally, as you evaluate the policies, make sure that you communicate them clearly and that your workers understand them. If you don't have an employee handbook, it's crucial that you create one -- and distribute it. Employee handbooks should be easily accessible to all workers, and they should know where to find it. You might even consider having a physical copy available at work or having some of the most important rules highlighted and posted somewhere in the workers' break room. Having these things on display and available ensures that employees know how to call out in advance, how to switch a shift, and the consequences for failure to follow protocol. Aside from making sure that all workers have access to a handbook, consider having a team meeting or retraining current staff so that they are well-informed on all of the policies. With every new hire, there should be an onboarding process that walks them through the policies. Effectively communicating policies with your team and educating them on what to do if they can't show up to a shift will help eliminate future no-shows. Ultimately, when an hourly worker doesn't show up for his or her shift, the whole team is impacted. That day will prove to be difficult, but the days that follow don't have to be. It's absolutely crucial that your workplace has policies in place - and effectively communicates them - to help prevent future no-shows. As you consider the reasons why workers are unable to show up for work, use that intel to adjust policies or address staffing issues, and you'll be able to maintain a happier and more productive work environment for all.

The pace of life is intensifying, and our obligations are becoming more numerous. But guess what? You've got this! A 24 hour schedule template is like having a magic wand that organizes your day into manageable chunks. The Importance of Effective Scheduling When it comes to managing time and boosting productivity, effective scheduling plays a pivotal role. A well-structured schedule template can help you streamline your daily work routine, save precious hours, and enhance efficiency. Maintaining Neatness in Your Schedule A neat layout is key when creating a comprehensive hourly schedule as it makes comprehension easier for anyone who views it - be they team members or yourself. Not only is it important to write down tasks, but it is also important to present them in an organized and understandable fashion. Consider color-coding based on task urgency or type using legible fonts for clarity, along with clear divisions between different sections of your simple schedule. These small touches add visual appeal, making planning less tedious while allowing quick navigation through schedules, whether monthly plans, cleaning rosters, or even single-day agendas. Remember: Our goal here isn't merely getting things done, but being able to do so without feeling overwhelmed because everything looks chaotic. Always keep neatness front and center when crafting schedules. Creating a Customizable Daily Work Schedule: A Step-by-Step Guide Time management is an art, and creating a customizable daily work schedule can be your paintbrush. Whether you're using Microsoft Word, or prefer to download a free 24-hour schedule word from our collection of blank schedule templates, the process remains simple. To start scheduling in Microsoft Word, begin by opening up this handy tool. Navigate to 'Insert', select 'Table', and voila. You have your canvas ready for plotting out tasks with specific times. If downloadable schedules are more appealing than starting from scratch on MS Word; we've got you covered. We offer various editable blank schedule template options that cater to different needs - all designed keeping efficiency in mind. Maintaining Neatness & Organization In Your Schedule A neat and organized timetable not only makes life easier but also boosts productivity levels significantly. And guess what? It's quite fun too. The first step towards achieving organizational nirvana lies in prioritizing tasks based on their urgency when filling out the hourly schedule. Next comes readability - make sure every entry stands clear as daylight by choosing typefaces like Arial or Times New Roman (size 12 usually does the trick.). Adding colorful borders around different types of activities could give them individual identities, making navigation through plans feel like a breeze. Incorporating these steps into creating customized daily work schedules doesn't just make them visually pleasing but ensures they serve their purpose efficiently - helping manage time better while boosting productivity levels significantly. Boosting Productivity With the Right Scheduling A well-structured weekly schedule plays a pivotal role in any organization or team structure's smooth operation. A customizable daily work schedule ensures tasks are allocated specific times based on priority levels using templates available online for free download. Such systems not only aid efficient task completion but also reduce stress as everyone knows exactly what they should do during their shift hours. Moreover, having breaks scheduled into your plan guarantees employees downtime to recharge before embarking on their next set of responsibilities. Making Your Workday More Efficient In this unique format where teams clock in for long stretches over fewer days - there's ample time dedicated towards rejuvenation enhancing overall performance while minimizing burnout risks significantly. Packed with features like progress tracking and clear visibility into who's doing what and when, these templates make accountability straightforward, encouraging individual responsibility among staff members, making every single day count. Your rest days matter Too. In many schedules, adequate rest periods between intense work sessions often get overlooked. However, in our suggested 24-hour setup, substantial intervals focus purely on relaxation. This balance enhances productivity while reducing health hazards associated with continuous exertion. Add Flavor To Your Tasks With Context To give more depth to your workday plan using a template download is by adding context or additional information about each job within your list. Including details such as deadlines or important notes directly into the template ensures nothing gets overlooked. This level of detail not only simplifies managing individual tasks but also contributes towards overall efficient time management too. Remember that optimizing isn't just about getting things done swiftly; it's about working smarter rather than harder. Navigating Through Action Items & Daily Tasks An Action Items Template zooms into specific tasks that need completion within certain deadlines. It's ideal for managing projects as it keeps everyone on their toes about responsibilities and timelines. If you prefer having all your weekly duties listed out clearly in one spot, then the Excel To-Do List Template would be perfect for you. The satisfaction derived from ticking off completed assignments not only gives a sense of fulfillment but also clarifies what requires attention next. Synchronizing Multiple Templates for Effective Time Management Using multiple templates doesn't mean juggling between documents; instead, they should work together as an integral component of your overall strategy. Having both macroscopic (monthly) and microscopic (daily task list) views helps balance immediate obligations against longer-term targets efficiently and effectively, saving valuable time and increasing productivity. This ultimately leads to success, whether in your personal or professional life. A Closer Look at Weekly Schedule Templates A glance at these handy helpers gives insight into what lies ahead over seven days while leaving room for noting important dates or deadlines.

These beauties let us plot activities well ahead while marking significant events spanning weeks rather than mere days. Smartsheet offers some stellar options here too: functional yet visually appealing calendar templates, perfect companions when juggling multiple projects simultaneously becomes second nature.

How do I create a 24-hour schedule in Google Sheets? In Google Sheets, you can make columns for each hour of the day and rows for tasks. Alternatively, use built-in templates under the \"Schedule\" category. Does Google have a schedule template? Yes, Google offers various customizable scheduling templates through its productivity suite, including daily schedules and calendar planners. How do you format a daily schedule? A daily schedule is typically formatted by time blocks. Prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance, then allocate specific times to complete them throughout the day.

No longer a prisoner to an ever-growing list of tasks, you can now unlock your productivity with a 24 hour schedule template. Creating a customizable daily work schedule isn't rocket science.

This significant event marks a decade of dedication, perseverance, and growth and it stands for an individual's resolute loyalty to their work and the company they represent. The 10 year work anniversary deserves recognition that matches its magnitude. Let's dive into the significance of work anniversaries and their benefits. The Significance of Work Anniversaries Work anniversaries aren't just a date on the calendar. They represent an employee's loyalty and dedication to your organization and employers should be celebrating these milestones. a 10 year work anniversary can supercharge morale, amplify job satisfaction levels, and help cultivate a positive work culture that echoes with laughter and high-fives instead of sighs or groans. Acknowledging employees' hard work is no longer optional in today's competitive business environment. It has become as vital as providing them with their paycheck every month. A Gallup survey found that employees who feel unrecognized are twice more likely to say \"Adios\" within the next year. Mental Boost from Celebrations Recognizing accomplishments such as reaching significant tenure landmarks can have profound psychological impacts on employees. These celebrations make them feel valued for their contributions and reaffirm their importance within the team structure - think about how you'd react if someone threw you a surprise party because they genuinely appreciate having you around. It's the little things that can make an employee loyal. Beyond Monetary Rewards: The Value of Recognition In this era where companies compete fiercely offering similar financial incentives, recognition stands out like neon lights against a dark night sky when it comes to retaining talent. No matter whether it's one-year work anniversary wishes or happy 25th work anniversary messages; acknowledging your staff members' professional life achievements creates bonds stronger than any monetary reward could ever forge. Research shows, while cash bonuses are great, acknowledgment from supervisors or peers often means even more during milestone celebrations like awesome eighth-work anniversaries. Understanding Employee Appreciation in the Post-Pandemic Era We're living in unprecedented times where businesses have had to adapt quickly. One significant change? The way we appreciate our employees. In this post-pandemic era, acknowledging each individual's contribution towards organizational success is crucial. Celebrating important moments like work anniversaries can make all the difference here. These celebrations remind everyone that every day spent working towards company goals matters - it's appreciated. A well-thought-out recognition program that includes celebrating key moments can significantly boost morale and engagement levels while retaining top talent within your organization. So let us navigate through these changing times together by valuing our greatest asset - our people - every step of the way. From One-Year to Decades-Long Celebrations A one-year work anniversary is quite special; it's their first milestone with you. You could say something like: \"Congratulations on reaching your one-year work anniversary. Your dedication and commitment to our team have been invaluable. Thank you for all that you do.\" For longer service anniversaries such as happy eighth or 25th ones, your message should reflect on the years filled with commitment and achievements. For instance: \"Happy 10th work anniversary. Over the past decade, you have consistently gone above and beyond in your role. Your tireless effort and enthusiasm have been a major factor in our team's accomplishments. Thank you for your continued commitment.\" Tailoring Gifts Based on Employees' Preferences Besides words that convey heartiest congratulations, thoughtful gifts can add another layer of appreciation. The trick lies in aligning these presents with individual preferences or interests outside professional life. This might mean giving additional paid leave for those who love traveling or wellness packages tailored towards health-conscious team members. Such gestures show respect for employees as individuals beyond their roles at work - building stronger relationships within teams while boosting morale too. Personalizing Gifts Based on Employees' Preferences The secret sauce to finding an ideal anniversary gift lies in understanding what each employee values most. Some might appreciate experiences such as team outings or fancy dinners, while others may prefer tangible items like personalized stationery or tech gadgets. Besides this, providing flexible options where employees choose their own rewards from a curated selection of experiences or products ensures they receive something they genuinely want. This approach demonstrates respect for individuality along with appreciation for all those hours of dedicated service. A popular choice among many organizations today is corporate gift cards, which cater to diverse tastes while still conveying gratitude towards hardworking staff members. Ten Unique Gift Suggestions Cash Bonus : A monetary reward always makes an impact by directly acknowledging the added value through years of service. Paid Time Off : Additional vacation days often resonate well with staff who highly regard work-life balance. Educational Courses/Workshops : Investing in professional development signals commitment towards nurturing growth within your company. Gym Memberships : Wellness perks showcase concern about health beyond working hours. Mentorship Opportunities : Pairing seasoned personnel with industry leaders provides invaluable learning opportunities that go far beyond traditional training programs. Acknowledging a Decade's Worth of Contributions The first step in this celebration begins with crafting heartfelt congratulations messages acknowledging their significant contributions over these years. This could range from consistent performance, innovative solutions, or even demonstrating never-ending team spirit within the organization. Your message might sound something like: \"Happy 10th Work Anniversary. Your relentless pursuit of excellence has not only contributed significantly to our growth but also fostered a positive environment within our team.\" Tailoring your messages according to each individual's unique role and achievements makes it more meaningful. For instance, if they've led successful projects or consistently met targets throughout these years, mention those accomplishments specifically. In addition to thoughtful words, consider organizing special events such as celebratory lunches with colleagues or surprise parties at the workplace. These go beyond expressing gratitude through mere words and truly show appreciation for employees who've been there every step of the way during both thick and thin times. You can make them feel valued by offering opportunities for professional growth alongside regular feedback sessions where they are heard. Regular feedback sessions play a crucial part in making them feel appreciated every day not just on anniversaries thereby fostering stronger relationships between employers and employees. Building Long-Term Relationships with Employees In the world of human resources, acknowledging work anniversaries is more than just a tradition. It's an essential strategy for fostering long-term relationships with your employees. By celebrating these milestones, employers send out a clear message - they value their team members' hard work and dedication. This practice goes beyond professional courtesy; it helps build strong bonds based on mutual respect and recognition. The Power of Regular Appreciation Acknowledging employee accomplishments shouldn't be limited to annual events like work anniversaries. Instead, expressing appreciation regularly throughout the year can make all the difference when it comes to boosting morale and job satisfaction. Saying \"thank you\" for a job well done or providing positive feedback encourages loyalty among staff members. Maintaining open communication channels allows constructive criticism which promotes personal growth within teams. An environment where everyone feels valued fosters transparency - key elements in nurturing lasting professional relationships. Communication: The Key to Trust Building Besides showing gratitude, another important aspect of relationship-building is maintaining open lines of communication between management and employees. This isn't simply about addressing issues as they arise it's also about creating an atmosphere where ideas can flow freely from both sides. Cultivating trust through regular interaction paves the way for honest conversations regarding any concerns or suggestions. Fostering such openness enables better problem-solving strategies leading towards collective growth. FAQs in Relation to 10 Year Work Anniversary What do you write in a 10 year work anniversary? Acknowledge their dedication, highlight significant contributions, and express gratitude for their loyalty. Make it personal and sincere to show genuine appreciation for the decade-long commitment. What should I say for 10 years of service? Celebrate the milestone by emphasizing the employee's growth, achievements, and positive impact on your organization over the past ten years. Show your deep respect for their enduring loyalty. What should I say in my work anniversary? Showcase your journey, thank colleagues who have supported you along the way, share key accomplishments and lessons learned. It's an opportunity to reflect on your growth within the company. Conclusion It's about acknowledging dedication, loyalty, and the countless contributions made over a decade. From crafting heartfelt messages to choosing personalized gifts, each gesture plays its part in boosting morale and job satisfaction. In today's competitive job market, these celebrations become even more crucial for employee retention. The pandemic has only heightened this need for appreciation. Remember that celebrating ten years of service isn't merely an annual ritual; it's an opportunity to foster long-term relationships with your team members.

There is no need to panic because we're here to help. The I-9 form is your ticket to building a rock-solid team and it's all about verifying an employee's identity and work authorization in the U.S. Our guide covers completion, verification, and storage for hourly employers that would help boost compliance immediately. Understanding the Purpose of the I-9 Form The Form I-9 is a crucial document in the hiring process, designed to ensure compliance with U.S. immigration laws. Its main objective is to verify that every new hire is legally authorized to work in America. Within three days of being hired, employees must present documents that prove their identity. By requiring the completion of the Form I-9, companies not only follow legal employment practices but also help prevent the employment of unauthorized workers. Who Needs to Complete the I-9 Form? All employers in the US must ensure that all new employees complete their Form I-9 documentation upon hiring, regardless of citizenship. However, independent contractors or sporadic domestic help are exempt from this requirement. It is crucial for companies to understand their responsibilities and avoid confusion between different categories of workers. Completing the I-9 Form: A Three-Step Guide Navigating the Form I-9 process may seem complex, but it's actually a simple three-step journey. Let's break down these steps to make your employee cycle I-9 compliance viewpoint clearer and easier. 1. Employee Information and Attestation The first part of this adventure involves filling out personal details by the employees themselves. This is where the form collects identifying information like full name, address, date of birth, etc., all crucial for employment eligibility confirmation. In addition to their personal data collection, they must also attest to their citizenship status - whether they are a United States citizen or not, lawful permanent residents, or aliens authorized to work in the U.S. until certain dates. Here, you can find detailed instructions on how an older Form I-9 should be correctly filled out with respect to different statuses. 2. Examining Documentation for Verification Moving onto step two. Here, employers play detective as they examine each person's Form I-9 documentation closely, ensuring that the documents provided by employees serve as valid proof of identity and employment authorization. This requires keen observation skills so that authenticity isn't compromised at any point during the completion of forms. You're dealing with important legal procedures here; hence, following guidelines carefully will keep you from stepping into potential pitfalls. 3. Re-verification and Rehire Scenarios Last but certainly not least, we have our third stage  with is re-verification & re-hires. In cases when an employee's document expires or if he/she gets re-hired within 36 months since the original completion date, then the updated Form I-9 procedure comes into play, which might include remote verification too. This doesn't apply to U.S. citizens nor individuals who initially presented receipts instead of actual documents according to USCIS alternative procedure rules. So breathe easy knowing there are exceptions to every rule. Key Takeaway: Mastering the I-9 form is a cinch with our three-step guide. Employees fill out personal details and attest to their citizenship status, employers verify document authenticity, and then comes re-verification for rehires or expired documents. Keep your wits about you to avoid legal pitfalls. Document Verification Requirements The Form I-9 process isn't as daunting as it seems and with the right information, you can navigate through this important part of onboarding with ease. The key to a smooth experience lies in understanding and following document verification requirements. Recognizing Acceptable Documents for Form I-9 To make your journey towards completing an employee's Form I-9 less bumpy, let's first identify what documents are acceptable. According to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), these include: A U.S. Passport or U.S. Passport Card A Permanent Resident Card or Green Card An Employment Authorization Document that contains a photograph or If none of the above is available - one document from List B (proving identity) and another from List C (proving employment authorization) Careful Examination: Your Key To Compliance Now it's time to examine each person's Form I-9 documentation meticulously. No photocopies allowed. All presented documents must appear genuine upon physical examination and relate directly to the individual presenting them. Tackling Remote Form I-9 Verification Process In today's digital world where remote hiring has become commonplace, there may be instances when you need to conduct verifications electronically via remote Form I-9 verification process. USCIS guidelines walk us through how we can maintain compliance while conducting such procedures remotely. Retaining and Storing I-9 Forms The importance of retaining and storing Form I-9s correctly cannot be overstated. These forms must be kept safe, readily available for inspection, but protected from unauthorized access. Understanding the Retention Rules You might ask, \"How long should we retain I-9 forms properly?\" The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has clear guidelines on this matter. You are required to keep a person's Form I-9 either three years after their hiring date or one year post-employment termination whichever is later. This means if an employee works less than three years with you, it's important to store their completed form until at least a year following their departure. For those who stay longer than that period, hold onto these documents for no less than three years since they started working with your company. Safeguarding Completed I-9 Forms Your options when it comes to storage include keeping physical copies in secure locations or digitally saving them electronically each method having its own merits based on your organizational needs. If you opt for electronic retention, though, bear in mind USCIS permits this under certain conditions such as system checks preventing unauthorized alterations/deletions of records alongside maintaining an audit trail detailing changes made since creation. A recommended practice is grouping all forms together within one file separate from other personnel files making them easily accessible during inspections while ensuring privacy standards are upheld. Remember not just current employees' documentation needs safeguarding; also remember former staff whose tenure falls within the stipulated time frames. Maintain Compliance Through Proper Storage Practice To ensure compliance throughout your Form I-9 process, create alert systems notifying impending expiration dates. Key Takeaway: Master the I-9 form maze by understanding retention rules, safeguarding completed forms, and maintaining compliance through proper storage practices. Remember to keep these documents for at least three years post-hiring or one year after termination - whichever comes later. Common Mistakes to Avoid When Completing an I-9 Form The I-9 form process is a crucial step in the hiring journey, yet it's often riddled with errors. Let's look into these typical blunders and discover how to stay away from them. Filling Inaccurate or Partial Information A recurring issue we see involves inaccurate or incomplete information on the form. For instance, not having Section 1 filled out by the employee before their first day of work can result in non-compliance issues. Similarly, employers who don't complete their section (Section 2) within three days after employment begins also fall into error territory. Mishandling Document Verification An integral part of making I-9 forms revolves around examining documents for verification purposes. Some employers overlook this critical stage when they fail to examine Form I-9 documentation properly - leading down a path towards potential compliance complications later on. Remember: original documents must be verified personally unless you're using an authorized representative or following remote procedures for your Form I-9 verifications. Poor Record Keeping Practices Record keeping is another area where slip-ups occur frequently - once that person's Form I-9 has been completed, retaining those records becomes essential as per federal guidelines which dictate holding onto these files either three years post-hire date OR one year after termination, whichever comes last. Inadequate Use Of Updated Forms Catching Up With The Latest Version We cannot stress enough about staying updated with newer versions available at all times because relying solely upon older forms may lead you straight into troubled waters if caught during audits and inspections. Decoding E-Verify and Its Relation to the I-9 Form Eager to understand how E-Verify complements your Form I-9 process? It's simpler than you think. This web-based system is a handy tool that assists employers in confirming an employee's eligibility for employment within the United States. The Interplay Between E-Verify and Your Completed Forms The relationship between Form I-9 and E-Verify is one of verification, as both are used to confirm an individual's identity and eligibility for employment in the United States. Completing a person's Form I-9 involves verifying their identity along with work authorization, collecting information on citizenship status like whether they are a lawful permanent resident or hold other types of employment authorization. This same set of details forms the basis when conducting verifications electronically through E-Verify. In essence, this service offers another layer of assurance beyond what physical examination can provide while examining an employee's Form I-9 documentation. Advantages Galore: Why Using Both Is A Win-Win Situation An enhanced level of confidence as fraudulent documents which might escape detection during manual checks can be identified easily via electronic cross-referencing using E-Verify. A bonus feature offered by this service comes into play especially under current global circumstances where remote working has become commonplace - Remote Form I-9 Verification Process. With flexibility being key, such alternative procedures make life easier both for employees as well as employers alike. Conclusion You've cracked the code on the I-9 form. You now understand its importance in hiring and compliance. The document verification requirements are no longer Greek to you. Your storage system for these forms is now foolproof and audit-ready. Mistakes? Not on your watch! Your I-9 process is error-free! And E-Verify? It's an additional part of your overall strategy. But remember, there's more to HR than just paperwork. There's hiring strategy, retention efforts, effective onboarding - all crucial aspects of building a successful team. If you're ready to dive deeper into these topics.

For the restaurants that have remained open through the pandemic, hiring has paradoxically been a challenge. But one major reason people are choosing not to work is about to expire: the enhanced unemployment benefits from the CARES act. With all signs pointing to the lowering of the extra $600/week , the incentive to stay home will be going away as it will again pay more to get back to work. Finally, restaurant hiring managers should expect to see a larger pool of applicants to choose from to shore up their locations ( which has been an ongoing problem ), so it's important to take stock of the positions to be filled and have a game plan in place to hire the right people. For example, attracting new talent the way McDonald's does may help you staff efficiently. How to avoid COVID rule-change whiplash. Perhaps more than any other industry, bars and restaurants have had to pivot on a moment's notice throughout this pandemic. Can we open? Can we re-open? Just outdoors? No more cash? Every other table? Closing earlier? It seems like everyday the city or state is imposing new rules and regulations that can make or break a business. Setting up a Twitter alert may be the best way to keep abreast of new mandates . This way, anytime your official city/county Twitter sends out new information, you'll get a push notification. Even seeing changes an hour earlier can have a huge impact in day to day operations. Another option is to use a services that monitors specific webpages for any changes . This way, if the city/county page that lists food service guidelines updates, you'll get a notification right away. In today's climate, knowledge is power... to stay open. Avoid being shut down: be rules-proactive. Unfortunately, indoor restaurants tend to be where the coronavirus can spread the easiest. Check out this chart on businesses in New Mexico , a state currently seeing a spike in positive cases: \"Restaurants make up 15% of the New Mexico businesses with at least one COVID-19 positive employee -- more than any other industry in the state.\" This is why government officials are cracking down on locations that violate the rules , handing out citations, fines, and even taking away their license to operate. Now is not a time to get unnecessarily shut down, so follow your city & state guidelines and stay in compliance. Being proactive about safety measures can mean your business stays open while the one next door closes. Want to know how to stay safe? We've got you covered with our complete guide to COVID-19 safety . And heed the advice that \"Bar Rescue\" host Jon Taffer gave recently: Build trust with your customers by showing your safety measures. Be open with your community that your business is hurting. They want to support you. Save money on advertising and marketing for now. Don't FOMO into becoming a delivery business. Just because you see a lot of it, doesn't mean it's profitable.

It's free to all job seekers , receives more than 250 million visitors each month, and helps Indeed employers in more than 50 countries find top talent. Because of the reputation Indeed has built, many hourly workers do an Indeed resume search to find their next job, which makes it a perfect place for you to list and promote your open role. If you want to hire in today’s competitive landscape, you need to use Indeed —and optimize each of your job postings within it. Before we dive deeper, let’s cover a few things around Indeed costs to help you get started with Indeed . Indeed plans How much is Indeed for employers? Well, Indeed offers a variety of plans to help hiring managers meet their specific hiring needs . With Indeed , you have access to tools that can help you improve the visibility of your job listings . With Indeed for employers, you can opt for sponsored listings, which give your job openings premium positions in the job search results. You might be wondering how much Indeed plans cost and what each plan includes. Indeed Resume plan With Indeed for employers, you can conduct unlimited resume searches under the Indeed Resume Plan. Employers pay $15 per prospective candidate they contact. This option is perfect for hiring managers who work in industries with low turnover rates. Indeed Standard and Indeed Professional Standard Subscriptions Many employers choose a subscription to get more value out of Indeed . The Standard Subscription Fee ($100/month) allows you to contact up to 30 candidates, and the Professional Standard ($250/month/user) allows up to 100 candidates. Indeed Advanced Plan Indeed also provides the Advanced Plan with a pay-per-click model. You only pay when prospective job seekers click on your sponsored job listing . The cost of this Indeed Sponsored job listing is $0.20 - $1.20 per click so this could be more friendly on the daily budget . Indeed Simple Plan The question how much is Indeed definitely changes depending on what you want. There's the Indeed Simple Plan, which allows employers to specify how much they are willing to spend daily or monthly for each job posting . How to post a job listing on Indeed Go to Indeed .com and create a free employer account using your company email Add details about your job posting Fill out the application questions Review and publish the job posting Add your account information Select \" Sponsor job \" or \"Post job without sponsoring\" to the right of \"Continue\" Tips to get the best results out of your Indeed job posting Writing a highly detailed and professional job posting helps attract qualified applicants. When writing a job posting , there are three key points to focus on: job title , job description , and applicant qualifications. Job title The job title should be specific and short (keep it under 80 characters) so it’s easy for job seekers to spot a role that they’re suited for. While the title should be brief enough to convey what the position is, it should also be creative. After all, this top-line real estate is your chance to help catch a job seeker ’s attention—and stand out above all the other job postings they might see. Take an assessment of the job titles that appear when you search for similar roles. Do they include certain terms? Do they mention salary? Do they include emojis? See what your competitors are doing, not so you can copy them but rather so you can learn what’s working. From there, add your brand twist to it so you can stand out and, ultimately, win more applicants. Here are a few examples of what a stand-out title could look like: Restaurant General Manager Chicago—Never Work Sundays Team Member—Daily Pay Available with Instant Pay! Crew Member Evening Shift—$18/hr Job description Job descriptions should be engaging, easy to read, and include terms related to the role and industry. This is an opportunity for you to sell the potential applicant on why they should work for you. Take this time to clearly and concisely outline not only the job responsibilities (shift hours, daily duties, etc.) and qualifications (experience, language proficiency, etc.), but also to highlight the benefits you offer and your restaurant’s culture. This can also include business values and mission statement. As you write job descriptions , make sure your job postings are optimized for search engines , by including SEO-rich keywords whenever possible. This will help your postings rank higher and drive more traffic to your open role. And remember, most applicants today are searching and applying for jobs on their phones. Listing the job description in short paragraphs and/or bullet form is ideal. Applicants' qualifications Let’s dive a little deeper into qualifications. In your job description , it’s important that you make a distinction between what's required and what's preferred but not mandatory. Most often, the qualifications that need explicit parameters include: Education Experience Certifications Language proficiency Skills Providing this level of clarity around qualifications helps applicants see whether or not they would be a great fit for the role before they invest any of their time (and yours!) pursuing the role. Bonus tip: Watch your budget With Indeed for employers, you have the option to sponsor job posts to maximize their exposure and reach. It’s a great feature to use. Make sure to track your job posting via Indeed 's performance reports so you can make sure your investment is producing the results you need. You can modify or cancel sponsored posts anytime by selecting \"Edit Job\" in the employer dashboard . Pricing is always a big factor for anyone looking to post on Indeed so if you want more than free job postings , sponsored job postings will be a great solution. Indeed is a great place to find a candidate for hire. That's why it's one of 25,000 job boards Workstream integrates with to make it easy for employers to source candidates. Want to learn how you can post to Indeed —and thousands of other job boards —through a single click and a  streamlined experience?

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/30/19 Q&A with Jerry Baldwin, Owner at Baldwin Consulting Share this article Jerry grew up standing on a milk crate running a Hobart Dishwasher, when needed, for his mom who was a Holiday Innkeeper. When short of help, it was a family affair for Jerry and his mom, a single parent. He remained in the business until he was engaged, but decided married life would be much simpler without having to run a hotel. This sparked a change in his career, to sales, for a very large broad line food service supply company. He quickly built his reputation as a specialist in restaurant chains. He had an innate understanding of their needs, especially in the supply chain. Jerry made strategic moves within the industry to expand and further his career. He became a turnaround specialist for food industry companies losing money, and is still known as the person who loves turnarounds to this day. Chances are, if you’ve eaten in a particular chain restaurant, Jerry has probably worked on the supply chain or been on the industry panel advising supply chain professionals that manage the supply chain there. He is a frequent guest speaker on chain-restaurant supply chains at industry functions. He spent the past years working for equity fund-owned chain restaurant concepts. Most of them had no supply chain departments when he started – such as McCormick & Schmick's, Craftwork's, and Quiznos. He was once an equity fund Interim CPO, and this experience guided Jerry to a successful career in supply chain consulting, with a growing portfolio of chain restaurants. While he primarily works with equity funds, some owning as many as 12 concepts, he also does work for small independent start up chains. He takes all the supply chain data from multiple chains, and seeks leverage and synergies in both direct and indirect spend, starting at the global level and ending with the line item detail to maximize savings. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Jerry: Overcoming the belief that purchasing is not an important function within a restaurant chain. For many years, chains simply took someone from operations, or another department, and made them in charge of purchasing. However, they had no experience and no understanding of the position. The term ‘Supply Chain; was unknown. We had to educate the Executive Team, because they felt that purchasing was simply a small part of the overall Supply Chain. Furthermore, the Supply Chain Head needed to be on the Executive Team for a successful concept. Q: How you would describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? Jerry: My company only has one person – me. I provide the expertise while being very hands on. I have established a culture of no contracts, if you want to retain me, we have a handshake deal and I’ll go to work. If you decide you no longer need me, simply give me a 30 day notice. I am available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for emergency supply chain direction on issues. I am fully transparent in my fees, I charge a set fee and do not take vendor rebates for any item. My goal is to pass all savings to the end user. This will allow the restaurant concept on the street to lower their food costs. While I work alone, I have a superior supply chain team of experts behind me. Many, if not all, have been a VP or Director of Supply Chain at restaurant concepts. They are all independent contractors. This allows us to manage projects of any size. This team lives and breathes chain restaurant supply chain every day. They can make things happen fast with their vast experience. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: To recruit a powerful team of independent contractors like Jerry did, Job Board Integrations will be effective in ensuring that you amplify your reach. By allowing you to post to over 25,000 job boards with a single click, put your company in front of thousands of quality candidates with ease. Furthermore, smart sponsorship also uses AI to optimize your job postings across multiple boards and social media sites, to reach 10x as many job seekers. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in supply chain today? Jerry: We are on a long cycle, over three years, of flat to low commodity pricing. Many chains have enjoyed this, but have not made plans to manage these changes. It will change, it is very cyclical. If unprepared, the impact will be huge, especially if food costs rise by a few points on a low margin business like restaurant chains. Distribution is as challenging as any time in the past. A few years ago, two of the largest distributors attempted to merge. This took well over 18 months and did not occur at the end. Few realize what this meant for the future. For a period of over 18 months the two largest distributors did not spend funds on adding on to the existing structures. More freezer space, dry warehouse spaces or needed improvements, as they were unsure of their final plan upon merger and if they would have multiple warehouses in the same cities. Although it wasn’t wrong to think this way, it did also result in a \"slot\" shortage in our industry. It takes a \"slot\" for each pallet to hold each individual item needed to run a restaurant in the warehouse. It is not unusual today to send out an RFP (Request For Proposal) for distribution services for a chain and not receive one single bid. They simply don't have the space for a chains proprietary item. Notice that straws used to have a printed wrapper and most don't now. That item took up a \"slot\" and had to make way for others. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Jerry: Being a leader is something each has to decide in their own way, but I believe it is driven by how you want the end result to be seen. I have always believed that each person in my department should be cross trained to completely understand the other job functions. This prepares them to make better decisions in every way. Without a full understanding of logistics, the category manager cannot make appropriate purchasing decisions. This means I lead the entire department into a cohesive group who would have cross conversations about any and all issues so that each department could make informed decisions. My style has always been “don't tell me no if you don’t have another proposal as to how we can solve the issue”. If you allow your staff to make decisions, they grow. Even if the decision is wrong it is a learning experience for them to understand why they could have made another decision with a different outcome. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Seasoned staff may be well familiar with making decisions, but how do you help your new hires to succeed too? Take a look at Workstream’s Orientation Checklist which includes tips for introducing new hires to coworkers, reviewing key policies and even gathering feedback. Additionally, consider mobile training , which will keep both new and existing employees up to date on your company policies, values and goals. You can also send handbooks, checklists and training videos via a text message link, making it conveniently accessible for your employees. This will also incentivize them in completing their onboarding materials. You will be able to instantly review completion rates, with SMS reminders to guarantee completion, which should give you a peace of mind. Q: Who inspires you and why? Jerry: I always go back to two people, Norman Brinker and Herb Kelleher. They were each true entrepreneurs who overcame all obstacles. Herb had an outrageous personality and stripped costs out of the airline much like a good team of supply chain and operations would do, and created the first low cost airline. Norman was a true gentleman and entrepreneur who left behind some of the greatest restaurant management quotes. He also trained a team who went on to lead some of the largest restaurant chains in America. He was, perhaps, the last of the true restauranteur breed. His book On The Brink is a great read of a true story. The book about Herb is correctly entitled The Art of Business: In the Footsteps of Giants. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Jerry: Hourly jobs put me through both high school and college. My first job, at 12, was pumping gas on Saturdays at a local small station. The owner paid me $12 for the day in cash. Being very mechanical, I found I could earn the most per hour by working as an auto mechanic. While I was covered in grease at the end of the day, I made more than most of my friends! It was just my mom and I so every penny counted. I look back on those days and smile.

The highest minimum wage in the US overall goes to Washington D.C. which has eclipsed the $17.00 mark! The highest minimum wage state however is Washington which is currently $16.28 per hour. Now states and big cities like New York City and Seattle can have their minimum wage laws, but businesses have control over how much higher they go past the minimum. Case in point, Hobby Lobby increased its to $18.50 per hour . How does the minimum wage work in the US The United States has a diverse economic landscape in which the federal minimum wage sets a baseline for the entire country. However, individual states have the authority to establish their own minimum wage laws , often surpassing the federal standard. However, there are states where the minimum wage remains lower than the national baseline. The federal and state-level minimum wage rates have been a contentious issue in America for decades, and employers, employees, and politicians all seem to have varying opinions on whether a higher minimum wage would be good for workers or not. On one hand, the cost of living has continued to increase each year while wages have remained stagnant. According to Investopedia, a family of four living on the federal minimum wage would fall well below the poverty line , which is $26,200 for the 48 contiguous states. And while the highest minimum wages in the U.S. generally belong to Washington , California , and Massachusetts ; the cost of living is also high in those states to justify the rates. On the other hand, the argument for a lower minimum wage is that a family was never actually meant to live off of this wage . Rather, the federal minimum wage is mostly for teens finding their first jobs, or those working supplemental jobs in addition to their main gigs. Raising the minimum may lead to employers not being able to offer new jobs, and for automation to push low-skilled workers out of the workforce completely. And of course, the federal minimum wage is a much more acceptable hourly rate in lower-cost areas of the U.S. Whichever side a business owner falls on, at the end of the day, there are two main considerations to keep in mind when determining the hourly rate you pay to your employees: 1) the actual law, and 2) the law of the market. Lucky for you, Workstream has created an hourly wage index tool that answers the ever stress-inducing question: how much should you pay your hourly workers? Which states have the highest minimum wages ? We already mentioned that Washington state wears the crown for the highest minimum wage in the US at $17 an hour. California is another state that boasts one of the highest minimum wages in the nation which is currently set at $14 per hour. The state has been at the forefront of the fight for workers' rights, and this commitment is reflected in its minimum wage policy. The high cost of living in many parts of California , particularly in major metropolitan areas, has been a driving force behind the push for a more substantial minimum wage to ensure that workers can meet their basic needs. Massachusetts rounds out the trio of states with high minimum wages, currently set at $13.50 per hour. The state has a history of prioritizing workers' rights, and the minimum wage reflects a commitment to providing fair compensation. Massachusetts has also implemented legislation to gradually increase the minimum wage over time, addressing concerns about income inequality and the rising cost of living in the state. These states' decisions to set higher minimum wages are part of a broader national conversation about income inequality and the need for fair compensation. While critics argue that higher minimum wages could lead to job losses or increased costs for businesses, proponents emphasize the importance of ensuring that all workers earn a living wage . As these states continue to grapple with economic challenges and social justice issues, the debate over minimum wage policies remains a central aspect of shaping the future of labor in the United States. Which states have the lowest minimum wages? One such state is Wyoming, where the minimum wage is set at the federal level of $7.25 per hour. Despite the state's relatively low cost of living , this minimum wage can present challenges for workers trying to make ends meet, particularly in areas with higher living costs. Wyoming's economic dependence on industries like agriculture and mining may contribute to the resistance in raising the minimum wage to levels seen in other states. Georgia maintains a minimum wage of $5.15 per hour, though most workers in the state are covered by the federal minimum wage . Georgia 's approach to the minimum wage reflects a combination of economic factors and political ideologies, where concerns about potential job losses due to wage hikes are weighed against the necessity of providing a living wage for workers. In Alabama , the minimum wage is also set at $7.25 per hour. The state's economic landscape, characterized by a mix of industries including manufacturing, finance, and healthcare , has contributed to the decision to align with the federal minimum wage . The debate over minimum wage policy in Alabama reflects broader discussions about economic inequality and the balance between fostering business growth and ensuring fair wages for workers. While these states currently have lower minimum wage rates , the broader national conversation about income inequality and the push for a higher federal minimum wage continues. Advocates argue that a living wage is essential for workers to meet basic needs, while opponents express concerns about potential job losses and the impact on small businesses . As the economic landscape evolves, the minimum wage debate remains a crucial aspect of shaping labor policies across the United States. Federal and state minimum wage laws The federal minimum wage for nonexempt employees is $7.25 per hour, and to stay in line with the law, a business cannot pay any non-exempt employee lower than this rate. Exempt employees (for example, restaurant workers who earn tips) can make under this rate, but their average hourly income including tips must come out to $7.25 per hour or more. The ultimate authority on the federal minimum wage is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor . Whether it’s a small business or one of the large employers , the FLSA applies to all. Using the hourly wage index will help clear up any confusion on how much to pay your employees. On the state level, over half of the states require businesses to pay more than the federal minimum, while other states at least meet the federal minimum, though they may have a lower rate that would solely apply to employers and employees that are not covered by the FLSA. Examples of such employees include commission-based employees (e.g. auto sales), taxi drivers, farm workers, and live-in domestic service workers. The law of the market The minimum wage is simply that: the minimum wage allowed by law. However, there is the law of the market that may be what truly defines what a business should pay in different cities and states, leading many organizations to compete for offering the highest minimum wage . As mentioned above, Hobby Lobby is setting its own “minimum wage” at $18.50 an hour, which is more than double the federal rate, and also higher than the state-level minimum of many of the states they operate in. This is one of the highest minimum wages in the U.S. and raises the baseline wages far above the minimum for job seekers in the area. Businesses in competitive states like New Jersey , Oregon , and Florida have been far outpacing the federal minimum wage to attract more talent. Amazon, for example, had set its minimum wage to $19 per hour, making it another company offering one of the highest minimum wages in the U.S. As the economy recovers, we expect hourly rates in most competitive cities to lean toward $15 and up, even if the federal minimum wage doesn’t change. Hiring at lower rates than this may be difficult, so employers must reassess how much they can afford to pay to attract the best talent.

Watch as Tony Lam , franchise owner of Wingstop, and Theresa Banegas, General Manager at Wingstop, shares how Workstream helped them save time in their hiring process. Wingstop is in the business of selling chicken wings and fries. My name is Tony Lam, and I am the owner of five Wingstops in the Bay Area. We had a really difficult time in finding quality employees. The process was long, it was cumbersome. Luckily for a tool like Workstream, to be able to help automate that whole process has been a godsend. Workstream has given me many hours back because I'm able to quickly scroll through the candidates. I can go through a list of like, 15 or 20 candidates within 15 minutes and sometimes, I'm actually able to set up that interview in less than 24 hours. And so, whenever I lose an employee, I'm able to bring up Workstream, select my candidates, do an interview, and be able to have a person fill in that shift within 24 hours. Any companies out there that's looking for a way to hire people, high quality candidates quickly, I would definitely recommend it. My name is Theresa Banegas, and I'm the General Manager here at Wingstop. Workstream has given me a lot of extra time so I find it very useful and more enjoyable when I am doing the hiring process. Then I'm able to see all the applicants information, have pre-questions so that I don't have to ask questions. I'm able to have applicants there on my phone. It's more convenient for me because I don't have to be on my laptop. So I feel like its more beneficial for us and our company so that way we can get people who have better availabilities, people who want to work, and less stress for us.

It's like the pizza wars of the 90's, but a lot less fun due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Around the same time that Domino's announced plans to hire another 20,000 employees , Pizza Hut announced it will be closing up to 300 locations . What's the big difference here? As odd as it may seem in this day and age, Pizza Hut still has a reputation of being a dine-in restaurant (who remembers the salad bar? Because I sure do). And even if the consumer has moved away from dining-in for quick pizza meals, Pizza Hut has been slow to adapt to the changing sentiment. On the other hand, Domino's has been embracing its identity of delivery pizza for years now, carving out a strong leadership position in the digital food delivery space. Even back in 2017, Domino's said that 90% of its orders are made online or through its app . So it's no wonder that during the pandemic, Domino's is poised to dominate the delivery pizza market. And with tens of thousands of new jobs to fill, it's a good thing Domino's has a secret sauce to their hiring process to find new employees in record time. Restaurants need to prepare for colder weather Might be a tough subject to consider when states are hitting record highs as of late (Death Valley just recorded the hottest temperature since 1913 , so that's terrifying), but colder weather will be here in just a few months. And with restaurants having reorganized themselves for outdoor service, managers will have to consider what they will do and right now is the time to prepare . At this point, hoping for indoor dining by the winter is becoming untenable with the virus still spiking in metros all across the country. At best, we could see a 50% capacity indoors in more cities, but other considerations should still be made. First, we expect a run on outdoor heaters so managers should try to procure some now . Again, now is the time to invest in them if possible since many cities require approval from the Department of Buildings and the Fire Department. Next, tarp roofs and walls may be allowed but many cities won't allow fixed roofs for expanded outdoor seating. After all, the entire point of the outdoor seating is to let fresh air mitigate the spread of the virus. Even cool plastic domes aren't safe . But for many locations, delivery and take out may be the only option in the winter. Check out how Wingstop is thriving with digital delivery for inspiration. In Other News... Who's hiring during the pandemic? Almost every industry has been hit hard by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But the operative word here is \"almost.\" If we had a time machine (or just were smarter), we'd invest our dollars into the businesses that have seen major hiring growth during this strange time in American and world history. With a new normal to the way people live their daily lives, we're seeing interesting spikes in hiring in certain sectors. Home Improvement When stuck at home for more time than anyone would expect, you start to notice things to fix or upgrade around the house. One thing during this scorching hot summer? Swimming pools. Which is why it makes sense that companies that install pools can't keep up with demand and has been trying to hire more workers ASAP. People seem to be finding time to finally fix that door hinge or redo that patio during quarantine as Home Depot is seeing a need for more employees as well. Sure enough, local contractors are seeing a ton of work and are looking to shore up their numbers as well. Of course, skilled trade jobs like these are much harder to fill (trade schools are the future, kids) but this all means that the home improvement sector will continue to need more employees overall during the rest of this \"house arrest\" that people are on. Anything with wheels Ok, so once they can't take being home any longer (after all, your neighbors are home too, always), Americans are getting out by driving, which is the safest form of social distanced traveling you can do at the moment (sorry environment). This leads to a slew of cars that need to be fixed and serviced, which is why companies like Autozone are seeing a need for more hands as well. About 20,000 more job openings , actually. We expect the automotive industry to continue to hire strong. Mind you, not sales of new cars. As the economy slumps, more Americans will be looking to fix up their current wheels and get them serviced. Well, unless they're buying RV's since the sale of these homes-on-wheels are booming at the moment as more people want to travel with all their stuff. Expect anything to do with RVs (servicing, RV parks, etc) to see increased hiring. Need help hiring the right people? Workstream can help.
