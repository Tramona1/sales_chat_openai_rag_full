    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 10/13/21 7 Qualities of a Great General Manager Share this article General managers are front and center of your restaurant‚Äîand probably your hiring crisis too. They‚Äôre the ones who lead the team, feel the pressure of your understaffed store, step up to cover shifts, address customer complaints, manage inventory, and, well, keep your entire business operating smoothly to help you earn as much profit as possible. When you don‚Äôt have a good GM, your brand reputation takes a hit, your customer satisfaction plummets, and your employees turnover faster‚Äîall of which can be detrimental to your business. Given today‚Äôs economic climate, having an incredible GM has never been more important. You need a GM that can take on both administrative duties and leadership responsibilities to bolster the entire restaurant experience. To help you spot a solid GM, here are the key traits you can look out for when filling (or backfilling) the role. 1. Positive Attitude The attitude a GM brings to work affects not only themselves but their employees as well. A passionate GM will be able to motivate their employees to do better by leading by example. This is especially important on days when business is slow‚Äîand even when it‚Äôs busy and everyone‚Äôs feeling drained. Be sure to look out for individuals who have a positive attitude as their optimistic outlook will likely be emulated by their employees! 2. Quick-Thinker A quick-thinker is someone who is able to come up with creative solutions on the spot when faced with a problem. Someone who can think on their feet will be able to make processes much more efficient, especially during high-stress situations. In restaurants, this quality can be particularly useful when there‚Äôs a lack of supplies or manpower or when dealing with an unhappy customer. Being able to resolve issues without compromising on employee treatment or customer service will allow the company to retain more employees and build loyalty. 3. Strong Interpersonal Skills A leader must have strong interpersonal skills, and a GM is no exception. This quality is essential for people who interact with both customers and employees. It empowers them to give great customer service and create meaningful employee experiences, both of which are critical to your business‚Äôs health. When a GM is tuned into building meaningful human connections, they‚Äôre also queued into when to give praise and when to provide constructive criticism. This is important because this empowers them to boost morale whenever the team is faced with stressful situations and creates operational efficiencies. 4. Patience In stressful work environments, hiccups are common. A GM needs to be able to manage these situations with a high level of patience. After all, the manager is in charge of ensuring that everyone is doing their job so that the restaurant can run smoothly‚Äîand that can‚Äôt happen if they panic (and unintentionally create chaos) when things get hard. They have to remain calm and composed even when everything else may feel off track. 5. Respectful The way an individual treats others around them, no matter their status, speaks a lot about them as a person. A GM who respects his staff and treats them like individuals instead of underlings is more likely to produce a happier team. In fact, respect was the top attribute employees voted as the most important in a survey conducted by Georgetown University . When a GM respects their staff, employees tend to feel more valued and this will increase their loyalty to the brand. This helps to retain them and reduce the unnecessary costs that come with hiring new employees. Likewise, customers who feel respected will feel more appreciated and are likely to come back as loyal customers. 6. Reliable Having to deal with different situations in a highly volatile workplace can get stressful sometimes. This is where the GM‚Äôs reliability can be a pillar of support for the employees. With a consistent way of management, employees know that they can always rely on their GMs, no matter what hurdle they face at work. 7. Ability to Set the Culture A great GM will establish and uphold standards‚Äîin the level of work expected and the culture the team embodies. A GM who can define and nurture a healthy culture is better equipped to align the team to business goals. It‚Äôs particularly important for a GM to have a track record for building a strong culture among hourly workers because hourly employees often feel disconnected from their company. By making them feel like they are a part of the organization, the GM is better able to produce loyal and diligent employees. Happy Hiring A GM is a key position at every restaurant; they‚Äôre the backbone of a healthy operation. They can take your restaurant to the next level, but only if they have the qualities needed to lead through the highs and lows they will inevitably face. So, as you look to hire one, be mindful of these traits during every phase of the interview process‚Äîespecially as you introduce them to the team. If you‚Äôre looking for ways to streamline your hiring process, look no further!

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 12/23/21 How to Out-Hire the Gig Economy Share this article Hiring hourly employees has become harder with the rise of the gig economy. More and more, people are choosing to work independently instead of the traditional jobs they would find downtown at their local restaurant or department store. But if you are like most managers and franchise owners, you are not ready to give up. If you‚Äôre looking to catch the attention of‚Äîand hire‚Äîthose flocking to gig jobs, you need to understand why gig work is so appealing and how to counter the appeal of the lifestyle. What is the Gig Economy? The gig economy is defined as the labor market where freelancers provide work for companies or individuals on a short-term or project basis. (Think DoorDash drivers, house cleaners, pet walkers, etc.) With today‚Äôs technology, it has become easier for employers and freelancers to connect. In fact, the ease is making the gig economy boom. It‚Äôs projected to gross $401.4 billion in 2022, according to a recent Mastercard report. Why are People Choosing Gig Work? The shift to the gig economy is a reflection of how people view work today. People are making the leap into the gig economy because they see that it provides them more flexibility and options with how work manifests in their everyday lives. There are companies like Home Depot that have really changed the game with their benefits packages , but that still doesn't appeal to gig workers. People want more work/life balance. With gig work, people can decide when they work. They can work day or night‚Äîand easily work around their personal schedules, making it easy for them to spend time with friends, attend a child‚Äôs school function, care for a parent, etc. The self-assigned and flexible scheduling makes way for life‚Äôs priorities. When it comes to work, people also want more control over what they do and how they do it. The gig economy allows them to choose whether they wish to take on a particular task or not and with whom. As an independent, they also have the freedom to accomplish the task as they see fit. They get paid to complete a task‚Äîwithout having someone tell them how it should be done. Lastly, people gravitate toward gig work for personal fulfillment. That‚Äôs because people often have a greater sense of satisfaction when they‚Äôre able to complete something (a project, a task, etc.) when it‚Äôs done on their terms. Additionally, the gig space gives people control of their workload. They can choose how many jobs to do‚Äîwhich also gives them direct control over how much they make. How Can You Get Gig Workers Interested in Your Jobs? You might be thinking you‚Äôre facing an uphill battle. It might feel near impossible to compete with the advantages of gig work. But we‚Äôve got you covered. Here are six things you can do to attract (and retain) employees who are in‚Äîor eyeing up‚Äîthe gig economy. Invest in (and Preserve) Your Company Culture Nothing‚Äôs better for drawing in applicants than having a reputation as a great place to work. Be intentional about creating a respectful, inclusive, and fun work environment. As a leader, you‚Äôre responsible for setting the energy for your team , and implementing and upholding shared values, keeping employees safe, and fostering empathy . Use the Latest Technology People want to work with the latest and greatest technology‚Äîespecially the modern workforce . When it comes to work, they want technology that will save them time and make them more efficient. And, this is true for an employee even as early into the employee journey as applying for a job. Make hiring easier by integrating text-to-apply and self-scheduling options. Move Fast Today‚Äôs workforce is accustomed to on-demand service. They want seamless experiences and quick results. Provide them with benefits that address their needs‚Äîlike flexible pay options so they can get paid at the end of every week or every shift. Offer Flexible Schedules Offering flexible schedules is one great way to compete with the gig economy for employees. People have busy lives and want more work/life balance. When you advertise your job opening or sit down to interview a candidate, let them know you offer the option of full-time work, part-time work, or rotating shifts. Include Personal Fulfillment Be sure to let current and potential employees know your mission statement and the real why behind your company. Let the employee know they are an important part of the solution, and not just a warm body doing a job. Show you support their contributions and give them autonomy (whenever possible) to determine how they do their work. Be open to new ways of getting work done‚Äîand you‚Äôll better position yourself to build trust and improve processes and procedures, which helps with the bottom line. Provide More Stability A drawback to gig work is how volatile it can be for some. You can, and should, communicate the stability you can offer. Employees who have strict income needs will appreciate knowing you can guarantee them a certain amount of hours every week, and then follow through. Final Thoughts Not every person will give up the gig economy lifestyle. But learning why people choose to go that way vs. the traditional route better helps you attract and retain the staff you want in the current labor market.

Writing job descriptions Whether you‚Äôre creating a brand new position or need to refresh an older job description, work your way through this checklist to ensure your post is optimized to attract applicants. *Remember, you can customize this to fit the unique needs of your business and the role by copying the Google template above. Pick a job title Include keywords to help your job post rank on search engines ‚≠ê Bonus: Include a benefit or perk next to the title to make it more enticing like Restaurant General Manager‚ÄîNever work Sundays List compensation expectations Indicate hours of work Full-time or part-time Typical work hours and shifts Days of the week Overtime expectations (if applicable) Indicate expected start date Describe the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities of the role List the skills and abilities needed for the role Describe the work environment Indoor Outdoor Describe the physical demands of the job Bending Sitting Lifting Driving List required education and experience List any additional eligibility qualifications Certifications Industry-specific experience Experience working with job-related equipment Compose an Affirmative Action Plan/Equal Employment Opportunity (AAP/EEO) statement Review your job description and trim it down so it‚Äôs clear, but concise. Remember, 60% of applicants search for jobs on their phones. Condense information into bullets where possible Promoting your job listing Once you‚Äôve optimized your job description, it‚Äôs time to get it in front of as many potential applicants as possible. Review these promotion recommendations to extend the reach of your job listing. Post to job boards Indeed Zip Recruiter Monster.com Google Jobs Glassdoor ‚≠ê Bonus: Many job boards will let you sponsor your job by listing it at the top of the search results for a fee Set up text-to-apply, a system that allows job seekers to start their application by texting a unique code Print posters and display posters featuring your text-to-apply code Include your text-to-apply code on flyers you give out with your product/service Send your text-to-apply code out in email Add your text-to-apply code to the bottom of your receipts Post to social media Share on your personal accounts to engage people you know Find social media groups related to your role (e.g. a Facebook group for cooks) Find social media groups for your local community to attract people in the area Offer your employees an incentive if someone they refer gets hired Encourage employees to share your open role on their social media accounts to increase reach Preparing to interview Your applicants have passed your screening and scheduled their interviews. What‚Äôs next? Use this checklist to make sure you‚Äôre offering the best interview experience for each candidate while also screening for the best possible employees. Week before the interview Review the candidate‚Äôs application, and make note of any questions you may have about their job history, gaps in employment, changes of career, etc. Double-check your questions to make sure they‚Äôre appropriate and not offensive and/ or discriminatory Organize all your questions, including behavioral and culture interview questions. If interviewing as a panel, make sure each participant is aligned and has the list of questions Make sure you‚Äôre prepared to answer questions about your organization, team, culture, etc. Know the next steps in the interview process so you can communicate that to candidates Day before the interview Reserve a space to conduct your interview Make sure it‚Äôs clean and free from distracting and/or confidential materials Review job description and required skills and competencies for the position Get ready to take notes, whether that‚Äôs on a notepad or via your phone or tablet Preparing to make an offer Time to review your interview notes and make a job offer. Use this checklist to make sure you‚Äôre thinking critically about who to hire. Complete your due diligence before selecting a candidate Gauge the interest level of the candidate after their interview Let the candidate know what next steps are and when they‚Äôll receive an update Review your notes and eliminate any candidates who were dishonest about their qualifications or failed to pass the screens Identify top candidates Call references Make your final decision If no candidate feels right, review your applicant pool again or repost the job listing ‚≠ê Tip: Throughout the entire interview and selection process, stay in touch with candidates via text message to keep them interested Partner with your Ops and/or HR team to determine the final details of the offer Extend a formal offer of employment to the selected candidate A phone call is a nice, personal way to share the news Onboarding new employees After your offer is accepted, it‚Äôs time to collect all the right forms and signatures to properly set them up for employment. Send your new hire an official offer letter and new hire forms W-4 E-Verify Form I-9 Direct Deposit form State Tax Withholding Company handbook Uniform policy Phone policy ‚≠ê Tip: Whenever possible, send digital forms and accept e-signatures. This makes it easy for employees to complete their paperwork quickly and even easier for you to keep track of it all. Workstream can help.

Register your new hire for orientation if applicable Send rejection letters to candidates who were interviewed and not selected. Rejection letter template Once you‚Äôve made an offer to a candidate and they‚Äôve accepted, it‚Äôs time to let the other applicants know. Rejections aren‚Äôt fun, but timely communication with applicants who‚Äôve interviewed with you is important. It shows respect and professionalism and leaves the candidate with a good impression of your business and brand. On the following pages, we‚Äôve also included sample rejection letters you can use as starting points when crafting your own. Important: Run your rejection letters past your HR or legal team before sending them to ensure you‚Äôre following company policy.

Is it concise and to the point? Did you run it by your legal and/or HR team?

Recognize their effort and work related to their responsibilities Call out moments they‚Äôve gone above and beyond their responsibilities Discuss ways they can grow Ask about their professional goals and if there are any roadblocks or additional resources they may need to be successful Set new targets based on previous performance ‚≠ê Tip: Let this be a discussion.

Wrap up Congratulate them on their performance and encourage them to keep up the good work Under-performing employees Take a look at their self-evaluation (if you had them complete one) Take note of how they view their own performance Have they identified any struggles you should address? Bring up potential areas of improvement Create a list of items you‚Äôd like to discuss Frame your feedback as what can be done to improve rather than weaknesses or deficiencies Be direct (but kind) rather than generic Make it a dialogue between the two of you vs. just talking at your employee. Ask them questions. Seek context. Give the employee time to absorb what they heard Acknowledge the areas where they performed well Offer help and advice Share personal experiences where possible. This allows feedback to be more authentic and meaningful and conveys empathy Don‚Äôt be mean. Your goal is to help them improve, so show you care and guide them in the right direction Wrap up Set realistic goals they can work on Reinforce that while there are things that need to be worked on, learning is part of the journey and you‚Äôre here to help Surprising and delighting employees A little recognition goes a long way in making your employees feel appreciated and proud to work for you. Tying rewards to milestones like anniversaries or good performance reviews is a great way to ensure you‚Äôre consistently showing your team some love. But we also recommend throwing in surprises here and there to delight employees when they least expect it. And remember, recognition doesn‚Äôt always need a price tag. Work your way through this checklist to reward your team in new ways all year round. Milestone rewards Take a moment to celebrate your employees‚Äô birthdays and work anniversaries Gift card to their favorite store or restaurant Movie tickets The day off Special treats like cake Celebratory lunch Performance rewards Acknowledge great performance, whether that‚Äôs during a performance review cycle, or a standout moment when employees go above and beyond Donate to their favorite cause in their name Give them some extra company swag Custom trophy or plaque (This is a fun way to award an Employee of the Month too!) Bonus Shoutouts on your social media pages or company-wide emails Team and peer rewards Celebrating as a team is a great way to build camaraderie. Celebrate great teamwork at least once a year Give the team new swag Do an offsite activity together like a night of bowling, group lunch, or tour of a local attraction Take a wellness class together, live or virtual Participate in a charity activity together Learn a new skill or hobby together like pottery or origami Acknowledge special occasions and holidays, especially if your team has to work during them Bring in treats Decorate your business Host a team party Encourage employees to dress up their uniform to match the occasion Implement a peer recognition program Enable employees to vote on who is the Employee of the Month Create a space for employees to shoutout each other whether it‚Äôs on paper or during team meetings Surprise rewards Find opportunities to surprise and delight your employees at least twice a year. It‚Äôs often enough that it doesn‚Äôt feel rare, but not so often that it loses its impact. Bring in treats Give employees new swag Set up an at-work scavenger hunt for employees to discover throughout the day (This could be as simple as hiding gold coins on St. Patrick‚Äôs Day.) Your business relies on the strength, health, and happiness of your people Managers juggle a lot. But when it comes to how you manage prospective and current employees, you can never drop the ball. Each interaction is an opportunity to attract an employee to your business or reinstate an employee‚Äôs loyalty to where they work.

Tens of thousands of fast food jobs ? Weren't we stuck neck-deep in a pandemic? Despite an economy-threatening pandemic, what do all the fast food openings we saw a few years ago teach us about fast food hiring trends and takeaways? A few positive factors resulted in the fast food hiring boom. Consumers were still venturing out as many cities avoided going back to imposing full lockdowns. And with many people, unfortunately, losing their jobs (if only temporarily), a lower-cost option was increasingly appealing to a large portion of the population. \"Getting delivery\" denotes fast food in many people's minds; if they're going to get a meal delivered, it's often what they've already been used to ordering. Additionally, with delivery fees adding up (so much so that cities have had to cap them ), many people go for the cheaper option. And of course, there's the measure of safety. Less time spent inside an establishment felt safer to consumers, and grabbing a meal from Subway or Chipotle (both among the best fast food places to work) is quick. What can other chain restaurants learn about fast food hiring from those that experienced increased sales during 2020? Highlighting affordability and the speed of pick-up orders can be selling points for people today. And once a new customer has tried a delivery or pick-up order, incentivizing them to do it again with a coupon can solidify your restaurant as a convenient option for many future orders. And hiring 20,000 employees to fill all those fast food openings? No better time to try an automated hiring solution. The great outdoors? The surge in restaurants applying for outdoor expansion permits was a very popular trend in many American cities. Of course, that trend was easier said than done for existing restaurants. Very few locations prioritize outdoor seating; many have just a few tables available on their patio. So eateries were forced to get creative in this fast-paced environment . Many locations converted their parking lots to expanded outdoor seating ( here's a good article on how to make outdoor seating better ). Some rearranged their patios to fit in a few more tables. Others expanded into adjacent, unused spaces, even though leasing another lot might be considered risky. In these various ways, outdoor dining was a lifeline for many fast food restaurants , and coupled with a robust take-out business and strategic fast food hiring, many actually thrived. Could we be in for a redesign of restaurants? More focus will continue to be put on outdoor seating at the very least, but the industry is endlessly creative. Especially since outdoor seating won't be feasible when the weather gets cold for many cities, we expect to see creative construction (and a slew of heaters! Get them now while it's hot, literally!) to maintain outdoor seating through at least the fall. Stay open: No sick employees Easier said than done, right? But many restaurants were forced to close as soon as they reopened due to positive cases among their staff . With officials issuing fines and shutting down locations that were not in compliance, it was important to avoid this in work environment at all costs. And avoiding it came down to instilling a sense of personal responsibility among your employees. Unfortunately, COVID-19 wasn't just an on-the-job hazard. More likely, employees were exposed during their off-time. While managers are unable to dictate how employees behave off-shift, it proved helpful to distribute information on how to be safe in their everyday lives. Most important of all was for each employee to quickly recognize any sign of being sick with the virus ¬†and not come into work. The best leaders can instill a sense of family in their restaurant staff, and if the sentiment of \"protecting each other\" can be propagated earnestly, employees will usually try their best to keep both their peers and their workplace safe and in business. Just tell them Morgan Freeman needs their help. Remote, Control Fat food hiring and onboarding is a fascinating process to engage in remotely. Doing everything remotely can be tough, especially for business managers and owners who have always done things a certain way, meaning in-person . It's hard work to teach an old boss new tricks, but now's the time to do it. With less face-to-face interactions with employees, managers are having trust issues, not just in whether their workers are actually \"working\" from home with or without flexible schedule ; but also trusting in their ability to manage from afar full time . According to Harvard Business High School , 40% of the managers surveyed expressed \" low self-confidence in their ability to manage workers remotely .\" So what can be done at each step of the way to alleviate this worry? Remote hiring for self-motivated employees More than ever before, now is an important time to hire self-motivated employees. Workers have to self-manage more often, even when working in the same store. Also, there is a level of personal responsibility to keep safe (even during off hours) and be adaptable on the job. Here is where intelligent screening of applicants is key. Have their previous jobs or positions been in situations where supervision by the general manager was low? If they still excelled, then that's an indication of self-motivation. Can they give an example of accomplishments that resulted from self-motivation? Do they want to climb the ladder and learn more skills? When fast food hiring, ask applicants to upload a 30-second video of themselves answering a question you pose to quickly weed out unmotivated candidates in two ways: if they give bad answers and if they're really unmotivated, they won't even bother to upload a video at all. Remote onboarding for self-motivated employees Once your new hire starts working, training is crucial to set them up for remote-working success. The key is to provide them with clear performance objectives that show a successful end result instead of giving them step-by-step instructions on how to do XYZ. The goal is important for remote management, not so much the path. Different employees will work differently. But if the performance objective is clear, self-motivated ones will get there by asking the right questions and trying things out. As you onboard them with training videos, make sure to stress that it's about the objectives more than anything else. Establishing this concept at the start of the working relationship is important for both the worker and the manager. The worker should quickly realize that it's up to them to do their job; that the manager will be there for guidance when asked, but won't hand-hold. Either they will thrive in this relationship or quickly wash out. The manager also benefits as trust is conveyed from the start of the relationship. Remote working for self-motivated employees According to the HBR article, \"...[remote crew members ] reporting high levels of monitoring, 49% were often or always anxious when carrying out their job.\" Oof. Remote managers are often checking in too often and micro-managing their remote workers. The goal is to have hired and onboarded self-motivated employees so the management level can be kept low. As we all know, fast food hiring is about hiring the right people for the right job, and now the jobs call for remote work and self-motivation. Need help hiring the right people? Workstream can help. Our platform gets you 4x the number of qualified applicants and reduces your time-to-hire by 70%. FAQs What is the highest paying fast-food job ? The highest paying fast-food job often varies depending on factors such as location, experience, and specific roles within the industry. However, managerial positions such as store manager , restaurant general manager , shift manager , or district manager tend to offer higher salaries compared to entry-level positions like cashier, sales associate , or food preparation worker. These managerial roles involve responsibilities such as overseeing customer orders operation, managing staff, and ensuring customer satisfaction, which typically command higher pay. What is the youngest age to work at fast-food ? The youngest age to work at a fast-food restaurant is usually determined by local labor laws and regulations. In many places, teenagers as young as 14 or 15 years old may be eligible to work part-time with restrictions on the number of hours they can work and the types of tasks they can perform. However, it's essential to check the specific laws in your area regarding minimum age requirements for employment. Where is the best place to work fast-food ? The best place to work in fast-food can vary based on individual preferences and priorities. Factors to consider may include company culture, opportunities for advancement, employee benefits, and work-life balance. Some food industry chains are known for their employee-friendly policies, training programs, and career development opportunities, while others may offer higher wages or better benefits packages. Ultimately, the best place to work fast-food is subjective and may differ from person to person. Is fast-food a good first job? Fast-food can indeed be a good first job for many individuals, especially teenagers and young adults. It provides valuable experience in areas such as customer service, teamwork , time management, and problem-solving, which are transferable skills applicable to various industries. Additionally, working in fast food like KFC , McDonald‚Äôs , Wendy‚Äôs , or Subway, can help individuals develop a strong work ethic, learn how to handle stressful situations, and build confidence in a professional setting. While it may not be a long-term career path for everyone, a fast-food job can serve as a stepping stone to other opportunities and help individuals gain valuable skills and experience early in their careers. What kind of jobs are at a fast food restaurant ? There are various jobs available at a fast-food restaurant , including but not limited to cashier, cook, food preparation worker, server, shift supervisor, and manager.

Based on the name of smoked and dried jalapeno pepper, Chipotle serves Mexican-inspired food such as tacos and burritos while boasting no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives. The brand has gone the extra mile to commit to local and organic produce, and are the first national restaurant brand to use only responsibly raised meat. Their commitment to the environment does not stop there, they have also pledged to divert 50% of their waste from landfills during 2020, and began recycling used plastic gloves into waste bags, used in 43% of their restaurants. Chipotle has experienced rapid growth in the past years, especially in Q1 of 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in nationwide closures of over 2,600 restaurants, as customers started to stay home based on new guidelines. Although the blow was cushioned by their efforts in digital transformation, their next steps are crucial in determining how they will be able to succeed, especially in these trying times. While in-store orders have dropped drastically by 75%, there has been a rise in delivery by 150% and ordering ahead by 120%. The launch of their new reward program has seen 11.5 million members to date, with a significant rise in members choosing to go digital from their previous store-only rewards program. Chipotle is also expecting up to 70% of its growth to stem from drive-thru lanes. These are just some of the changes Chipotle is experiencing, and what they're doing to leverage them. In view of COVID-19, they have also improved health and safety, from increased sanitation, masks for employees, and packaging seals for delivery orders. Takeout shelves will also be deployed. Chipotle's CEO, Brian Niccol, emphasizes their desire to keep the elevated digital business up and running, to counter the fall in dine-in customers. The Digital Era As quick-service restaurants (QSRs) are scrambling to meet the changing consumer behaviors and needs, digitalization remains one of the key differentiating factors between brands. There is a need to employ the use of the right technology, to ensure that one's brand remains relevant. Diving into the specifics, let's take a look at the various digital trends in the QSR sphere. These can be split into industry trends, COVID-19 behavioral trends, and more specifically, Gen Z behavioral trends. Industry Trends Mobile Applications are one of the ways that brands can use personalization to drive customer engagement, especially with the use of artificial intelligence. Starbucks has a real-time personalization engine that covers smart predictions and cross-sells based on the purchasing habit of the user. This is accompanied by an omnichannel experience , which bridges the gap between online and offline services, making it convenient to suit the preferences of customers across different touchpoints. Customer data can be collected to deliver personalized promotions, which in turn encourage customer engagement and sales. Geo-tagging or location-based tracking also allows brands to gain further insights based on their customers' behavior. A study shows that 69% of marketers are looking to employ location-based intelligence, mainly alongside loyalty programs to aid improve customer relationship management (CRM), and increase conversions. Artificial intelligence is what powers the trends listed above, with AI being incorporated in mobile applications, or used to streamline user data to generate actionable insights. These are then repurposed to cater to the unique needs of each customer, which in turn maximizes ROIs for the organizations. Relating to COVID-19, several brands have also pushed out contactless menus , which can be listed on TripAdvisor. By simply scanning the QR code on their mobile phones, customers are able to access restaurant menus without the fear of germs and virus spread. COVID-19 Behavioral Trends Consumer patterns have also been changing as people are slowly adapting to the 'new normal', and these behaviors should be studied and understood for businesses to successfully cater to changing needs. With more people staying home , new routines have been formed as people start getting used to working from home. While some skip dining out altogether with self-prepared meal options, others are skipping breakfast and lunch as they're no longer required to embark on a daily commute to work. Food delivery options are also increasingly popular, with 54% of people using at least one restaurant delivery option since the start of COVID-19. That being said, a significant majority (63%) still prefer ordering directly from a restaurant. Brands will now have to engage with customers online, be it through social media, websites, or mobile applications, to leverage these trends. Close to half of the customers are now relying on word of mouth to discover new eating hangouts, with brands capitalizing on this by incentivizing customers to post about their dining experiences online. 64% also wish to see restaurant staff prioritizing safety , either by wearing masks or PPE and while 49% appreciate having hand sanitizers provided at the table . Furthermore, social distancing guidelines have proven to be advantageous to QSR businesses, with people likely to exercise caution while heading outdoors . Instead of heading towards casual-dining restaurants, they are likely to instead visit QSRs for their speed. QSRs who have rolled out digital ordering solutions stand at the forefront, as millennials had already begun to gravitate towards these brands prior to the pandemic. Gen Z Behavioural Trends With Gen Z having $143 billion worth of buying power in the United States alone, it is crucial that QSRs understand their buying patterns, to successfully cash in on this significant group in the population. Prioritizing their reputation, Gen Zs are often pressured to make known their likes and dislikes by posting on social media , to emphasize that they are ahead of the trends. QSRs can cater to this behavior by creating unique products that are 'Instagram-worthy', in the hopes of going viral on social media. A successful example is Cha Cha Matcha in SoHo, Manhattan, where Cha Cha Matcha created dairy-free matcha lattes which could be ordered online, while also adapting food trends to the lattes (by adding Reishi mushroom), which increased their popularity. QSRs will also have to embrace technology, to remain appealing in the eyes of Gen Zs, as they expect to receive information immediately through their smartphones, making orders online, and getting things done efficiently. This can be done through mobile app ordering or contactless payment , both of which would be well appreciated by this group. Finally, Gen Z is also known for the highest rate of anxiety among other generations. QSRs can aim to create a stress-free and efficient purchase and payment process to win over these customers, be it through mobile applications or website orders which will minimize human interaction. Digital Ordering To keep up with the increasing trend of online orders, it is necessary for QSRs to work on digital ordering. Let's take a look at how Chipotle utilized in-app purchases, Virtual Farmer's Market, and delivery which helped in creating a better customer experience. In-App Purchases Chipotle first launched its mobile ordering application in 2009, allowing customers to do in-app purchases, store order preferences for convenience, and even place group orders under a single account. In April 2020, Chipotle ran a campaign where they gave away mini TABASCO bottles with digital orders. As a part of their \"Chipotle Together\" movement, they also encouraged their followers to engage with their posts and tag friends to win entree codes which were given out daily. This was effective in driving social interaction and connections between friends. Virtual Farmer's Market The Chipotle Virtual Farmer's Market took flight in June 2020, where Chipotle's suppliers are now able to sell products directly to consumers, such as meat and cheese. By supporting the suppliers and developing each of their sites individually, they are able to provide a new revenue stream while at the same time staying true to their commitment to sustainable farming practices. It will also help in building the resilience of their suppliers, especially in these trying times. All ingredients used in Chipotle restaurants are also highlighted on the Virtual Farmer's Market homepage, allowing fans to quickly access the suppliers behind their favorite products. To increase awareness of these products, Chipotle Virtual Farmer's Market-inspired recipes will also be posted on Chipotle's own TikTok channel. Chipotle is also doing their part to help farmers by providing education, scholarships, grants and even contracts, and have contributed over $500,000 to date, to support them. Delivery In a bid to increase engagement for their delivery model, Chipotle has also introduced the new sports predictor challenge, where new matchups are posted weekly. Fans who accurately predict the winners are then rewarded with free burritos for a year. This encourages customers to place deliveries, as this will allow them to participate in the challenge. Chipotle is also offering free deliveries with a minimum order of $10. Delivery trackers have also been put in place, allowing customers to track the drivers as soon as their orders are placed. By providing accurate and real-time information on deliveries, customers will have visibility on the progress of their orders, and the ability to make appropriate arrangements depending on the expected wait times. Capitalizing on Drive-Thrus Drive-thrus are a great alternative as they encourage social distancing, and customers are still able to purchase their favorite meals with peace of mind. QSRs also benefit from additional orders despite the reductions in in-store seating capacities. Chipotle has seen success in the implementation of drive-thrus, with 13% higher sales at their restaurants with drive-thrus, wittily dubbed as \"Chipotlanes\". These lanes will facilitate orders, as customers are able to immediately pick up food that has been ordered online, effectively reducing wait times. They are currently working towards 60% of their new restaurants having drive-thrus, and are even willing to relocate their stores just to add the additional lanes to meet their goals. In line with this expansion, they are also aggressively hiring, receiving close to 700,000 applicants nationwide and 8,000 new hires to date. Tapping on Social Media Finally, Chipotle is also leveraging social media to reach its target customers, to ensure that they remain relevant and ahead of the trends. In line with the launch of the Group Ordering feature on their mobile application, Chipotle created a #ChipotleSponsorUs challenge on TikTok. Families and friends can participate by showcasing why they should be sponsored, and 5 of the most creative groups will receive free burritos. This challenge was started as a clever response to many Chipotle fans asking to be sponsored by the brand on social media. Chipotle Together was also hosted on Zoom, providing an opportunity for Chipotle fans to attend live sessions with celebrities. Not only did it elevate customer engagement and make the experience personal, but Chipotle also used it as a way to collect more information about their younger audience. To provide a more seamless ordering experience, they have also incorporated a feature that allows mobile ordering through Facebook messenger, which is widely used by their audience. Currently only specific to Canada, customers can make their orders by chatting with Pepper, Chipotle's resident Concierge Bot. They will then be able to customize orders, use natural language to describe their order, and even link orders to their Chipotle Rewards account to redeem rewards. Chipotle went a step further by providing tamper-evident package seals, which ensure that all food is securely packaged upon delivery. The Chipotle application and website will also be supporting donations, allowing fans to give back by donating to organizations by rounding up their bill. Chipotle's digital transformation is met with significant success, fueled by their willingness to understand their customers and ability to meet their demands. By keeping track of industry and customer behavior trends, Chipotle is able to tailor its strategies, be it in terms of digital ordering, drive-thrus, or social media to capture the attention of their audience. Therefore, it is necessary that you, as a QSR owner, can relate to the customers, and incorporate strategies that will improve the customer experience and provide additional value. This will allow your business to leverage trends and behavioral changes brought about by COVID-19, and use them to your benefit. Ultimately, digitalization is an inevitable transformation process that all businesses should embrace sooner than later. One area that is often overlooked is the digitization of hiring, and how doing so can yield tremendous cost savings for your business.

The popular Mexican -inspired American fast-food chain has always been known for its product innovation, which started in 2012 with the widely popular Doritos Locos Tacos . Product development seems to be at the forefront of their strategy and they have succeeded tremendously. And this applies not only to their food menu. In 2018, Taco Bell even received an innovation award for its self-service technology using Elo‚Äôs Android architecture in its kiosks in America . How exactly has Taco Bell managed to maintain a reputation of being an innovative franchise in this day and age? Let‚Äôs find out. Understanding Demand - Targeting Millennials In recent years, Taco Bell has switched its target audience from family and children to millennials, even removing their kids‚Äô value menu during the transition. This particular demographic is known to be loyal to brands they trust and it is noteworthy to attract their attention considering the fact that they make up the largest demographic in the country (in the US alone, there are about 80 million millennials). In an effort to switch their core target consumers to millennials, Taco Bell came up with multiple strategies to appeal to this tech-savvy generation for the first time . Among others, they have ramped up their social media activities and even executed campaigns through Twitter and Snapchat to reach out to more millennials. This gives them a chance to increase engagement with their target consumers while, at the same time, expand their brand awareness through these social media users themselves. Moreover, they are aware that millennials are all about instant gratification and value moving through the queue quickly. That‚Äôs why they made use of technology to improve on their ordering and pick up services, making it more efficient than ever. It‚Äôs needless to say - Taco Bell is definitely trying their best to innovate their product and services so that their consumers will get what they want. The shift in focus towards millennials did not stop at targeting customers. The brand quickly recognized that millennials form a huge proportion of their workforce. This meant a need to engage with job-seekers differently , especially in job advertisements. Text-messaging has also become synonymous with the future of hiring - millennials are constantly on their mobile phones, and in a competitive market for talent, the first employer who responds usually lands the job applicant. Workstream‚Äôs end-to-end hiring platform harnesses the power of automated text messages to ensure your company is top of mind for candidates. Schedule a time with our hiring experts to see how you can optimize your hiring today! Menu Innovation According to Melissa Friebe, Vice President of Taco Bell ‚Äôs Insights Lab, their product innovations are simply a response to consumers‚Äô demands. That is, they are not merely innovating to make waves.¬† Rather, Taco Bell seeks to ensure their customers‚Äô food items needs are well-met. Here are some of the Taco Bell food menu items invented through their comprehensive market research. Doritos Locos Tacos While the all-time favorite product was released in 2012, R&D teams from both Taco Bell and Frito-Lay have been working on it since 2009. The idea of it arose when they found that most of their consumers liked putting potato chips in their sandwiches, while others said they loved the flavor of Doritos. They put two and two together and found a way to make their tacos more flavorful while meeting the demands of their customers. Since this combo ‚Äôs introduction, more than one billion of Doritos Locos Tacos have been sold, proving that you can never go wrong when you listen to what your consumers have to say and innovate accordingly. One thing‚Äôs for sure, the Doritos Locos Tacos has to be one of the most iconic food innovations in history just like grilled chicken products. Health-conscious Products It is nothing new - we are seeing a changing consumer trend where there are increasingly more individuals who prefer healthier and wholesome foods, even in fast food restaurants . And Taco Bell definitely did not miss the chance to ride this wave. In the same year of 2012, the brand launched its Cantina menu, which included higher quality ingredients and healthier options for those who prefer them. This portion of their Taco Bell menu items was well-received by the older crowd and women, segments of the populations the fast-food joint did not specifically target. By keeping up with the trends and innovating on new menus, it is no wonder Taco Bell is considered to be one of the most innovative brands in the quick service restaurants (QSR) industry which is so good . Prioritizing Customer Experience Digitization is ubiquitous in this day and age - Taco Bell knew that they had to adapt their processes to complement the behavioral changes their consumers are going through. In fact, they were the very first QSR to roll out the system of ordering and paying ahead through a mobile app, creating a great experience for customers who want to skip the queue. According to Rafik Hanna, senior director of Taco Bell ‚Äôs All Access, for every digital transition the company makes, they always ask, ‚Äòwhat is in it for the customer?‚Äô. Some of their efforts to create the best customer experience included expanding their delivery service by partnering with Grubhub . This was done in a bid to make sure that they are providing their remote customers with the best ordering experience by streamlining Taco Bell ‚Äôs delivery services. Additionally, the award-winning QSR technology used in their self-service kiosks were also rolled out so that customers could ‚Äòown‚Äô their ordering experiences. Customization of the food menu like cheesy , crunchy taco , soft taco , hard shell , etc., and the ordering of vegetarian options were made easier through the kiosks. Moreover, these kiosks are more inclusive as it includes multiple language options and even allows visually impaired users to navigate the menu through their Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant features. It is apparent they knew what customers need and set out to make changes in order to provide a great customer experience. On top of that, Taco Bell relaunched its website to provide a more seamless ordering experience for users. Customers are now able to search for their product names like best taco , cheesy gordita crunch , chipotle , taco sheels, crunchwrap supreme , etc., for faster ordering. In addition, the new nutrition calendar feature also allows easier access to ingredient information like flour tortilla , chalupa , nacho cheese sauce , hot sauce , etc., for those who have special dietary needs. Most importantly, Taco Bell ‚Äôs website (and mobile app) allow customers to eliminate queues and waiting time by ordering ahead which definitely goes well with their target consumers - millennials. Seeing how they appreciate getting their orders promptly, such improvements to their interface will definitely bring the customers back for more. Leveraging Social Media Given that their main target audience is a generation of tech-savvy individuals who spend a substantial amount of their time on social media , Taco Bell figured that leveraging these platforms is probably the best way to get to their consumers. Well, they are right. Through social media , not only are they able to advertise their products, but they can also have influencers do it for them. And let‚Äôs be frank, would you rather hear about a brand bragging about its own products or hear the compliments from an Instagram account you trust? Aside from influencers, Taco Bell also hopes consumers themselves are able to increase their brand awareness through word-of-mouth. How do they make it happen? By being a part of the social experience. While inventing new food products, the aesthetics of their menu are always on their minds. They want to ensure that their foods are attractive enough, or ‚Äòinsta-worthy‚Äô, so that consumers will want to take photos of their food to post on their social media . Eventually, these photos will reach the followers of these customers and kickstart a domino effect that will result in more people craving for their products. Taco Bell ‚Äôs social media platforms are used for many purposes. They closely monitor their Twitter account to ensure customers‚Äô complaints are at its minimum, uses Snapchat to give consumers a preview of its new menu, and utilizes Instagram to increase engagement with their loyal customers by posting artistic content instead of just posting ads on burritos . Whatever it is, Taco Bell is indeed making full use of the social media craze to get its brand out there. Reinventing their Stores Through Mobile Restaurants When the coronavirus pandemic hit, many businesses took a plunge with it. Fast-food chains that provide drive-thru services, however, are found to be recovering at much faster rates than those which do not. Unsurprisingly, most consumers prefer to get their food where human contact is at its minimum during this crisis, making such drive-thrus vital to a QSR‚Äôs operations. Taco Bell , in particular, acknowledged the significant importance of drive-thru business in recent months that they decided to open up a new location that dedicates itself to it - the Taco Bell Go Mobile. The Taco Bell Go Mobile location features two drive-thru lanes, one of which provides quick service for customers who placed their orders through the brand‚Äôs mobile app. Not only that, the outlet is packed with impressive technology. This includes a smart kitchen technology that allows them to detect the arrival of a customer who has placed an order through their mobile app and even suggesting the fastest route for the customer to get to their food. Taco Bell knew that adapting to the current situation is essential in retaining their customers. And right now, the situation is to not allow any more human contact than they need to. For this reason, they have included a contactless curbside pickup and tablet ordering outside the outlet operated by a group of their masked employees called the ‚ÄúBellhops‚Äù. Above all, this new location is significantly smaller than its traditional restaurants, calling for lower overhead costs for the company. This shows that Taco Bell has recognized the declining importance of their dining areas and are allocating more of their resources on innovating their drive-thru services to provide the best experience for their customers. As a matter of fact, this could even perhaps be the future of the QSR industry as we move forward. And it is something you might want to consider looking into for your own QSR. What‚Äôs Next for Taco Bell Taco Bell has certainly exceeded expectations when it comes to fulfilling the wants and needs of their customers regarding Mexican food . So are they really the perfect company every other organization can aspire to be? Not quite. Taco Bell operations rely heavily on hundreds of franchise operators, and most importantly, thousands of hourly front-end employees. A wise one learns from the mistakes of others, and from the stories of the McDonald‚Äôs hourly workers‚Äô strike from Los Angeles to California , Taco Bell has to take it upon themselves to ensure employees are being heard when operations become too complex. Besides, considering the fact that the bulk of their hourly workforce belongs to the demographic of their target consumers, Taco Bell cannot afford to turn a deaf ear to their complaints, should they arise. Earning the loyalty of its franchisees and employees is imperative to prevent the downfall of this authentic Mexican brand. If they can put just as much effort into them as they do for their customers, Taco Bell can and will definitely go a long way. Summing Up There is no doubt that Taco Bell is one of the most innovative Mexican restaurants in the industry. We have seen how they were able to succeed by keeping up with current trends and consistently innovating to meet the needs and wants of their customers. Emulating Taco Bell ‚Äôs practices will definitely bring your QSR to greater heights. But before keeping your customers satisfied, ensure that your employees‚Äô welfare is also well taken care of.

However, a post by Paul Graham from Y Combinator on how to be \" ramen profitable \" discusses a lot of tactics and strategies around how businesses can have a different form of profitability than what startups have traditionally aimed for. To be ramen profitable means to make just enough to pay the founders' living expenses. In the business world of retail, restaurants, and hospitality, to bootstrap and to be ramen profitable from day one is the norm, as it is traditionally harder to raise capital for your business. There is often a higher upfront investment, but the advantage of running a retail business is that it is often associated with better cash flows, as compared to Silicon Valley startups. My first business while I was in college was starting a Thai food business , Treehouse Restaurant . I founded the restaurant with two of my college friends, Elizabeth and Alicia. Over the course of 6 months, we came up with a business plan to start the business, hired over 20 part-time helpers and a chef, and launched the business exactly today 10 years ago. It was my second entrepreneurial experience, but it was also one of my most fun and interesting business startups. As I had limited capital in the early days of starting up the business, my teammates and I came up with creative ways to bootstrap and start Treehouse Restaurant. Here is what we did: 1. We bought equipment from a second-hand business To start a restaurant, there are many pieces of hardware or equipment that you will need - from tables, chairs, ovens, stoves, pots, pans, culinary, to a cash register (I thought about not buying this, but my co-founders convinced me otherwise)! The cost of purchasing these brand-new equipment could have easily cost more than $100,000. However, we did not have that much capital and hence, went around conducting massive research online to purchase the most reliable ones at a more reasonable price from different second-hand businesses, vendors, and companies. We actually managed to procure an older cash register that has been used by three other businesses but still worked perfectly well. For tables and chairs, we took a drive down to IKEA where we were able to purchase furniture at reasonable prices and self-assembled most of them with our friends and family. 2. Hire for excellence, not experience Other than purchasing equipment and hardware, the cost of hiring is one of the biggest costs and barriers to starting a retail business. Having to hire on a shoestring budget, I was not able to look for people with extensive years of experience. Instead, I sought to hire candidates who were hungry, passionate, and eager to learn. In short, I was planning to hire for excellence, not experience. To do this, I sourced out for applicants the traditional way by posting on the classified jobs section in various local newspapers and managed all my hiring on an excel spreadsheet. I manually used my phone to text these applicants and called them to coordinate over 100 back-to-back in-person interviews in the course of 4 weeks so I could have a good sense of who is a good culture fit for the team. I also devised different questions using online forms for the initial screening phase to have a better understanding of their availability, personality fit, and skillsets. My experience in hiring hourly workers for my Thai food restaurant was also one of the inspirations for me to start Workstream today as I personally witnessed and felt the pain of hiring and onboarding hourly retail workers. 3. We created a menu that overlapped different ingredients In order to keep the cost of goods low, we devised a menu that had at least 50% overlapping ingredients for every single main dish that we were selling and tried to limit the number of main dishes to less than seven dishes. For example, we would use the same chicken meat for Tom Yum Curry Chicken, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Pad Thai, and will also use the same peanuts and vegetables for different dishes as much as possible. We also tried to outsource the drinks and desserts that we sold by procuring them from a vendor whom we knew complemented our food well. This helped to reduce the costs and time from preparing the food on our own. 4. We standardized operations and created a Just-in-Time strategy for our supplies and food Similar to the Just-in-Time manufacturing standards popularized by Toyota, McDonald's, and General Motors, I standardized operations in the team such that there were structured steps. This way, any new employee who joins the team will be able to get up to speed with just 2 days of training and will be able to work full-time with the team efficiently. We created online tutorials and made them into videos by recording them so that people will be able to watch them at their own pace. We also created a Just-in-Time strategy for our supplies and food to ensure that minimal food will be wasted everyday (and if there was wastage, we donated them to the local YMCA). This was an important strategy as food waste is one of the highest costs for any food business. 5. We limited opening hours This may sound simple, but I do believe in the 80/20 rule, in which 80% of the business came in at lunchtime and dinnertime. By simply trying to limit the opening hours, I was able to reduce the cost of labor, electricity, and resources that could have been more leveraged during the busy periods. We also closed on Mondays to give everyone a break to re-energize and focused our efforts on the timings of the week that had the most business. Overall, bootstrapping and starting a restaurant was one of the most fun entrepreneurial journeys I have ever gone on. This involved dressing up as a tree (think Treehouse restaurant) to learning to hire many people in a very short amount of time, and learning to manage our finances and operations. It was definitely one of the more meaningful experiences of my life, and it has laid the foundation for me to work on Workstream to impact and transform the hiring experiences for companies hiring hourly workers .

Despite being an 8th-grade dropout, founder William Rosenberg always had an entrepreneurial spirit in him. From buying blocks of ice to sell ice chips to purchasing vehicles and converting them to mobile food trucks, Rosenberg already started running his own businesses in his early years. After noticing the popularity of donuts and coffee during his food truck business stint, Rosenberg decided to open his own restaurant, named Open Kettle, which focuses on snacks (yes, donuts!) and beverages. This will eventually grow to be the Dunkin‚Äô that we know today. The brand has had its fair share of corporate changes and even rebranded itself recently in order to stay abreast with the current trends. With 2018 being their most transformational year, what exactly was done by the brand which led them to be one of the top 10 fast-food chains in the world? Read on as we unpack their impeccable success in the QSR industry! Building a Digital Presence ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just time to make the donuts - it‚Äôs time to go social‚Äù - these are the words of John Costello, Dunkin‚Äôs President of Global Marketing and Innovation. And indeed they have. Diving into social media is possibly the best thing they have done to build their online presence. By using the new platforms to share content that inspires their customers, they are able to better engage with their customers on a more personal level. Moreover, Dunkin‚Äô treats all of their social channels separately and refrains from posting repetitive content across their channels. Their Twitter, for example, serves as a platform for them to speak one-on-one with their followers while their Facebook account is used to let fans in on the behind-the-scenes happenings of the stores. By having different purposes for the respective platforms , they are able to deepen their relationship with their customers, fostering a sense of loyalty for the brand. And by being in an industry filled with many established competitors, increased loyalty will definitely bring Dunkin‚Äô to greater heights in the long-run. Adapting to Different Markets & Trends Global Expansion While Dunkin‚Äô may have started off in the US, there is no denying their popularity outside the country. How else could the brand open over 3,100 stores in over 30 countries outside of the US? Their success overseas is not by sheer luck though. Dunkin‚Äô made it a point to adapt their offerings depending on the country the store is in. To make this happen, Dunkin‚Äô has a team dedicated to do research on what best fits the local tastes. And since the stores are completely franchised, this gives them a competitive advantage over global brands which might not provide a local touch to its overseas outlets. Some examples of menu innovations outside of the US include caramel macchiato with coffee cubes in South Korea. They even have kimchi-stuffed savory donuts to meet the spice preference of the locals there. In other countries, food products are not the only aspect that is modified to fit the culture. In Holland, for example, even their stores incorporate local culture by using Delft tiles. Becoming Sustainable In an effort to become a more socially responsible brand, Dunkin‚Äô has ramped up its efforts to be more sustainable. This includes the complete elimination of foam cups globally by the end of this year. In place of them will be their very own double-walled paper cups and recyclable coffee cup lids. Their efforts to be more sustainable are not only limited to this. Previously, the QSR has also committed to using only sustainable ingredients in their food products and even partnered up with World Coffee Research and the Sustainable Coffee Challenge to attain a more sustainable coffee supply chain. According to Dunkin‚Äô Brands‚Äô Senior Sustainability Specialist, Danielle Wood, 86% of their packaging in the US is made from ‚Äúrenewable resources, recyclable, and/or made from certified material‚Äù. Ultimately, the brand‚Äôs aim is to find a sustainable alternative that is able to replace single-use plastic packaging. And as more consumers become increasingly environmentally-conscious , this strategic move will likely benefit Dunkin‚Äô in the long-run. Increase in Health-conscious Consumers As with other QSRs, Dunkin‚Äô picked up on the rising trend of consumers opting for healthier options. And let‚Äôs be honest, can we really park donuts under that category? This is why they have come up with healthier menu offerings to meet the needs of their health-conscious customers. It may also be the reason why they‚Äôve decided to drop the word ‚ÄòDonuts‚Äô from their highly acclaimed former label, ‚ÄòDunkin‚Äô Donuts‚Äô. Fearing that they may be overly affiliated with the term ‚Äòdonuts‚Äô and drive new health-conscious customers away, they decided to rebrand themselves as a beverage-led brand since 60% of their sales are generated by their drinks anyway. But more on that in the next section. The important thing to note here is this - Dunkin‚Äô is flexible enough to adapt to the changing needs and trends of different markets. And one thing‚Äôs for sure - their adaptability has definitely gained them a sizable fan base, enough to make them one of the top fast-food chains in the world. Successful Rebranding With a tongue-in-cheek ad campaign in September 2018, Dunkin‚Äô told the world that they want to be on a ‚Äúfirst-name basis‚Äù with their customers and removed ‚ÄòDonuts‚Äô from their brand name. This is part of their rebranding journey to be known for more than just their donuts since they have other notable items on the menu as well (shout-out to their coffee). This move was also done in a bid to appeal to the younger crowd by upgrading its image and technology , especially because coffee-drinkers are getting younger and younger every year. By moving away from the ‚Äòdonut‚Äô term, Dunkin‚Äô has the flexibility to widen their reach into new consumer demographics, giving them an opportunity to strengthen their foothold in the coffee sector, which they are already dominating alongside Starbucks. Aside from changing their name, Dunkin‚Äô also added a number of changes to their stores as part of their rebranding movement. For one, they cut back on their menu offerings by 10% in an effort to simplify operations and launched their value menu, Dunkin‚Äô Go2s and Dunkin‚Äô Run $2, nationally. All of these are implemented purposefully to show that Dunkin‚Äô is evolving and is dedicated to being the on-the-go brand people can always depend on. Fortunately, the rebranding efforts are proving to be successful as customers did notice improvements in service quality, in terms of the brand's speed and accuracy of fulfilling orders. What‚Äôs more, the new name has received positive feedback too as guests still associate it with the pink-colored brand they have come to know and love. To make things better, Dunkin‚Äô stock price has more than doubled on the New York Stock Exchange just in the past 3 years as compared to competitor Starbucks, which has only increased by 20% over the same period. At least for now, this goes to show that the rebranding campaign has indeed paid off for the fast-food chain. Digital Innovation Mobile Ordering and Expansion of Delivery Methods Knowing that many of their customers use digital services, Dunkin‚Äô has also improved on their existing mobile app to offer their customers greater speed and convenience when ordering. Some of the services offered in the latest app include the On-the-Go Mobile Ordering in 2016 which allows users of the apps to order ahead. By utilizing this service, customers are able to skip in-store queues and simply pick up their orders in the store or via their drive-thrus. The On-the-Go Mobile Ordering function is not the only innovation Dunkin‚Äô has done on their mobile app. In fact, the brand is consistently testing out new ways to provide a seamless ordering experience for their customers. This includes implementing curbside delivery , where the customers can make orders online for store-pickup and not leave their cars when they come to collect their orders. Instead, Dunkin‚Äô employees will bring out their bagged goods straight to their vehicles. This, in addition to third-party delivery, is an effort to make their mobile ordering service more robust so that customers can make and receive their orders the way they would like to. Integration of Loyalty Program Into Mobile App Dunkin‚Äôs loyalty program, DD Perks Rewards Program, was first introduced in 2011 where members are able to gain points through their physical ‚ÄòDD card‚Äô. Now, they have integrated this program into their mobile app for greater convenience and flexibility for their loyal customers. Members need only show their DD Perks loyalty ID QR code in their mobile app to collect their reward points and can gain points for any eligible purchase no matter the payment method. Once they‚Äôve accrued 200 points, they can redeem a free beverage from participating Dunkin‚Äô stores. This loyalty program is so well-received that it has more than 12 million members as of September 2019, evidently adding on to their loyal customer base. Additionally, Dunkin‚Äô Brands‚Äô recent partnership with CardFree Inc. also allowed the QSR chain to acquire a perpetual license to the software used to build and run the mobile ordering and payment platform for Dunkin‚Äô US. Needless to say, this license will strongly support the company‚Äôs future digital initiatives, allowing them to further leverage their technological capabilities. Ordering with Amazon‚Äôs Alexa Stephanie Meltzer-Paul, Vice President of Digital and Loyalty Marketing for Dunkin‚Äô U.S., said¬† ‚ÄúAs a brand, we are always looking for ways to fit seamlessly into our guests‚Äô daily routines and provide new levels of convenience and speed. ‚Äù And what better way for them to do that than to make On-the-Go Mobile Ordering available through Amazon‚Äôs Alexa . Now, customers who have a DD Perks account and an Amazon account will be able to link them together, making the ordering of food from Dunkin‚Äô easier than ever! The Future of Dunkin‚Äô Thus far, we have seen the numerous ways Dunkin‚Äô has innovated its ways to bring the company to new heights. So, what is next for Dunkin‚Äô? Well, the brand has set aside $60 million for their NextGen stores - a redesign of their stores equipped with an eight-headed tap system, efficient coffee line and a pick-up area dedicated solely for mobile ordering, among others. At the end of 2019, there were 525 of such stores and the company is expecting it to increase to 1,400 by the end of 2020, though the numbers may have changed in light of the pandemic. However, moving forward, the concept of the NextGen stores may just replace every other outlet in the world due to its ease of ordering and convenience for the customers, the goal Dunkin‚Äô is ultimately aiming for. Moreover, with the new normal brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, the NewGen stores may have just come at the right time. Despite the heightened measures enforced to restrict unnecessary human contact, Dunkin‚Äôs NewGen store could still operate without interruptions since contactless payment was already implemented and most of their business was to-go and. On top of that, more customers are making their orders via drive-thrus, making the new double lane drive-thrus even more worthwhile. Thus, for Dunkin‚Äô, post-pandemic will probably not cause much of a problem for them, since they have the basic infrastructure in place to operate responsibly. Digitalization and innovation is an ongoing endeavor for every company, and that is exactly what Dunkin‚Äô is doing. There is an endless possibility when it comes to technology and the only way for you to stay relevant is to stay updated with the current trends in the industry. By constantly innovating on your products and services while having your customers‚Äô needs in mind, you might be well on your way to becoming one of the top 10 fast-food chains in the world.

Michelle: In an industry that is concept and trend driven, I went against the tide in hopes of bringing people the joy and the experience of sharing a meal. The warmth and human connection is still ultimately what will provide a memorable experience, along with great food. That is what I believe I have accomplished, that is far more rewarding than anything else. Q: How you would describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? Michelle: As I interviewed each staff member, I made it clear that each position is no greater than the other, and reiterated that we must take pride in what we do and do it with love and kindness. Great service will naturally follow. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Did you know that you can make use of smart screening to reduce the time spent on narrowing down candidates? Get applicants to upload a short introduction video, or consider using multiple choice questions and automate scoring. This way, only qualified applicants move on to the interview process. A streamlined feed also ensures that all employees, including current ones and even new applicants feed into the Workstream dashboard and mobile app. This allows you to manage all staff within the same system, and even customize workflows for each job posting to determine the stages, and whether candidates are automatically eligible for the next round. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Michelle: The challenges I have experienced and learned from many of my friends in the industry is figuring out how to keep the employees to stay focused and committed to their jobs. We need to bring back the dignity of work, and value and compensate the hard workers. Invest in proper training, to say the least. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Investing in proper training can also include utilizing mobile training . Make all onboarding documents accessible to your current and new employees, by sending them via a text message link. These materials can then be accessed anytime, anywhere. Instantly review completion rates, and rely on SMS reminders that will help in guaranteeing completion. You could also choose to go into paperless onboarding, which saves time and keeps all hiring documents in one place. Preserve all important HR documents, and set trigger alerts for incomplete paperwork which will benefit both the applicant and the hiring manager! Q: Who inspires you and why? Michelle: Personally, my mother Rose. She exemplifies strength and what it means to be persistent. I learned how to cook from her, and she picked it up for survival ‚Äì having to cook for nine children at a time. To be that resourceful and also practice creative thinking for survival, that is the perfect recipe in life. Professionally: Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. He never runs out of brilliant ideas, and has the energy to execute with excellence. The best part, he champions women! Which to me will always be the \"winning\" factor in making an enterprise a big success. Q:¬†How would you describe your leadership style? Michelle: I was raised with \"Do as I do, and not Do as I say\". Leadership is about being part of the team and empowering each one to be a good team player, and sharing the tools to be a leader. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Michelle: Yes I have! My first job in NY was for a high end Japanese restaurant on Fifth Avenue. I was fortunate to be making $13 per hour as a host when the min wage at that time was no more than $4.75. Having lived in Japan, I managed to converse in Japanese, which surely helped. The exposure and experience only proved that New York embraces diversity. Looking for tips on how to streamline your hiring processes?

Originally from Long Island, New York, he attended Westbury Vocational School for the Culinary Arts throughout high school and furthered his culinary career at Johnson & Wales in Rhode Island. After graduating from Johnson & Wales, Jaeckle began his career in the bustling city, at An American Place. This was followed with 7 years of experience in Union Square Hospitality group, where he split his time between Tabla and Eleven Madison Park. His interest in Asian flavors drew¬†him to Morimoto, where he served as a sous chef. This was also where Jaeckle¬†developed his precision and reverence in the creation of Japanese cuisine. Jaeckle joined Michael White and team at the Altamarea Group thereafter. Under his direction as Chef de Cuisine, Ai Fiori was awarded with a Michelin star as well as a three-star review from The New York Times in 2011. In 2013, he moved on to open All'onda as proprietor and chef. All‚Äôonda has been heralded by Thrillist as one of New York City's 11 Best Restaurants of 2014. Jaeckle was also named as Eater's 2014 New York City Chef of the Year. His passion for Japanese cuisine led him to open Uma Temakeria. This was the nation's first fast-casual style eatery featuring fresh, customer designed temaki - cone-shaped \"hand roll\" sushi. With a burning desire to build his culinary versatility, he founded Kitchen Connect Consulting, and focused on menu development for All'onda Dubai, as well as several other concepts ranging from French Brasserie's to Latin Taquerias and Airport Dining. Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Chris: I have had many challenges in my life and career. However, what I consider to be my biggest challenge cannot be equated to a single moment. Taking the risk of being the face and name of a brand is more emotionally taxing than I could have ever imagined, or describe. I find that people don't discuss this, and they should start. Q: How you would describe your company culture, and what are the superpowers of your team? Chris: I have always tried to offer a culture that allows for open dialogue. Anyone can and should feel comfortable talking to me about anything. Q: Who inspires you and why? Chris: There are countless numbers of people who have inspired me over the years. I will choose to mention the person inspiring me currently, rather than all of the people who have in my past. Tim Ferris really gets my juices flowing. His podcast, The Tim Ferris Show, dives deep into conversations and asks the questions that require answers from his guests. This helps me and I‚Äôm sure many others too, to think more about every subject. Q: How would you describe your leadership style? Chris: I would say responsive, if I have to choose a word. I believe that sense of urgency is a huge motivator. if you are unwilling to respond in a timely manner, your team will follow suit. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Here are some ways that you too, can improve your responsiveness during the recruiting process! (1) With a streamlined feed , view all applications via email or mobile within the Worksteam dashboard, review and recommend candidates. This also means that you‚Äôll be able to quickly respond to each candidate, and also easily access all applicants‚Äô information (even across multiple job boards), with one database. (2) Automated scheduling ensures that you‚Äôd no longer have to schedule interviews personally. Select the candidates you want to shortlist, and they‚Äôll instantly get a text message link to your calendar, allowing them to schedule a zoom at a time of their convenience. They‚Äôre event sent text reminders, to prevent ghosting. (3) Hire in seconds by automatically sending out text message links to offer letters, HR documents and more. This ensures that you‚Äôll be able to reach candidates quickly as soon as there‚Äôs a change in application status, and won‚Äôt lose your desired applicants to other companies. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Chris: I live in NYC, which is the toughest market in the world. I read a report that said job growth here (in hospitality) declined for the first time in decades. Many equate this contraction to an increase in minimum wage, and the reduction in tip credit. However, I also believe that secondary markets are attracting talent that used to flock to New York, with dreams of success and grandeur. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Even with a fall in job growth, maximize your hiring potential with text-to-apply posters. Print out a poster bearing a QR code, which allows potential candidates to scan it or text the number displayed, automatically granting them access to a link to all open positions. Job board integrations will also allow you to hire across multiple job boards, and view all applications in the same dashboard. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Chris: I have had several hourly jobs. It is the only way to get ahead in the hospitality industry. I believe that there is nothing more important than building a foundation. In my industry, in my opinion, developing the humility that comes with washing dishes or carrying dirty plates is required to earn the trust and respect of the staff.

With their exponential growth comes an ever-increasing demand for more employees - particularly to ramp up their delivery system.¬† Through their own delivery network, Amazon Flex, as well as private couriers, the online retail giant shipped an estimated 3.5 billion packages globally in 2019. To help fulfill the staggering shipping needs, Amazon is even encouraging individuals to become their delivery service partners by starting up their own logistic businesses for as little as $10,000. With Amazon‚Äôs support, these newly established companies are utilized to aid the company with its ever-increasing delivery orders. Amazon is definitely fueling the drive for these enterprises by sharing statistics of how a delivery service partner can make up to $300,000 per year if they have access to about 40 vehicles to transport packages. But what is the price of success in this high-pressure world of deliveries? What will be the strain on employees to reach the KPIs of the company? Dream Job To be able to work for Amazon is a dream to many, and job seekers actively pursue any openings with the online seller's name attached to it. Unfortunately, many who did end up landing a job with Amazon are unable to keep up with the company‚Äôs expeditious pace after discovering the demanding workload and tight schedules necessary in many roles. With over 90,000 warehouse employees and thousands more in contractual positions and serving as delivery drivers, it‚Äôs far-fetched for us to expect Amazon to please everyone. But it wouldn't hurt to at least try. We‚Äôve checked renowned sites Glassdoor, Indeed, CareerBliss and Great Place to Work for feedback from current and previous employees of Amazon and found three key points which we can all learn from to improve the retention of good hourly employees. Let‚Äôs take a deeper look at each of them. 1. More Than an Asset While this might be second nature to some companies, there are a select few which, unfortunately, disregard their employees‚Äô welfare - and Amazon might just be one of them. Employees‚Äô complaints have been ongoing for years about the long hours and short breaks. Yet, little response is given to their concerns. With pressing rules such as having a new package ‚Äúsealed and ready to go every 30 seconds‚Äù, and scheduled, monitored bathroom breaks, employee turnover is unsurprisingly high at Amazon. To make matters worse, employees also have to work a mandatory 60-hours week during the peak holiday seasons. Even with the higher wage received during this overtime, the workload is still grueling and literally back-breaking for some. Because of Jeff Bezos' commitment to what he calls, \" True Customer Obsession ,\" the focus has always been on the customer at all costs. While his slogan merely sounds like a great introduction to a commercial, he is, in fact, truly dedicated to the customers, leaving little room for focus on the employees. Couple that with data from different surveys, it becomes obvious that Amazon does indeed put their customer first, and way above its employees. Contrast this business mission with that of Southwest Airlines , \" Employees will be provided the same concern, respect, and caring attitude within the organization that they are expected to share externally with every Southwest Customer. \" - it comes with no surprise that Amazon‚Äôs employees feel mistreated or even inconsequential to their company. Though Amazon did roll out a new $15 minimum wage in late 2019, some employees still complained that the work is strenuous and even \"unrealistic\". Rather than using their workers as a means to an end, Amazon could perhaps put in more effort into cultivating a safe environment for their employees. After all, it can‚Äôt hurt to have more employees praising the company‚Äôs work culture, right? 2. Qualify, Orient, and Train One of the major themes of complaints from Amazon employees is the lack of training and onboarding for new employees. In fact, after getting hired, new employees are simply thrown into their work routine with little to no guidance. In one package delivery driver's review, he said that he was given a route and told what packages to load based on the app on his phone. After which, he had to \"drive like crazy to make all the deliveries on time.\" There is no specific training in customer service on how to handle a complaint or question posed to them by a customer. As such, drivers for Flex and other Amazon services are simply winging it, trying to figure out how to stay ahead of the workload by themselves. While it might not seem like much, given the minimal contact these delivery drivers have with the customers, you can never be too careful with your onboarding process. After all, they are still representatives of your company. One slip, and it could tarnish your company‚Äôs reputation, especially in this day and age of technology where feedback is bound to go viral depending on the severity of the complaint. Additionally, with the ongoing pandemic, training for employees could never be more emphasized on to ensure that employees are aware of the new advisories. Undoubtedly, customers will be more appreciative when their deliverymen abide by safety measures, especially in this sensitive climate.

Drop us a message to find out how you can optimize your hiring, so you can focus on planning the onboarding process for your new staff. 3. Listen to Feedback As Amazon is a worldwide conglomerate, controlling working conditions at every location will most likely pose a challenge. But it becomes easier if the company takes the time to listen to employees. Case in point - workers at a warehouse in Eagan, East Africa , complained that the stifling heat in the said warehouse, which had no air conditioning, was causing workers to feel faint and unable to work. In the US, several complaints have been made against Amazon regarding the poor working conditions amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, the company‚Äôs reluctance to provide the number of employees infected further exacerbated the issue as employees felt that their company is not being transparent with them regarding the severity of the situation. These complaints, and many other similar ones, are common in Amazon and many employees feel like they are falling on deaf ears because of the lack of action taken by the company. Typically, a big movement (i.e. protests) is required from the employees before any improvements are rolled out. Lessons Learned Business owners and leaders can learn a thing or two from the pages of Amazon's growth pains. The first is to remember that stating that employees are the company's greatest asset needs to be followed up with discernible action at the floor-level. Employees want to be treated with respect and dignity, and know that they are valued. Additionally, as a business grows, it must invest in qualifying and training new employees, giving them time to assimilate into their positions as well as the company culture. This not only boosts employees‚Äô morale but also ensures that the company‚Äôs reputation will not be hurt by a careless mistake. Finally, employees not only want to be heard, but they want to know that their feedback is valuable. Acknowledge these feedback and try to take action based on them. Mastering these three will put businesses that rely on hourly employees ahead of the competition.

Just last February, the tech giant launched a full sized grocery store, Amazon Go Grocery Store. And what better way for a store to represent Amazon than to make it as tech-savvy as possible? From cashierless stores to shopping carts that allow customers to skip that annoying checkout queue, Amazon is continually coming up with innovative ways to make their consumers‚Äô shopping experience as seamless as possible. Ever wondered how Amazon got this far in the food retail industry? Let us unpack it for you! Amazon‚Äôs Grocery Strategy The multi-prong grocery strategy of the world‚Äôs largest retailer may be perplexing at first. From the acquisition of Whole Foods Market in 2017 to bundling its grocery services with their Amazon Prime membership, one may be left wondering about the direction Amazon is taking in this competitive industry. However, this multifaceted strategy actually serves as a foundation for Amazon to determine what works best for them as a new player in the market. When Amazon first came up with Amazon Fresh, their online delivery grocery service, they were able to leverage on their huge, loyal customer base from Amazon Prime. Now, they are enticing prospective users by relying on a loss leader strategy - recently, Amazon changed their pricing model such that Prime members can now enjoy Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market grocery deliveries free of charge. And considering that the average order value of Prime members is almost double that of non-Prime members, this change is likely to work to their advantage in the long run. As for Amazon Go, Amazon does what it excels in best - technology. Spearheading the incorporation of technology in the physical grocery store, the tech giant made waves when they first entered the market with impressive automations. In addition to acquiring Whole Foods Market to make their presence larger in the industry, Amazon is also constantly expanding and innovating on their own Amazon Go stores to ensure they are staying relevant to their consumers and meeting their changing needs. The Future of Grocery Leveraging technology Amazon‚Äôs first full fledged cashierless grocery store is pretty much leading the technological aspect of the food retail industry. The store is an upgrade from its Amazon Go convenience shops as it offers a wider range of foods and products. Customers need only walk in, scan the Amazon app on a turnstile, pick out whatever they need and walk out once they are done. They will be charged for their items automatically when they leave the store. According to the 2020 Retail Consumer Behavior Poll , shoppers prefer not to interact with humans while running their errands. Evidently, Amazon acknowledges this as the entire process of shopping in their grocery stores requires zero human interaction, though there will be staff available on the ground to answer their queries. This shows that Amazon‚Äôs new grocery store not only provides shoppers with a seamless experience, it also adapts to the current consumers‚Äô taste and preferences. What‚Äôs more, human manpower could be better utilized for more complex tasks, making the organization more efficient as a whole. Technology is constantly evolving and reshaping our lives more than we know it. Thus, keeping up to date with the latest technological advancements is a never-ending endeavour. So what‚Äôs next for Amazon? Perhaps, having Alexa do your grocery shopping? Whatever it is, Amazon is definitely doing it right by being in the forefront of their technological innovations. Data-driven innovation With the introduction of its new pricing model for Amazon Fresh and the establishment of its brick-and-mortar stores, Amazon is able to collect data from both online and in-store behavior and use it to their advantage . Using the data they have in hand, they will be able to identify the offers and services a particular household values more, making it easier for them to create a highly personalized experience for their customers in the future. And if all goes well, this may just possibly act as the differentiator between them and other big players in the industry. Expansion of product offerings As mentioned earlier, Amazon first started off with Amazon Go, which was designed as a small convenience store. After which, it launched Amazon Go Grocery Store to give customers a more diverse range of products. Now, another grocery store chain is in the talks and it is even bigger than what Amazon has to offer presently. With lower operating costs due to the minimal staff needed to run its store, Amazon has the opportunity to pass on these cost savings to its consumers, giving them a competitive edge over its competitors. Pair this with the usage of technology to increase convenience for customers, Amazon may be able to stand out in this saturated industry. The important thing to note here is this - the merit of a grocery store no longer only lies in its products‚Äô prices but also how it accommodates to its consumers‚Äô changing needs . To gain a stronger foothold in the industry, Amazon has to ensure that they are able to match up to the standards of their competitors, or even outperform them. And by leveraging on their resources, they may even stand to gain a loyal following of consumers, especially via their Prime subscribers. Maneuvering Through The Pandemic Fortunately, Amazon‚Äôs nature of business gives it a unique opportunity to expand and flourish despite the pandemic which has shaken many retail industries. That being said, Amazon has added about 400,000 jobs this year to meet the increasing demands from online shopping. However, Americans are still reluctant to return to the workforce due to the uncertainties revolving around the pandemic. In fact, in an effort to attract prospective employees, Amazon even rolled out hiring bonuses as high as $3,000 to ensure they have enough manpower to get through the holiday season this year. This goes to show that even though Amazon may have thrived in the pandemic, they will still have to find a way to hire workers efficiently to meet the increasing demands of their customers. If you‚Äôre looking for a solution to streamline your hiring process during this difficult period, Workstream‚Äôs end-to-end hiring platform is here for you. We help you hire employees faster and more efficiently by filtering only quality candidates (and more!). Book a demo with our hiring specialists today to find out how we can best assist your company‚Äôs needs. How Other Grocery Brands Can Stay Competitive As Amazon introduces cutting-edge technology into its grocery stores, other brands in the industry are bound to feel pressured to incorporate such innovations in their business model as well. After all, who would want to be left behind on the technological advancements in the market? Many startups, such as Caper, are working to replicate Amazon Go‚Äôs technology in order to provide a seamless experience for shop-goers. One such product is a smartcart which allows shoppers to scan the barcode of their purchases as they fill their cart. This cart also has a scale for items which are sold by weight. The main idea behind this is to avoid the checkout queue and to minimize the time required for shoppers to fulfill their purchases. Needless to say, in order to remain relevant in the market, other grocery brands should start implementing such technology into their stores to improve their customers‚Äô shopping experience. As the industry grows to be more tech-savvy, customers will be more inclined to shop in a store which allows them to run their errands the quickest and with the least amount of human interaction. Thus, automating services wherever possible will be advantageous for other grocery brands to remain competitive. Amazon‚Äôs entrance into the food retail industry has definitely brought about changes in the shopping experience for customers. While they have not yet gained a strong foothold in the market, their future expansions and service innovations are an imminent threat to the giant players in the industry. Therefore, staying up to date with the latest innovations in the market is imperative for other grocery brands to remain significant in the industry.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 09/02/19 Finding the Sweet Spot in Minimum Wage for Your Hourly Workers Share this article There has been a lot of press as of late about raising the minimum wage for hourly workers to $15 per hour. Strong opposition as well as support for the change is keeping the topic in the forefront in media circles as well as in the world of business. It's a curious subject because it affects the future of small business and the living standards of hourly workers throughout the US. The US minimum wage, currently at $7.25 per hour, hasn't been increased since 2009. Individual states like Arkansas, which approved raising the state minimum wage from $8.50 an hour to $11 by 2021, and Missouri, which voted to incrementally raise its minimum from $7.85 to $12 in 2023, began making changes prior to any federal mandates. Companies like Walmart and Amazon have also upped their minimum wage in an effort to attract greater talent and reduce the bad press they received for paying only the current minimum. Finding the sweet spot in minimum wage is all about balancing between what a business can afford and what it can't afford not to pay. It doesn't necessarily mean a tremendous increase in wages. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the US federal minimum wage rate ranked 13th-highest in 2017, behind the UK's ($10.04) and Australia's ($13.88). Additionally, when the OECD measures minimum wages as a share of average wages, the US ranked at the bottom of the list at 24 percent, behind Mexico, Spain and Greece. But what really is the best minimum wage to pay hourly workers? Is there a rate that will attract quality workers, but not impede company profits? The answer is yes, but you have to find it. Don't worry, it's not as complicated as it sounds. Two Sides of the Coin The $15 per hour minimum wage, or what economists call efficiency wages, has stirred up controversy as well as debates between liberals and conservatives, managers and workers, and business owners and government. It has fueled walkouts by workers passionate about raising the minimum wage standard and threats of layoffs by businesses if the $15 wage is imposed. Both sides make great points, but the real test boils down to which businesses will voluntarily increase wages before the government steps in. Typically, a trend-setter business takes the lead while others watch to see if it succeeds of fails. As with most other business-related activities controlled by either federal or local governments, a mandated increase, in such a big jump in the minimum wage, will initially not be taken lightly. In October of last year, Amazon announced that it was raising employees' minimum wage to $15 per hour. However, the company also stated that in order to pay for them, they will be eliminating hourly workers' monthly bonuses and stock awards. A Bloomberg article reported that one of the theories supporting Amazon's decision to raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour is that perhaps hourly workers will rise to their wage. In other words, the workers will see the raise as incentive pay and increase productivity. It's a nice theory, and it may be the case, but it is a stretch. Amazon meticulously keeps track of its employees, monitoring every function and workers' performance. Because of that, some workers have lost their jobs because they did not meet the performance standards Amazon expected at $15 per hour. According to an article from the Economic Policy Institute , (EPI), \"Workers today who are paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour are, after adjusting for inflation, paid 29 percent less than their counterparts 50 years ago. This is despite the fact that the economy's capacity to deliver higher wages has doubled in the last 50 years, as measured by labor productivity, or the amount of output produced by workers. In the article, Ben Zipperer, an economist with EPI states that a national $15 minimum wage by 2024 is an important corrective to ensure that low-wage workers share the benefits of economic growth and that workers in every region of the country will soon need $15 per hour to maintain a modest but adequate standard of living. What Should You Pay? The economists, bleeding heart liberals, ultra-conservatives, business owners and labor leaders all have their own thoughts and feelings about the subject of increasing the minimum wage. Some use graphs and charts, others use portraits of homeless single mothers, while still others cry for the need of less government intervention. Many provide statistics that supposedly prove that the economy will be better (or worse, depending on which side), for increasing the minimum wage substantially. But for many business leaders, finding the magical sweet spot of the minimum wage to pay for hourly workers is more of an art than science. It is more about taking the pulse of your current economic market, and labor market, to determine what the company can afford to pay vs. what it would take to attract and keep quality employees. A FoxBusinessNews article found the following businesses raised the hourly worker pay above the current mandated minimum wage rate over the past year: Amazon-$15 per hour Costco-$14 per hour Target-$13 per hour Walmart-$11 per hour CVS-$11 per hour Many companies that are increasing their minimum wage are doing so based on the current job market, trying to retain hourly workers. Other businesses are considering increasing the wage due to pressures from outside the business. According to the Fox piece, Genna Gent, Vice President of Government Relations for McDonalds, wrote to the restaurant association stating that an increase in the minimum wage should be phased in, and that all industries should be treated the same way. This is after McDonald's baulked at increasing the standard to $15. It will be interesting to see how the Walmarts and Amazons of the world fare with their recent wage hikes, but studies have shown that increasing wages is an incentive that provides greater productivity, at least in the short term. Answering the question of what you should pay your hourly workers can be tricky. Many variables will need to be considered before determining what that magic number will be. These include: Current market rate for hourly workers What your industry pays for hourly workers What your competition is paying hourly workers What you can realistically afford to pay hourly workers A great place to start is the Bureau of Labor Statistics site. There you can find wages for over 800 occupations in 400 industries, by state and metropolitan areas. Use these figures as your starting point then whittle it down using your market area and good old-fashioned gut feeling. Minimum Wage is Just a Standard The Raise the Wage Act currently in the House of Representatives (H.R. 15) and the Senate (S.1242) will increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024. While this will be a law with hefty consequences if violated, there are no penalties for paying more than the minimum. In fact, to attract the best hourly employees before the competition does, it may be wise to consider finding a way to stay ahead of the bare minimum. Raising your minimum wage too high can result in having to make cuts in other areas, (like Amazon), eliminating jobs and some benefits. Before simply increasing your minimum wage for hourly workers, take some time out and weigh all the costs involved. See if instead of increasing the wage across the board, that you find a way to pay for performance only. Pay more for your outstanding performers to reward them and to send a message to others that it is possible to make more money by increasing productivity. Be creative and play with the numbers to find your sweet spot and be sure to communicate any wage hikes to your team members.

While unemployment levels run at record levels in many business sectors, other businesses are urgently recruiting to hire staff for positions that have emerged or grown as a result of the pandemic. The retail and catering industries are good examples where customer demand for home delivery has led to major recruitment drives for hourly workers to pick, pack and deliver products. However, COVID-19 hasn‚Äôt just changed the type of workers who are now in demand, it has also changed the way companies recruit and onboard new staff. Out go face-to-face interviews at the workplace and in their place come virtual recruiting processes. As a result, recruitment professionals are having to quickly adapt to new ways of attracting and interviewing hourly workers in a virtual world. And, that‚Äôs while they‚Äôre also struggling with the challenge of managing the transition of employees to home working and dealing with layoffs or short-time working. Technology Transforms Recruitment Fortunately, there‚Äôs a wide range of recruitment software available to support virtual recruitment and professionals are finding innovative ways to reconfigure the hiring process. According to Fortune Business Insights , the global market for recruitment software is forecast to grow from $1753 million in 2017 to $3095 million by 2025. The continuing economic crisis is likely to accelerate adoption even further. This type of software helps businesses automate and manage recruitment electronically. It helps recruitment professionals filter, rank and store applicants‚Äô data. It can simplify the process of tracking the progress of an application and automates the process of job postings on various job portals. Recruitment software is an essential tool for virtual recruitment. It speeds up many of the time-consuming administrative and analytical tasks, leaving recruiters free to focus on candidates. Contactless Hiring is the New Normal While the administrative tasks may be simpler, the real problem lies in the interview phase. Social distancing and other health measures during the pandemic make face-to-face interviews a high-risk process. So, for individual roles, candidates can join an interview contactlessly via videoconference . Recruiters can also put together online assessments that test applicants‚Äô resume , skills and suitability before moving to the interview stage. More sophisticated programs incorporate artificial intelligence to rank applicants‚Äô performance. Although this type of process works well for recruitment of individuals or small numbers of candidates, it is less suitable for hiring large numbers of hourly workers, which is the challenge facing businesses like retail, catering or logistics. Virtual interviews by video are still at the heart of the process, but recruiters are loosening some of their normal procedures and standards to streamline the process and get workers in place. A number of supermarkets, for example, are allowing new recruits to start working before the company has received and accepted all references and background checks. Other companies are offering new recruits a drive-in facility where they can confirm identities, take drug tests and complete I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification forms. Some companies working in the same or related industries are sharing resources and providing information to each other on potential recruits who might be facing layoff or furlough from their organization. Overcoming Barriers to Recruitment According to recent research, American companies had an average turnover rate of 22% in 2018. Given the high number of layoffs and employee turnover, it would be reasonable to assume that there is a large pool of labor just waiting to be recruited. However, many people are reluctant to return to the workplace, citing fears about risks to health during the continuing pandemic. That makes it essential for employers to ensure the workplace is safe for employees and to communicate the facts clearly in their recruitment advertising and virtual interviews. They need to spell out in detail the measures they are taking to protect workers by describing changes in the workplace, their cleaning processes, use of PPE and other healthcare initiatives. One factor that has not proved a barrier to recruitment is distance. Virtual recruitment eliminates the barrier of distance and gives businesses the opportunity to recruit from a geographically wider pool of talent. And, if the job doesn‚Äôt require the candidate to work on site, that gives recruiters even greater scope to hire people from any part of the country, or overseas, who will work remotely. Related: The Highest Minimum Wages in US - Federal and State Minimum Wages 2020 Hiring Contractors As an alternative to hiring hourly workers on a permanent basis, some companies are using contractors to fill vacancies until ‚Äònormal‚Äô conditions return. The average hourly pay for an Independent Contractor in the United States is $26.93 an hour as of Nov 17, 2020. While this may succeed as a short-term measure, many commentators are concerned that contractors may not be given the critical protections and benefits enjoyed by employees, such as sick pay, paid holidays, unemployment insurance and reasonable notice periods. Hiring contractors can also pose a risk to employers as the IRS may decide that a contractor should be reclassified as an employee, leading to possible fines and surcharges of various taxes and other deductions. That being said, there are also tax benefits of using contractors, which could be beneficial in times where businesses are struggling with cash flow . For example, Bizfilings state that by classifying workers as independent contractors, employers may be able to avoid responsibility under: The Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) or Social Security tax The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) Workers' compensation Retirement plans Examples of jobs that businesses can hire independent contractors for: Company driver Call center representative Customer service role Remote travel advisor Virtual assistant Personal assistant Content writer IT / Technical support Workstream Can Help We‚Äôre deeply involved in virtual recruitment and can help you source, engage, interview and onboard quality candidates using our recruitment automation tools and 2-way text messaging.

They focus on engaging their salaried employees, as they usually put more time and effort into finding, hiring, and training them. The same holds true for hourly manufacturing workers. Manufactured workers include welders, technicians, engineers, assemblers, and much more. What managers often don't realize is that hourly workers are the backbone of the business‚Äîthe ones bearing the brunt of heavy labor, in charge of completing most of the daily tasks, and responsible for providing¬†excellent customer experiences. And with approximately 15 million manufacturing workers employed in 2019 , that‚Äôs a significant chunk of the population that‚Äôs often overlooked and unappreciated. One way to keep your manufacturing workers fulfilled is to keep them engaged. Employee engagement is key to decreasing turnover, motivating staff, and keeping operations running smoothly . Here's what you can do to effectively engage your hourly manufacturing workers and make them a part of your team. Give them a sense of purpose When your hourly manufacturing employees have a sense of purpose in your organization, they will go above and beyond their assigned tasks to turn your company into a successful one. They will want to contribute more in order to feel meaningful and for you to recognize their efforts. How can you make their work meaningful? Through clear and effective communication. Communicate with all your manufacturing employees professionally yet in a friendly manner, because you're all partners working towards a common goal. There was a study by Gallup on factory worker motivation that showed that hourly workers in a factory don't really care about the organizational mission, but rather about giving back to the community. If you could communicate to them how their work can contribute to the community, you could motivate them better and significantly increase their engagement. Build meaningful relationships Building strong relationships with your hourly workers is a fantastic way to increase their engagement and retention. When they see you as a friend rather than merely a manager, they will definitely perform much better. Strong working relationships also foster company loyalty‚Äî workers in a factory who feel part of the community are more motivated to stay on, regardless of whether they get a better offer or another opportunity to work elsewhere. It's crucial that you create enjoyable experiences so that they feel great when they clock in and build products. Friendly relationships are your best bet for achieving that. What's also very important is being available to them. Being there are crucial moments when they need you is what will show them that you care and value them. One step in the right direction is to also keep them in the loop on issues that will directly impact them. Keep them updated, just like you do with your salaried employees, and they will start seeing you as a partner and a friend. It will boost their morale and create a wonderful workplace culture that they will not want to leave. Involve them in Problem-Solving Processes It's a very common practice among business owners and managers to ask their salaried employees for help when coming up with solutions to various problems and creating a company strategy. That's completely normal, as they are often knowledge workers with plenty of experience and expertise regarding various business-related issues. However, this doesn't mean that you should overlook hourly employees and the strengths they have to offer. Perhaps some of them have a groundbreaking solution to a particular problem. After all, they are the ones engaging in numerous day-to-day operations or at the heart of your manufacturing processes, so they most likely have first-hand information regarding improvements that need to be made or concerns that need to be addressed. That's precisely why you should give them a seat at the table. Tap into their knowledge and really hear what they have to say. Give them a chance to really be a part of your team and introduce some change in your organization, the change that they‚Äôve already brought about on their level. Their hands-on experience may just be what your company has needed all along. Including them in your strategizing process will give them a sense of purpose and motivate them to continue contributing to your company. Another study by Gallup on hourly vs. salaried workers' job satisfaction shows that 46% of hourly workers are satisfied with recognition for work accomplishments. So give the recognition that‚Äôs due them for their hard work and their invaluable contributions to your problem-solving process. Open the Door to Promotions If your manufacturing workers don't have an opportunity to grow in your company and actually build a career, chances are they will simply leave you after a certain period of time. If you don't allow them to grow, they'll find a place where they can. The aforementioned Gallup study on job satisfaction of hourly and salaried workers also shows that only 35% of hourly workers are satisfied with opportunities for promotion . With this statistic in mind, make sure each and every hourly worker has a chance to build a future at your company. Some may have completely different career aspirations and your company is only a stepping stone towards their goals, but it may not be the case with all of them. Take the time to talk to them and find out who would like to build an in-house career. Once you know that, lead them on a path to promotion. That's a very good incentive that can lead to lifetime loyalty and considerably improve your entire organization. If you only focus on investing time and effort into your salaried workers and disregard your hourly employees and their needs, your company may never reach the level of engagement you're looking for. Only when you fully recognize your hourly workers as valuable contributors to your company's success, as they definitely are, will you be able to truly grow.

Asking some general questions about the candidate to get to know them better should be harmless, right? Well, it depends. With discriminatory practices (intentional, or not) still being prevalent and more studies bringing light to such issues, fair recruiting and interview processes have become more of a priority. As a hiring manager, there are some lines you definitely shouldn't cross, especially when it comes to interview questions. Not only can doing so be disrespectful, but one wrong move could also result in a costly lawsuit. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) uses a guiding principle to decide whether or not an interviewer should be asking a question: \"Can the employer demonstrate a job-related necessity for asking the question?\" The EEOC will use the intent of the question and the utility of the obtained information to decide if any discrimination has occurred. The only times when discriminatory employment practices are permitted is when a person's \"religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.\" For example, hiring a female janitor to clean the women‚Äôs bathroom. However, hiring managers and recruiters must realize that something as seemingly innocent as a question on demographic information could end up with an impending costly lawsuit. Here are 13 topics that you should avoid asking a candidate about during an interview, unless absolutely necessary: 1. Disabilities According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), employers are limited in making disability-related inquiries during the pre-offer, post-offer, and employment stages. These are questions that elicit information about a disability. These include questions like, ‚ÄúHave you ever had a disability?‚Äù or questions on the prescription medicine they are taking. 2. Genetic Information Under Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), hiring companies and other employment-related organizations such as employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor-management training and apprenticeship programs are heavily restricted from requesting for, requiring, or purchasing genetic information. 3. Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation Gender identity and sexual orientation have been explicitly mentioned as bases for discriminatory practices. If knowing the candidate‚Äôs gender identity and sexual orientation has absolutely nothing to do with the job, then it‚Äôs best not to ask about them. 4. Religion In general, questions about an applicant‚Äôs religious affiliation or beliefs are viewed as non-job-related under federal law. However, if religion is a bona fide occupational qualification, employment based on religion is permitted. For example, the employment of religious teachers in religious educational institutions. 5. Race and Ethnicity As with gender identity and sexual orientation, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 also prohibits discrimination based on race. Questions regarding race and ethnicity should not be asked about unless it is a BFOQ. 6. Military Discharge While not exactly illegal, employers are strongly advised against asking related questions as EEOC has said that basing hiring decisions solely on military discharge status violates Title VII as it has been found to work against the African-American community in particular. 7. Educational Requirements It‚Äôs normal for jobs to require a minimum level of education. After all, the educational certificate does imply that the applicant has the basic level of knowledge necessary to perform some basic job functions. But if the requirements are higher than what is needed to successfully perform the job, it may violate Title VII as it can potentially and disproportionately exclude certain racial groups. 8. Marital and Family Status Such questions have the potential to violate Title VII as they may be seen as evidence of intent to discriminate against people such as women with children, pregnant women, or single parents. 9. Age Asking the interviewee about when they graduated high school, or their date of birth could be seen as a form of age discrimination. If necessary, candidates could be asked to furnish their proof of age or mention that hiring is subject to age verification. 10. Language Some jobs may require candidates with the ability to speak or write certain languages. It‚Äôs crucial for such questions to be worded distinctively. Ask the candidate what languages they speak and write fluently, if required by the job, instead of asking for their native language, as it could be considered as national origin discrimination. 11. Salary History Although it isn't uncommon for companies to ask for the last drawn salary of an individual, it could be seen as gender discrimination and may even violate state laws. Rather than basing their pay off their previous salary, ask for their salary expectations for the position. After all, candidates should obtain remuneration based on the value of their experience to your company, rather than calculated based on their previous paycheck. 12. Financial History Questions relating to debt and financial health could be justified for positions involving significant amounts of cash or financial accounts. However, it‚Äôs also a form of discrimination towards those with lower incomes and is a gray area that should be avoided if possible. 13. Health and Physical Abilities Enquiring about a candidate‚Äôs smoking and drinking habits to more personal information like height and weight or past illnesses could also be seen as a form of discrimination. Instead, ask about their ability to perform specific tasks required by the job description. Even though employers do not have any ill intent when seemingly asking certain types of questions, it can be perceived as discrimination. Here are some tips and guiding principles which should be considered while crafting interview questions, to prevent these sticky situations. Know What Should be Avoided Steer clear from asking sensitive information (like all those mentioned above). Conduct thorough checks on all interview questions prior to the interview, and stick strictly to the questions. Recruiters and hiring managers should not be given the freedom to ask any additional questions that are not included on the list. Keep to the Essentials Ask only questions that are important and necessary for the job. All questions should be directly related to the job descriptions, with the sole purpose of determining if the candidate has sufficient skills required for the job at hand. Ask the Same Questions For a fair and just interview process, all candidates should be asked the same questions. That being said, the questions should also be relevant to all candidates. If otherwise, do take time to review and determine if it should be replaced with another. (If adjustments need to be made, be sure to avoid asking unnecessary questions unless they are BFOQs.)

I was going to embark on a new journey, and I was excited, yet worried at the same time. Attending graduate school would mean a lot of learning, experiences, and fun. But I also knew that I needed to be able to pay for the hefty school fees, living costs, and more. Therefore, I quickly spoke to my seniors from school, did some research, and started applying for hourly jobs throughout MIT and Harvard that would allow me to generate the income needed to pay for my school fees. Reflecting back, the hourly jobs that I worked on in my first two years in the United States was instrumental in enforcing my understanding of hard work, grit, and paying back. At the same time, I was able to improve my personal skill sets , including public speaking, mentoring, language skills, and more. It was an enriching experience working hourly jobs. I had an amazing time working hourly jobs to see myself through MIT and Harvard and I would love to share my experiences with you. Here are the different hourly jobs that I did while I was in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 1. I worked as an hourly tour guide for Harvard Student Agencies There are thousands of tourists that show up at the Harvard yard every week. They come from China, Korea, Japan, Europe, and more. I wanted to have an experience that would allow me to improve my public speaking skills, meet new people and introduce Harvard to potential future students (most tour guides came with parents, who wanted their children to one day attend Harvard, and the children themselves.) In order to get up to speed, I needed to fill up a paper application form from Harvard Student Agencies (which took me 2 hours), trek all the way to the office to submit the form (wish Workstream existed then!), and do manual paper on-boarding. At the same time, I needed to memorize the three lies of John Harvard , the \"founding father\" for the university, learn about the different routes of the school, and shadow a few of the more experienced tour guides. After over 10 hours of in-person training, I was ready to go! I started working for $25 per hour for the job and had a range of fun experiences from showing high school students from Japan to bringing a group of professionals on a fun tour of Harvard. 2. I served as a resident advisor at MIT with one of the fraternity/living groups This was one of the most memorable experiences of my time in Boston, where I served as a resident advisor for Epsilon Theta , or \"ET\", a fraternity of a co-living group within MIT. I was provided with a room and board, lived with 25 brilliant MIT undergraduates majoring in computer science, physics, and mathematics, and learned a bit more about engineering, American culture, and living with really smart people. As a resident advisor, I needed to organize activities (of course I organized bi-weekly basketball sessions), mentor the students, and be a friend whenever they needed a listening ear. During my time at Epsilon Theta, I met many good friends. This includes living next to a student who came to MIT when he was just 15 years old (he's now doing his Ph.D. at Stanford at age 19), going for morning runs with the students, and talking about programming. 3.¬†I worked as an hourly translator for Harvard Business School professors At the same time, I signed up to be a translator at Harvard Business School for several professors who were hosting professionals from China. There is a huge interest in classes at Harvard Business School with regard to finance, law and economics. I conducted research online and found one of the school job boards which was looking for fluent Mandarin speakers. I then went through a 3-round interview process and got the job. The job was great as it had an hourly wage of $50 per hour due to the technical translation needed. I put in hours preparing for the various translation jobs in between my classes and was able to save money to cover my school fees. 4. I signed up as an advisor and mentor for Harvard college students Finally, I also signed up as an advisor at Harvard‚Äôs Adams House - the house of many famous alumni including Henry Kissinger, Andy Borowitz, and more. As an advisor, I met many students whom I count as friends today, including Noah (who is an amazing engineer presently), Christina (who used to compete in the Olympics for the United States in figure skating), and Edward (an outstanding tech entrepreneur today). I worked office hours where I would provide career guidance, feedback on resumes, and set goals for these students. Juggling 4 hourly jobs during the time that I attended graduate school and taking classes, while at the same time starting a logistics startup at Harvard Innovation Lab and figuring out the next steps in life was a challenge. But it was also fulfilling, exciting, and laid a strong foundation for me. Both of my parents were hourly workers and I grew up in my family learning about the different challenges an hourly worker faces. To be able to see myself through graduate school by taking on different hourly jobs and learning new skills was the very experience that inspired me to start Workstream , an automated hiring platform for companies hiring hourly workers. I love to trade stories and hear about your hourly job workers. Was there a time that you, too, worked as an hourly worker?

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/30/19 Why Hiring Great People is Key for the Restaurant Business Share this article Chris Bredesen's passion for the local restaurant industry was instilled in him at a young age. Growing up in Southern California, Bredesen learned the ins-and-outs of the business from his father, a successful restaurateur with over 40 years of experience. Chris was a professional Longboard surfer during his High School days, allowing him to travel the globe in pursuit of the perfect wave. His travels allowed him to better understand different cultures and their unique cuisines. After graduating from USC, then with an MBA from Pepperdine University, Bredesen followed his father's footsteps and over the course of the past six years, opened and invested in seven restaurants. Bredesen and partner, Allen Sanford, started the successful gastropub concept The Rockefeller in 2011, with their first location opening its doors in Hermosa Beach. Soon after, Bredesen purchased Captain Kidd's Fish Market & Restaurant, a struggling restaurant which had been a South Bay staple since 1976. He transformed the local landmark into a hugely successful restaurant. In 2013, he joined forces with Allen Sanford once again as the two launched The Rockefeller's second location in Manhattan Beach. Later that year, they partnered with Allen's brother, Jed Sanford, and together, opened Hermosa's Dia de Campo. Primo Italia was opened in late 2016, and is known to locals as the best new Italian restaurant in the entire South Bay. Finally in late 2018 they opened their 3 rd Rockefeller location in Redondo Beach, California. New locations for The Rockefeller , Captain Kidds and Primo are still being discussed and evaluated at this time, with the goal of expanding each brand throughout Southern California. Chris oversees the management team at each location. From directing the managers, to analyzing numbers and projections, to instituting protocols and quality checks, he governs his business with the mantra, \"to set up my employees for success.\" On a more casual note, Chris also enjoys traveling (to remote surf spots), being with his family, and making his brands the best they can be each and every day. Q: What professional accomplishments are you most proud of since you started the Rockefeller project? Chris: When I think about my professional accomplishments, I will always come back with the same answer: Creating jobs for great people.We have such amazing people that work in our organization, and it is their hard work and dedication that has allowed the Rockefeller Brand (and our other brands) to grow and succeed. Specifically talking about the Rockefeller Brand , it is not an easy feat to open a restaurant and have it be successful for almost a decade. On top of that, it is even rarer to expand into multiple other locations and have them be just as successful. I am thankful everyday, but I am also proud of our work ethics, as we constantly improve the brand inside and out. Q: What is one piece of advice that you will give someone running a restaurant? Chris: When someone asks me for advice about running a restaurant, it is normally a very long conversation as there are so many moving parts in the restaurant industry. But if I had to only give one piece of advice, it would be to hire great people . You will never succeed if you're not surrounded by \"A players\" . Spend time, hire correctly and hire people that you can rely on to make your business better than your competitors'. By doing this, you will allow yourself the time to fix other issues. (improve operations, menu updates, repairs, marketing, etc.) Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Did you know that you can also hire \"A players\", yet save time? With Workstream's Job Board Integrations , put your brand in front of candidates in over 25,000 different job boards with a single click. Filtering through video resumes is also effective in helping to judge a candidate's personality and suitability for the job more accurately, rather than screening through lots of resumes. Find candidates with characters that fit well with your team! Q: What is the biggest challenge you have met in your career? Chris: The biggest challenge I have met in my career was in the first few months of then opening of our first restaurant back in 2011. We thought we had it all figured out, but unfortunately, we did not. The build out was beautiful, the beer was cold, the staff was solid, but the food was not up to standard. The issue was that we relied on our head chef to handle the food menu, and we put all our trust in his decisions. It took up 3-4 months to find a new chef, change the menu, and convince customers to come back and give us another shot. It was the worst 6 months in my career and there were times I was not sure if this industry was for me. What I learned was: Hire Great People and Systems are the key We put detailed recipe books together, we costed everything, we put in the time meticulously coming up with the menu. This was so that we could immediately make a better hire, and they could take over kitchen operations seamlessly without us starting from scratch. Q: What are some challenges or trends you see in hiring today? Chris: Hiring today, specifically in California, has many challenges. The economy seems to be firing on all cylinders and that actually makes hiring a bit more difficult, as people are already working and the pool of potential hires is smaller than normal. The goal is to build a business that allows people a good paying job, in a positive environment, with opportunities for growth. Furthermore, with the minimum wage increasing each year, the cost of business is increasing drastically, so we have to adapt. The answer is not to just increase prices, because that is not fair to the customer. Instead, adapt and figure out solutions to the problems. We have started giving the kitchen staff part of the tips, which allows us to be more competitive in terms of pay and also in hiring quality staff. Another challenge is the legal issues in California surrounding hiring. We have spent years getting our hiring paperwork and HR team to where it is today. When you have great systems, you hire great people and your ability to be successful increases drastically. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Beyond paperwork, why not also try out paperless onboarding ? With free-to-use templates and electronic signatures, capture all required data seamlessly in the system. There will also be trigger alerts sent out if the paperwork is incomplete. Furthermore, integrated background check vendors and HR / payroll platforms provide an all-in-one hiring system that help in improving recruiting efficiency. Q: Have you ever had an hourly job? If yes, please share with us your experience. Chris: I have had a ton of hourly jobs growing up. My main hourly job was a LA County Ocean Lifeguard. In addition to making ocean rescues and performing emergency medical tasks, I learned the value of hard work. Doing what I do now, I look back and have great respect for the Captains and Lieutenants that I worked with and all the hourly personnel they had to manage. It was a great time in my life with a bit less stress than today. It's a different ball game when you worked for years to save up enough money to invest in a business and you HAVE to have it succeed. Only getting a paycheck if the business is successful changes your mindset. Pave your road to success with what Workstream has to offer! Schedule a chat with us to learn more!

People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.\" - Franklin D. Roosevelt In this week‚Äôs newsletter, we look at the jobs data in some reopened areas, the impact of the pandemic on female workers, and what experts think jobs will look like in a post-coronavirus world. Reopenings lead to more hiring. Incrementally. Statistics site fivethirtyeight.com recently put out some data on how the gradual reopening of states are trending in terms of unemployment and hiring numbers. While the entire article is worth a read for all of the context behind these data points, there are two things to point out: 1) continued unemployment insurance claims fell in May for the first time since early March; and 2) total job postings on Indeed have increased in each of the past three weeks. It's good news, but not great news. 538 points out that jobs volume on May 22nd was 35% worse than a year ago, but if companies are looking for signs-of-life in the American economy and jobs market, we are seeing it. But the numbers don't immediately point to states reopening as the driver of the hiring increases. Of the four states that reopened the earliest, two have seen job post increases and two haven't. There are more positive signs of hiring in the 11 recently opened states, but it's still a bit early to tell how much of a jobs surge they'll see. The Takeaway : Job losses may have hit a bottom if continued unemployment claim numbers and job post numbers are signals, which is great news. But signs also point to a slow recovery that's inexorably tied to what the virus does in the next few months. In short, be optimistic, but be diligent as well. Millennial women are seeing an unfair share of job loss. The oldest Millennials are almost 40 now (where does the time go?) and with a generation larger in number than Baby Boomers now in middle-age, it's no wonder that they make up the largest proportion of job holders. Unfortunately, it almost means this generation, which already lived through the 2008 downturn, is being hit hard with unemployment. Especially women . Call it a \" shecession \" if you will, as women made up 55% of recent layoffs and are also being hired at a lower rate than their male counterparts. The main reason for this? Child rearing. Millennial women are the most likely age group to get pregnant, and trying to find a new job while about to, having, or just having had a child is not easy. They also do the majority of the homeschooling during quarantine. These are all incredibly important jobs to do, but also puts women at a disadvantage when they want to return to corporate jobs post-pandemic. The Takeaway : Hiring managers should always strive to hire women who may have had to step away from the workforce due to family. Now it's doubly important to be aware of diversity when hiring for millennial women who have missed out on months of work due to both family obligations in the midst of the pandemic. Experts see virtual jobs being here to stay. Fast Company interviewed the chief economist at Glassdoor and a VP of product for LinkedIn, and they both agreed that remote work and \"virtual jobs\" will be the new normal going forward. A couple choice quotes: \"The share of remote job postings compared to all postings on LinkedIn has grown about 91% from the first week of March to the last week of April. A lot of businesses are now considering, what if this remote working thing just works?\" - Kiran Prasad \"You're also going to see more hiring outside the big metro [cities], in the short-term. There are lots of pools of affordable workers. Any place there's a good university with a STEM program, there are pools of young tech workers that could be accessed if companies have more willingness to hire remotely.\" - Andrew Chamberlain The Takeaway : The thought of a decentralized business might be frightening to the old guard, but younger workers are digital nomads by design. With an exodus of young adults from the most expensive cities like NYC ( see our previous newsletter ), a \"business\" may no longer be a building, but rather an idea connected by remote workers.

We need to de-parent, de-gender, and de-age the perception of the flexible worker.‚Äù - Cali Williams Yost In this week‚Äôs post, we examine what a future of remote workers means for big cities, discover a new way to interview candidates gaining traction, and consider the idea of building a future of good jobs to replace the ones that won't come back. Location, location, location... doesn't matter anymore. Jury's out on how premature of a trend this may be, but those who can (ie. have the means) seem to be leaving expensive cities. A new report showed that 5% of New York City's population, which is about 420,000 people, left the city over the span of the last 2 months. Most of those leaving are in the upper tier of earners, in the 1% to 5% range. While many of these people fleeing the city are likely taking temporary measures for safety and health reasons, many analysts think that it could be a permanent move for anyone who can work remotely. And as more jobs become remote access due to the ongoing pandemic, the less reason there is to take up residence in expensive metro cities like New York. In fact, a recent survey by Blind showed that \" 69% of New Yorkers in the tech and finance field would consider relocating if they knew they could work from home permanently.\" The Takeaway : Hiring managers, take note. We may be at the dawn of a new workforce that not only doesn't want to be in the same office, but maybe not even the same city anymore. Remote working may become the new standard, turning places like New York into \"working class\" cities all over again. Are you ready? Job interviews on demand, or how you'll learn to stop worrying and love the self-tape. Remember video dating? Job interviews might look similar to that in the coming months. A recent article in Forbes highlighted the new promise of \"job interviews on demand.\" In essence, candidates will record video of themselves answering pre-determined (and potentially pre-recorded) questions from the employer, submitting them at any time, to be reviewed at any time. It's 24/7 hiring made real. For businesses who have been forced to embrace video interviews , they are already coming to know the efficiencies involved. This strange idea of not-real-time interviews seems just the next logical step, especially when trying to hire rapidly. Recorded interviews mean no scheduling, no commuting, and can be effective ways to screen at least the first round of applicants . And keep in mind, Hollywood has been casting by self-tape for decades now, and it's worked just fine for them. The Takeaway : This pandemic may permanently alter our sense of \"how business is done\" when it comes to hiring. In an era of online dating, is it truly that strange to hire an employee with a submitted video resume and interview? It will be interesting to see if traditional businesses can pivot in this direction, or whether there really is no replacing true human interaction and a firm handshake. The old jobs may not come back. Might as well make better jobs. Since researchers are estimating that 42% of pandemic-induced layoffs will be permanent , a slew of old jobs are going away and will either be replaced with a universal basic income (unlikely) or millions of new jobs. In the latter case, many are calling on businesses and the government to take this opportunity to rebuild American jobs better, stronger, faster . A piece in Harvard Business Review expounded on the current \"bad jobs\" system where employees were undertrained, underpaid, and underwhelmed with their work lives. This was bad for businesses too, often facing high turnover rates and slim margins. So instead of, say, retail jobs being spurned for always being bad, why can't there be good retail jobs ? The piece pointed to Costco as an example of a company providing good retail jobs, and they're not wrong . Costco employees are generally some of the happiest workers in their industry. The Takeaway : This pandemic revealed the problems in the American workforce, but with a paradigm shift in jobs looming, businesses can remodel the next decade or more of what good jobs are. Hiring good people with good benefits is going to be a cornerstone of this work revolution. Store owners need to be ready to hire smart to survive the future. Need help hiring the right people?

According to the National Restaurant Association, 110,000 places have been closed indefinitely or for good. Additionally, the restaurant industry performed way below its pre-pandemic forecast , with total industry sales being $240 billion less than the projected amount. While this is understandably so given the current circumstances, there is no doubt that such a performance will still have an impact on the industry in 2021, even if sales are expected to grow significantly this year. Nevertheless, every cloud has its silver lining. And in the case of the quick-service restaurant (QSR) industry, the accelerated digitalization of its operations is definitely it. While it is true that some restaurants struggled to stay afloat during these turbulent times, there were others that flourished. The latter were those who either already digitized their services or have the financial capabilities to shift their services to a more contactless form. In this article, we will be unpacking some of the ways digitalization has changed the way restaurants operate and why this is likely to be the new norm even after the pandemic ends (which we really hope is soon!). Read on to find out the important role digitalization plays in the restaurant industry today and how you, as a QSR or franchise owner, can get your business to thrive by digitizing it. Digitalization in the ‚ÄòNew Normal‚Äô When the pandemic struck, our way of life changed more than we expected it to. For the QSR industry, digitalization played a big part in helping them stay afloat despite the circumstances. So how did the restaurant industry use it to adapt to the new normal ? Let‚Äôs find out. Replacement of In-store Services When it comes to food, hygiene becomes the utmost priority for most consumers. Coupled with the pandemic, it is safe to say that most customers will be warier when buying take-out for their meals. To ensure that their followers don‚Äôt lose faith in them, restaurants, and the likes, had to take the extra steps in keeping the virus at bay. Apart from keeping their restaurant compound clean, they also had to ensure that all forms of dine-in services were halted so that they were in line with the government‚Äôs guidelines. Despite this being a huge hurdle to overcome for most restaurants, those that already had an online presence found it easier to navigate this new challenge. For example, McAlister‚Äôs Deli‚Äôs digital sales were twice as much as it was the previous year. The QSR spent most of last year leveraging technology to improve their service structure and even managed to increase their loyalty base by 7x during the pandemic. Hopdoddy, whose off-premise services made up 12% of its business before the pandemic, also used this opportunity to revamp its digital presence. The burger bar is even looking to develop other tools to make their guest experience better. One thing‚Äôs for sure, digitalization has helped restaurants expand their services to more than just dine-in options so that customers can still enjoy their food from the comforts of their own home. Some of these services include: Contactless Payment Kiosks for Contactless Ordering Direct or Third-Party Delivery Services Online and In-App Ordering Loyalty Programs Drive-thru Curbside Pickup HR Processes As physical contact was minimized wherever possible, this also meant that most of us had to work from home, a term we are all too familiar with in the past year. And while there were no in-store customers, more staff are needed to support the new services added to the restaurant. In times like this, hiring the right people is more important than ever to ensure that your business is able to run smoothly. With stringent measures in place, however, it can be difficult to source for and hire the right people for the job. This is where digitalization in the form of hiring software tools comes in to make recruitment easier for you. At Workstream, we offer a suite of hiring tools, including an applicant tracking system that allows you to get a holistic view of your candidates, and a smart screening feature so that you select only from the best pool of applicants. Interviews, onboarding, and job training for your prospective employees can also be done remotely to ensure that safe distancing measures are adhered to. What‚Äôs more, most of the hiring processes can be automated so that you can focus on running your restaurant! If you are looking for ways to streamline your hiring process, reach out to us at Workstream ! Our hiring specialist will gladly provide you with a free consultation on how we can best meet your hiring needs. Impact of Digitalization Better Understanding of Consumers For most businesses, minimizing physical interactions was the priority when the pandemic started. Despite this, companies were able to draw a closer connection to their customers. While this might seem counterintuitive, the availability of mass data due to digitalization has allowed restaurants to understand their customers better even without their physical presence. As a result, brands are able to leverage their popular menu on the front and center of their product displays. Collecting consumer data also means that companies can better personalize what the customers see on their app when they are making a second purchase, for example. And since you know what a particular customer is into, you are able to upsell your items more effectively, resulting in a higher average order value. Increased Efficiency Needless to say, the incorporation of technology in our day-to-day activities has significantly increased our efficiency in accomplishing tasks. And the same can be said for restaurant operations. With digitalization, customers can make faster purchases due to the availability of contactless payments. Moreover, they are able to skip the long queues which are, otherwise, unavoidable. Providing prompt and efficient service contributes to the guest experience and if your restaurant is able to give exceptional service to your customers, they will likely remain loyal to your brand in the long run. With so many competitors in the scene these days, gaining a few more loyal customers wouldn't hurt. Most importantly, using digital platforms to help you with your hiring strategy and other backend processes lets you save precious time. Especially in the QSR industry, where everything seems to happen at the speed of lightning, having automated tools allow the managers to focus on more important tasks, i.e. actually running the restaurant. Beyond COVID-19 The digitalization of the restaurant industry may seem unprecedented but it was something that was bound to happen in the near future nevertheless. We‚Äôre just seeing the accelerated version of it - which, if we‚Äôre being honest, works entirely in our favor. After all, it has opened up other sales channels that did not exist before and increased our efficiency by so much more. As the pandemic situation improves, we will likely see dine-in services slowly revert to how it was before. This, however, does not mean that the technological advancements we have made are for naught. Since most restaurants have adopted a digitalized strategy, you would probably need to do the same to stay abreast with your competitors. In fact, expect to see even more digital innovation in the restaurant industry in the years to come, while the current digitalization becomes the norm. ‚Äú2021‚Äôs big disruption for restaurant operators will not be an unforeseen pandemic, but rather failure to anticipate the required shift in digital transformation strategies needed to compete in a rapidly changing landscape .‚Äù - Dipesh Hinduja , Senior IT Manager and Technical Architect at Stratix For more insights and updates, subscribe to our blog .

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 09/02/19 Here are 4 Description Tips I Learned from Working at Indeed Share this article Today I will share some quick insider info from my experience working as a senior account executive at Indeed. I worked with around ~1,000 different companies during my time at Indeed so I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. These tips are for your average job post on Indeed for your average job seeker on Indeed: if you are hiring for some niche senior role then not only do you already probably know what you're doing, but these tips don't apply to you. Hopefully this gives you some insight into the average job seeker on Indeed and how to tailor your posts to them. 1. Candidates are not reading your job description Unfortunately, that job description you spent the afternoon typing will be briefly reviewed, at best, before clicking apply. The average candidate on Indeed spends 7-8 seconds looking at job posts. That's just the average, so imagine all the people who are on the bottom half of that number looking for just a few seconds. Don't get frustrated by this - lean in. Make your job description just have the most important pieces of information I might want to look at before I apply - I can find out about the extra stuff if I actually get an interview. Make your job description a short bulleted list of experience or requirements you want out of me so I can easily see if I'm qualified or not. You don't need to sell me on everything about this position and this company in the job description and if you try it'll be too long for me to read. Just keep it short, and simple. 2. Most of your traffic is from candidates applying on their phones - keep it short Really can't reiterate this enough - not only would I not read a 5+ paragraph job description, I wouldn't be able to. 60% of your applicants are viewing your jobs on their phones, so if you don't have a mobile friendly job description you're encouraging people to either not apply or not bother reading your post. 3. Sell job seekers on your company through branding, not in your job description It's good to have a few quick sentences at the top about the company, but make it 1-3 sentences. I'm going to search for info on the company through Indeed's company page reviews, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, etc. You don't need to sell me on the company on the job description, and you need to trim as much of the non-essential text from your job posts as possible. Leave it to your company branding on these recruitment sites to sell me on the company. (Note: if you don't have reviews and content on all 3 of those sites that I can find, I'm much less inclined to take a job from you) 4. Don't try to stand out Coming up with creative job titles like \"Sales Rockstar Wanted!!\" or \"Full-Stack Software Ninja Needed\" seem like an easy way to show your personality as a company and stand out in the search results, but it's counterintuitive. Indeed works off of keywords just like Google, so whatever a job seeker types in, that's what type of jobs show up. Having the right keywords not only in your job description, but in the title, is one of the most important keys to success on Indeed. So while you think these fun job titles will help you stand out in the search results, what it's actually doing is making your job posts show up lower in the search results by being less relevant. Most candidates just type in the title of the job they want, so just make the title of the job post the actual title of the job.

Many establishments rely on their hourly workers to manage day-to-day operations, helping ensure that everything runs smoothly. Hourly workers like the ones at Walmart are also often on the front line interacting with customers, making them the faces of the business. This is why it is critical to hire, and maintain,¬† a quality hourly workforce - but this is no easy feat. The Hiring Challenge Looking for quality hires in the hourly workforce has gotten tougher over the years. Despite having thousands of active job seekers in the market on a daily basis, businesses still struggle to identify the quality hires that would make the cut for the job they are advertising for. Hiring managers may get overwhelmed by the amount of resumes and applications that pile on them all at once. They often face the challenge of sorting and organizing these to identify the right applicants, a task which can be very time-consuming. The Foundation to Reduce Turnover Hiring people that stay is key for any business. A Cornell study found that the average cost of losing one hourly employee is $5,864. This high cost of turnover accounts for the loss of productivity, cost of rehiring, and training these new employees. This may also include additional costs such as overtime pay for other employees who are covering the extra shifts of the employee that left. To reduce turnover rates, businesses should focus on the first step of hiring - getting the right people. Go Digital and Mobile Job postings in newspapers are a thing of the past. It was found that 60% of job seekers today look for work through online job boards and 50% of them by word of mouth. Being where your prospective candidates are is the first step to increasing your company‚Äôs visibility. Evaluate your target demographic and make sure that you are posting the jobs on online boards where these people are spending time. For example, LinkedIn works best for hiring managerial level employees. Hourly workers, on the other hand, are mostly on social media channels and job boards like Facebook, Instagram , Indeed, and Craigslist . Today, over half of the people looking for a new job are searching on a mobile device. This simply means that your online job postings should be mobile-optimized for easy viewership. Improve Job Descriptions Full transparency about the job and benefits will help in filtering out candidates who may not be a good fit for the role. Writing a good job description can help you differentiate yourself from your competitors greatly. Read the full guide to writing an effective job description to attract quality hires . Go Beyond Qualifications The first criteria in the hiring process is typically the candidate's qualifications and experience. Go beyond this and look for those who display passion in the things they do and even for your business as well. People who love what they do tend to stay in a job longer than those who are there just to pass the time or merely for the sake of earning a few bucks. Data Data plays a huge part in hiring too . One of the most useful strategies in hiring is seeing where¬† the majority of your applicants are coming from so that you can focus on reaching out to quality hires through these channels. Businesses can consider running sponsored posts on targeted platforms rather than going through a trial and error format and wasting resources on sponsoring job ads in the wrong channels. At Workstream , we understand the challenges that you face when hiring hourly workers. We provide tools that can make your process faster and more cost efficient .

Company culture refers to the shared ethos of an organization. In other words, it defines how employees act based on the shared values, goals, attitudes, and practices of the company. And you can guess why this is so important to employees. Think about it - would you rather work for a company whose values you personally believe in or one that possesses values that are not aligned with your own. Definitely the former, right? As we move into a world that co-exists with COVID-19, how important is company culture when it comes to staffing your restaurant? When the pandemic hit the world in early 2020, the country was placed in lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. Restaurants and the like had to close down their stores temporarily (or permanently) as there was no business for them in such a climate. Now that the situation has improved and the economy seems to be picking up, these same restaurant owners are faced with a new problem - staffing their restaurant. According to a Census poll in April, it was found that 40% of restaurant companies were having difficulty finding staff as compared to just 5% of finance and insurance businesses, which had the option of working remotely. Evidently, this staffing problem probably arose due to the limitations that come with working in a restaurant. So how can restaurant managers overcome this crisis? Culture, as we know it, is undoubtedly crucial when it comes to hiring. In this article, we discuss some of the hiring challenges faced by restaurants in today‚Äôs situation and how important company culture is in improving their staffing crisis. Hiring Challenges Fears of COVID-19 In an industry where positions are mostly high-contact, many are not ready to go back to work. And this is the case for the restaurant industry where one will be interacting with hundreds of customers and third-party vendors just in a day. Due to these feelings of uncertainty, hiring managers are not able to find workers who are willing to work the shift for their restaurant. And this is understandably so. Individuals fear contracting COVID-19 or spreading the virus to their loved ones when they get back home. Even if it is to work in the back of house, there is a higher possibility of coming into contact with a positively tested COVID-19 individual as compared to just staying at home. After all, the virus is highly contagious, to say the least. Family Responsibilities Needless to say, the inability to work remotely in the industry has considerable impacts on the decision of individuals to work in a restaurant. Those with family responsibilities may have unresolved elderly or childcare issues that hinder them from leaving their house to work. Even if they want to work for the restaurant, it is unfortunately not within their capabilities to do so. Unemployment Benefits After President Biden introduced the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan , many believed that this impacted the recruiting space for the restaurant industry negatively. The plan, which provides a $300 weekly aid for the unemployed up till September 6, may arguably pay more than actually working itself and may be the reason why employees choose not to go back to work. This is especially so in the restaurant industry where wages are still perceived as low. About 76% of workers surveyed by One Fair Wage said that they are leaving the industry due to low wages and tips . Amidst the pandemic, the unemployment benefits provided by the government will likely discourage individuals from taking up jobs in the restaurant industry. After all, why slog through shifts when the benefits give you more time to search for a better job? The problems listed above are not exhaustive but they are the more common challenges hiring managers face in the current climate. While some are persisting problems that existed even before COVID-19 existed, the pandemic has surely brought about another wave of issues to the hiring crisis. Some companies have already recognized these problems and are making changes in the way they hire and what they have to offer, all to attract more talent to their organization. At the end of the day, your company culture is the determinant that will set these changes in motion. Read on to find out why culture is an essential part of hiring and how you can cultivate an inviting culture in your company. Why is Company Culture Important? Job Satisfaction Naturally, those who are able to identify with their company are happier and tend to be more satisfied with their job. As such, they will show more loyalty to their company and are more likely to stay on the job for a longer period. With greater loyalty, employees are also more committed to their work as they feel that they are a part of a bigger cause. More importantly, as employees feel satisfied, turnover rates are kept at the minimum, which will ultimately reduce your company‚Äôs hiring costs. Talent Attraction Aside from reaping the benefits your employees‚Äô job satisfaction can bring, you are also building a reputation for your organization when you establish a particular culture within your company. The culture your company upholds determines the course of action it will take in times of crisis. For example, what did your organization do during the COVID-19 pandemic? Did they take appropriate measures to ensure that their employees are well protected? Your company culture is defined by the actions taken by the management team. It is not merely about the values you claim you uphold anymore. Needless to say, a company that puts its employees first will have a good reputation among candidates. In the current pandemic climate today, such qualities of a company are especially prioritized by many job seekers. They want to know that their company will have their backs when the going gets tough. Of course, this makes the job more attractive, making hiring less of a headache for your recruitment team. Cultivating a Good Culture We now know the importance of company culture when it comes to hiring for your restaurant. The question is - how do you cultivate a culture that‚Äôs good enough to improve your hiring capabilities? In light of the pandemic, here are some ways you can consider to make sure that your company is on the right track: 1. Setting the Right Standards Though the hiring pool may be much smaller now, this does not mean that you should settle for just anyone willing to work for your company. Ensure that your candidates are a good fit by asking them cultural fit questions during their interview. Hiring an employee who is a misfit may actually cost you more in the long run as you are unlikely to retain them for a long time, leading to extra costs incurred to hire a replacement. 2. Providing Enough Perks In the restaurant industry, free meals and employee discounts are so commonplace that they can no longer be considered as perks but a basic requirement. While the COVID-19 virus is still within our midst, healthcare benefits are probably something that your prospective employees will appreciate. Aside from that, there are also other things you can invest in to show that your company culture is all about appreciation for its employees. Chick-fil-A , for example, provides a plethora of benefits for their employees to increase retention and employee engagement. Some of these include health insurance and performance-based bonuses. They also make it a point to help their employees grow professionally by providing career planning and leadership programs, and give credit when it‚Äôs due by implementing recognition schemes to identify exceptional team members. 3. Implementing Practices that Align with Your Values As aforementioned, company values are guidelines that shape the culture in your organization. However, merely stating these rules of conduct on your website does not mean that your team embodies them. The strategies you implement during moments of adversity will clearly demonstrate the values your company upholds. One of the most important values you want to instill in your organization is empathy . As we transition into a post-COVID world, empathy must extend to your employees and not just your customers. According to Business Solver, 92% of employees stated that having empathetic leaders will make them more likely to stay with their jobs . In other words, having an upper management team that understands them better and translating it to an implementation that provides them a better work environment is likely to increase employee retention. So, how do you do this? Consider implementing a two-way communication platform between the employees and management teams so that ideas can bounce off both parties. Alternatively, you can establish an anonymous feedback channel to receive unfiltered views from employees about the company. By doing this, you are letting your employees know that you are making it a point to understand their position a little better. In this pandemic, having empathy entrenched in your company‚Äôs culture will improve your hiring capabilities. By addressing the concerns of the working population such as job security and protective measures during these troubling times, individuals will be more encouraged to apply for jobs at your restaurant. Summing Up The pandemic has given rise to many problems in the restaurant industry. Initially having to lay off people due to the slow business, managers are now struggling to find workers to equip their restaurant as the economy picks up. Though the current situation might seem bleak for the industry, cultivating a good culture within the organization can help solve your hiring problem. Ensure that you are not shortchanging your current and future workers and make the effort to understand their problems. Most importantly, live up to the values your company upholds. After all, actions speak louder than words so, walk the talk. Want to stay updated with the trends in the restaurant industry? Subscribe to our blog today!

Is it Safe?\" Actually, it's no secret that restaurants are hurting due to the strict restrictions still in place in most states. You don't get people literally carrying a coffin to the New York governor's office if the situation wasn't dire. Even 'Salt Bae' can't catch a break. That's why so many in the industry have their eyes on Florida where coronavirus restrictions were recently lifted for bars and restaurants. Despite some residents' trepidation, many locations were filled to capacity with patrons thankful to be able to get a bite or a drink from their favorite eateries. With about a 2-week incubation period for the virus, the clock has started on whether Florida will see a spike in cases or not. Other cities are lifting restrictions as well, just not as full steam ahead. Both Massachusetts and New York are allowing more indoor capacity, the latter finally allowing up to 25% seating inside . While this will help restaurants do more business, most owners say they need at least 50% capacity indoors to stay afloat. And even if the state allows for more bodies, the vast majority of New Yorkers won't feel comfortable heading inside to dine quite yet according to a poll on Eater New York . Moment of Truth It seems many restaurants are at their breaking point and this is the moment of truth for much of the industry: can locations reopen for indoor dining or not ? While there is still some hope for a new stimulus package ( with $120 earmarked for restaurants included ), it may come too late for stores that need revenue ASAP. And at this point, many restauranteurs are tired of waiting for the government to take action and would rather take their futures into their own hands. It's a tough time for the industry, though there are still growth areas such as QSRs . But it seems like we'll know what winter will look like for business in the coming few weeks. In Other News... Office Space is Virtually Free A recent Gallup poll showed that US workers have doubled their remote workdays each month due to the ongoing pandemic, and there doesn't seem to be many signs that those numbers will decrease anytime soon, even if there is a working vaccine. In short, Americans have gotten a taste of the ten-second commute and quite enjoy it, and employers are warming up to the idea as well. One advantage that companies love? The lower overhead that comes with a virtual office. In fact, a new report by commercial real estate experts Cushman & Wakefield showed that global office vacancies will continue to rise through 2022, and it will take until 2025 for the market to recover. That may even be optimistic since many companies that can hire at the moment are expanding their employee count by adding more remote workers. Facebook, Google, and Amazon are all adding to their staff with most working from home. It remains to be seen if they ever return to the traditional office environment. But remote expansion isn't just for the big guys; more SMBs are \"expanding\" their office with remote hires, enjoying this new era of low-overhead. When office space is virtually free, why not add, say, a few more sales people working remotely? A More Efficient Workforce, in Many ways Even pre-pandemic, research about working-from-home showed that it benefitted both the employee and the employer in various ways. Remote workers saved money on commuting, led healthier lives, and had less stress. Meanwhile, employers found that their employees worked 1.4 more days every month, on average, and also worked more minutes each workday. Of course, an effective remote work setup takes some investment from each company to do it right. In fact, the pandemic triggered the greatest business technology spending rush in history , to the tune of $15 billion each week as employees shifted to remote work . But these are mostly one-time investments (laptops, conferencing software, etc.) while the savings on commuting, rent, office supplies, and more will continue to drastically reduce overhead. It's no wonder more SMBs are expanding to a size they never thought they could now that they don't have four walls as constraints. Hiring for the Long Remote Haul The companies looking to expand remotely have to hire with this in mind, selecting candidates who are self-motivated, flexible, and understands the technological requirements to work effectively outside of the traditional office. They also need to shore up their contactless hiring & onboarding capabilities by leveraging better technology. Finally, now that companies have the opportunity to hire a candidate regardless of geographical location, this exponentially opens up the pool of employees to choose from. Hiring managers will need a good methodology to approach this new type of national hiring. Workstream can help with that.

It is important that you give your new employees a warm welcome on their first day at work and formally introduce them to your organization‚Äôs culture, mission, vision, and values. Here are some best practices to achieve an effective employee orientation: Pre-Orientation Greet employees at reception with a smile üòä New Hire Paperwork. Help your new employee to review and sign all the HR administrative paperwork. These forms include:¬† W-4 , W-9, Direct Deposit Form, Direct Deposit Form, and Form 8850. If you're unsure what each form is for, you can learn more here . You can also ensure employees fill out this paperwork by uploading them to Workstream - the employees will receive text reminders until they sign the paperwork via their text link. Introduce your new employees to co-workers. This is incredibly important to ensure employees will work well together. Use an icebreaker game if you're onboarding multiple people the week - for example you can have each person share a fun fact about themselves. Accompany employees to their work stations. Make sure they feel comfortable and check that all equipment is in it proper working condition. Quick Department Tour. Show your new employees around the common areas such as the lunchroom, bathrooms, employee parking, etc. Orientation Business fundamentals. Introduce the company mission, vision, values and leadership. Inspire, motivate and make your new employees feel welcome. Employee handbook . Typically encloses all the company's rules and regulations, company culture etc. Explain and review of key policies of your company. Even if this is covered in the handbook, you should review these policies, such as those for safety, security, health, and more. Don't assume people will read the handbook in detail. Define job responsibilities. What is their core function? How is their work being reviewed? Set expectations from day 1 and give them an opportunity to ask questions. Physical tour of the workplace. Guide them through nearby workstations and facilities, so they know where they are allowed to go and what areas to avoid. Introduction to benefits and perks. Employees love to hear about this - share some of the perks about working at your company. Do you have bonuses if they hit milestones, such as for their first year? Also, what are their options for medical insurance, paid sick leave, annual leave? Explain when they can expect a raise - how many months or years into their work. Training and mentoring. Schedule a training session with your new employee to teach them the ropes. Pair a senior employee with a new employee to develop a mentor-mentee relationship. Mentorship is a great way to reduce churn. Get Feedback. Ask your employees to ask questions once they've completed the process. And ask them again a few days later - remember that orientation is a bit overwhelming and they need time to process all this new information!

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 04/14/20 Tips on Helping Out Hourly Workers During Coronavirus Crisis Share this article The coronavirus pandemic has triggered a massive financial downturn, impacting businesses and industries all over the world. In the US alone, roughly 6 million workers have lost their main sources of income, leading to almost 10 million people filing for unemployment claims in the latter half of March 2020. Experts claim that this is the largest setback experienced since the Great Depression, and that the situation is highly unlikely to improve over the next few weeks. Given the current financial crisis, hourly workers find themselves in a precarious situation. Despite the fact that hourly workers take care of the day-to-day operations of most companies, not only are they not given health insurance or benefits, they are also typically among the first to get their working hours reduced or be let go entirely. On the other end of the spectrum, those who are fortunate enough to still have work are often found at the frontlines of businesses, such as in grocery stores, gas stations, and even healthcare facilities - increasing their risk of being infected. Based on an internal report by Workstream on how the coronavirus has affected healthcare hourly workers, the current COVID-19 situation has led to longer hours, increased demands, and lower compensation. A survey by Willis Towers Watson revealed that only 65% of their respondents in the healthcare industry would pay hourly workers should they need to stay home if they tested positive. This number falls even lower to 42% when asked if they would pay hourly workers working in healthcare organizations should their workplace experience a closure. In this article, I hope to share strategies, ideas, and tactics on how each one of us can support hourly workers, to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on them as well as their families. This list is not meant to be exhaustive but as a jumpstart to supporting our essential employees. Here are some of the tips I have implemented in my daily life to help out: 1) Share new job postings on social media and tag your friends who may need a new job. Let them know about work opportunities from Amazon, Kroger, DeliverThat, or local businesses that may still be open. 2) Donate to or create a funding campaign to help hourly workers. You can start with a $100-campaign to help a family get a week's groceries. 3) Order a week's worth of grocery online via Instacart or Amazon for your friend or favorite hourly worker. 4) Buy products or gift cards from local businesses that are still operational, so that they can keep their business afloat. 5) Tip very generously when you order food from Instacart, DoorDash, or UberEats. Or any delivery services in your area. 6) Write an online review on Yelp, Google Reviews, or Facebook, taking care to mention the hourly worker who delivered your food or prepared your takeout order, and thank him or her for the great service. 7) Donate to local food banks that are helping out hourly workers. 8) The next time you buy groceries from your local Safeway or Trader Joe's, show your appreciation to the staff by saying a big \"Thank you!!\" 9) Start a virtual tip jar for hourly workers in your neighborhood and encourage people in your network to donate. 10) Consider creating an extra job by hiring a virtual assistant or outsourcing some of your work online. 11) Contact friends who are hourly workers or your favorite local hourly worker who works close to your home - check in on how they are doing and show them that you care. 12) Encourage employees to share sick leave with fellow employees. 13) Share a Tweet, Facebook or LinkedIn story about your favorite interaction with an hourly worker 14) Spread the word on how each of you can help other hourly workers in your personal networks We interact, meet with, and depend on many hourly workers every day. They work in multiple local businesses that we know of - from your favorite supermarket and cafe, to the gas station you drive to every week. They are the hardest hit in this current crisis, and we should be doing our best to give back to them and their families in our little way.

But as a restaurant owner, you surely had high hopes for what business could be like as things began moving toward a more stable version of the ‚Äúnew normal.‚Äù Yet, it seems, for the time being, at least some of your plans may need to be put on hold because the pandemic isn‚Äôt quite over yet. And restaurant-goers still aren‚Äôt as comfortable as they used to be. According to a National Restaurant Association survey of 1,000 adults this past August, 6 in 10 adults reported changing how they go to restaurants due to the rise of the Delta variant. So, how do you do it? How do you run a restaurant during the covid-19 pandemic? How do you not only survive but thrive in a time where change is the only constant? Well, it‚Äôs quite simple actually. You adapt. You become agile. And you learn how to apply lessons from successful restaurants during Covid. We know you need more info than that though! So, in this post, we‚Äôll be diving into 5 lessons QSR owners across the country have learned and applied during the pandemic. We‚Äôll also be sharing some ideas on how you, too, can set yourself up for success! 5 Lessons from Successful Restaurants During Covid #1 Adopt and Take Advantage of Digital Tools Restaurant-goers have become more tech-savvy than ever. Consequently, they want more ways, not less, to use tech to improve their restaurant experience. According to the National Restaurant Association‚Äôs February 2021 study , consumers reported wanting to see restaurants use more tech to do things like: Make ordering and payment easier (52%) Improve customer service (51%) Offer more convenient takeout and delivery options (49%) Make the overall restaurant experience faster (46%) Provide more food information; e.g. allergens, nutritional data, source (44%) Provide more entertainment options (29%) How can you apply these insights? Well, for starters, aim for agility, not perfection. If you‚Äôre not already, make sure you‚Äôre on third-party apps like UberEats and Grubhub. But don‚Äôt stop there! Instead, aim to embed technologies that streamline processes and elevate the customer experience. #2 Collect and Leverage Customer Data Thanks to your in-house POS software, you likely already have data on your customers. But, considering the changes that have likely occurred to your customer base during the pandemic, we need to ask: is your customer data outdated? It could be. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre out of luck! There are ways to collect new, more relevant data on your current customer base. One way to do this is to source data from your third-party ordering apps. For example, you could find out popular meal combinations, peak ordering times, and other user preferences to create new promotions and discounts. But, again, you can go a step further. How? By implementing a customer loyalty program similar to the one that‚Äôs long been used by Starbucks. Loyalty programs are also a way to collect even more data on your customers that can be used to do things like: Use a customer‚Äôs past purchases to create targeted ads Build a connection with customers by offering personalized gifts (e.g. birthday offers) Create a unique customer experience both online and offline Since the start of the pandemic, QSR restaurants like Wendy‚Äôs, Burger King, White Castle, and McDonald‚Äôs have joined Starbucks in offering attractive loyalty programs. And the data supports their decision! In Paytronix‚Äôs January 2021 ‚ÄúDelivering on Restaurant Rewards‚Äù report , survey results showed that loyalty programs members spent more than 2x as much as the consumers not partaking in loyalty programs. #3 Build and Maintain Your Online Presence Digital marketing was an important strategy for your QSR before Covid started. Now, it‚Äôs not just important. Building and maintaining a strong online presence is essential to staying relevant and at the top of your customers‚Äô minds. What type of things should you focus on? Start by making sure things like your menus, hours of location, and dine-in policies are up-to-date on Google and your social media profiles. Then, get innovative by investing money and effort in your social media marketing strategy. As is the case with any digital marketing strategy, building your social media presence is a long game. But it can have huge payoffs, especially in a time when you‚Äôre less likely to get customers casually passing your restaurant while out and about. Shake Shack can be a great source of inspiration. During the initial days of quarantine, the fast food burger chain started a social cooking series on Instagram and Tik Tok to teach consumers how to make some of the restaurant‚Äôs popular items at home. #4 Hire Smartly and Invest in Your Staff Hiring the right employees has always been a challenge. But, as you probably know, it‚Äôs particularly challenging right now. According to Total Food Service , QSR owners have reported a 66% decrease in applications for front-of-house jobs and an 88% decrease in applications for delivery driver jobs. Consequently, welcoming restaurant patrons back to dine-in has not gone smoothly. In August 2021, two Chick-fil-A stores in Alabama had to close their dining rooms due to a labor shortage. So, don‚Äôt take this challenge lightly! You‚Äôll need to do more than you did before the pandemic to hire and retain quality staff. When it comes to hiring, one of the best things you can do is to invest in a digital hiring platform that makes it easy for job seekers to apply, convenient for you to review applications, and simple to follow up with quality candidates. For example, by investing in Workstream‚Äôs applicant tracking system, Burger King managed to overcome a staffing problem due to low application flow and an inefficient hiring process. To retain employees, we recommend not only financial incentives but also educational ones. Shake Shack has allocated more than $10 million to invest in restaurant-level employees . One of their initiatives is a career development program for entry-level managers who want to improve their professional and business skills. #5 Consider Opening Ghost Kitchens Even before the rise of the delta variant, customers were hesitant to return to restaurants for dine-in. Consequently, food delivery has been and will continue to be a popular option for many. And with that shift from dine-in to delivery, an opportunity for innovation arrived in the form of ghost kitchens. If you‚Äôve never heard of ghost kitchens, let us fill you in real quick. A ghost kitchen is a kitchen for food prep that isn‚Äôt attached to a brick-and-mortar location. The major benefit of a ghost kitchen is that, due to its minimal setup, the costs to run them are relatively low. Sometimes, as Vice News reports in the video below, there are even multiple restaurant franchises operating out of the same ghost kitchen: QSR restaurants like Wendy‚Äôs took advantage of this new restaurant model during the pandemic to accelerate their global expansion. Wendy's opened ghost kitchens around the world in locations, such as the Philippines and UK, to reach markets that their traditional brick-and-mortar restaurants could not. Wendy‚Äôs has even made it clear that they believe the increased demand for delivery is here to stay well beyond the pandemic. The fast food chain recently announced that they plan to open 700 more ghost kitchens across the world by 2025 with the hope that each unit will earn up to $1 million a year in sales. How can you take advantage? Well, if you own multiple franchise locations that are struggling, you might consider renovating one of them into a ghost kitchen. If so, you can use the space to just service takeout and delivery orders. Then, you may even be able to collaborate and share the costs with other restaurants in the same position. Key Takeaways What lies ahead for the future of the restaurant industry after Covid? Only time will tell. But, as we‚Äôve shown in this post, there are things you can do to successfully adapt and maybe even thrive despite the current conditions! We recommend you follow the lessons of other successful restaurants by taking steps to: Adopt and take advantage of digital tools Collect and leverage customer data Build and maintain your online presence Hire smartly and invest in your staff Consider opening ghost kitchens TAGS People management Articles Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

You‚Äôve committed to working potentially 90+ hours a week, running a team of hourly workers, and establishing a new place that serves a local community that you want to give back to. Congratulations, you‚Äôre now running a Quick-Service Restaurant (QSR) franchise business. Or maybe, not quite yet. Let‚Äôs wait to uncork that champagne in case you‚Äôre just in the planning stages. Maybe you‚Äôve heard from other franchisees how wonderful it is to be your own boss, yet have the help and support of a large corporation being the wind in your sails. Maybe you‚Äôve seen various franchises around your area, Domino‚Äôs, Chick-fil-A, McDonald‚Äôs, Subway, or Carl‚Äôs Jr., outlast other small businesses, and even expand into new, nearby locations. In 2019, there were close to 800,000 franchise establishments and operators in America , which had been on an upward trend for years, so you‚Äôre not wrong: franchises are thriving. But what does it take to succeed as a QSR franchisee and entrepreneur? Is opening a franchise as turn-key as you think it is? What exactly goes into running a franchise location, not just to barely survive but to thrive and be profitable? Over the years, I have sat down with dozens of QSR franchise owners and have learned the tips and tricks from some of the best operators in the country. I‚Äôve spoken with franchisees who own hundreds of QSR locations, as well as those who own just two or three highly profitable stores. I‚Äôve put together this ultimate guide to be a one-stop-shop to understanding what it takes to succeed in QSR franchising, summing up years of research and conversations with the top QSR franchisees in America. The aim of this guide is to help those who are serious about embarking on their own QSR franchise journey crystalize what they will have to do, and the considerations that they will have to make, to become a success in this industry. Negotiate a great lease for your location Finding a great location for a QSR is key to success, and so is negotiating the lease so it works in your favor. Signing a badly negotiated lease can make it nearly impossible to keep your business afloat. Let‚Äôs discuss some strategies to put your new business in an advantageous position. Location, location, location One of the most important pillars of a successful QSR comes long before spending a single dollar: where your restaurant will go. As you carefully select the location of your QSR, there are a few factors to keep in mind. Does the location you have in mind have great foot traffic? Don‚Äôt guess on this important factor. You should physically survey the spot and measure just how much foot traffic the area gets. How about on weekdays? Or weekends? What time of day does foot traffic peak? Ask surrounding businesses what their experience has been over the last year or two. Have they seen foot traffic increase or decrease during this time? Does this location serve people looking for a quick lunch during office rush hours, or families out with their children? Depending on your specific franchise brand, you‚Äôll want to target more of one group than another. Are you looking to serve as a grab-and-go hub, or more of a sit-down location? Understanding the type of people in your chosen area can help you either formulate a plan of attack, or quickly make you decide to choose another location. Does your location do seasonal business? QSRs near schools understand that there is a huge difference in traffic between the fall and summer seasons. Or if you are in a part of the country where winters are cold, how will your smoothie shack perform when it‚Äôs below freezing? Can the summer traffic cover your costs during leaner winter months? Does this location have easy access to public transportation? What is the parking situation like? What will the drive-thru situation look like if there is a long line of cars? The easier the area is to get to, the better the business will do. Research whether there are any plans to bring a train or bus stop to the area. This is often a good sign of a good investment for future growth. Find a great real estate agent Sometimes, the franchise corporate team can help connect you with a real estate agent that can help you make the right decisions. Otherwise, asking for referrals from other QSR operators in your area or within your brand can be a good source for finding a trustworthy agent. Get the right leasing terms for you There are many factors that contribute to signing a commercial lease. How many years are you planning to sign for? Are you signing a lease during a recession or when the economy is booming? Is the area you want a brand new shopping mall or at a property that has been around for decades? Generally, if you are confident in your chosen location, it makes sense to sign for a longer period of time as it will often help you get better pricing. Likewise, signing during a recession can help you get better deals. Raise capital and funding Now that you‚Äôve chosen the location for your QSR, it‚Äôs time to gather the funds to establish your business. Raising capital is a constant area of concern for prospective entrepreneurs and I hear from franchisees that there is a surprising lack of information on this topic online. So let‚Äôs dive into the top places to secure funding to finance your QSR. Your personal network Often, the entrepreneur‚Äôs own savings is the main source of seed money to start their QSR business. This obviously comes with a huge risk of potentially losing your savings in a bad business venture. So how can one mitigate the cost and risk a bit more? Loop in your personal network into your business. Be it friends or family, raising a small round of capital from people you personally know is a solid way to start gathering funds. If it was good enough for Jeff Bezos who got his parents to chip in to his strange ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù idea , it might work for you too. Maybe don‚Äôt promise that you‚Äôll be the next Amazon, but rather that you have a great plan in place to run a successful QSR location. No matter who invests from your personal network, write down an agreement defining the terms and details of their investment and what repayment will look like. Your friends and family may trust you inherently, but it‚Äôs necessary to get everything in writing so everyone has a reference to the terms. Angel investors If you can pitch your business proposal to private investors, often referred to as angel investors, you might be able to raise your initial seed money very quickly. A popular approach especially in Silicon Valley, is to connect with angel investors via platforms such as Angelist, Republic, and you can also connect with them on LinkedIn, local networking groups, and at conferences. I have personally raised capital from angel investors several times, and I find that the best way to do so is to build long-term relationships with mentors and advisors that you trust. These relationships may be for many months or several years, because at the end of they day, they are investing into you more than they are the business. Earning their trust is everything. Institutional funds/Private equity funds A popular financial option for franchisees are institutional funds focused on the QSR industry: The Kitchen Fund, Joe Montana‚Äôs Liquid 2 Ventures, FransMart, Rock Capital, FOCUS Group, Apollo Group, and more. Typically, these private equity funds tend to invest at a point when there is already some traction. For example, they're interested when you have been able to prove your growth to at least 2-5 locations in your business. They want to know that you have experience and a proven track record before they invest in you. Crowdfunding These days, many entrepreneurs have used platforms like Indiegogo and Kickstarter to raise capital for their business venture. They can even go viral on social media to spur interest from the community. Of course, it helps if you have a great story behind why you want to launch a business in a particular location. If a large part of your QSR goal is to contribute to a specific town or area, this can be a great opportunity to tell your unique story and gain interest from locals who want to invest into their own neighborhood. Craft a video telling your vision and story and publish it to your online networks. Even small contributions can quickly add up as your crowdfunding page is shared. Build a great team and culture Building a great team and culture is the number one priority for any QSR franchise operator. From preparing the food, to maintaining the location, to customer interactions, and everything else in between; your team is the lifeblood of your business. The average franchise location can have anywhere from 10 employees (think Subway, for example) to over 80 (think Chick-fil-A). No matter the number, it‚Äôs not a simple matter managing a team, and it‚Äôs even harder when they may be far away in multiple locations across town. This is why it‚Äôs so important to hire great people, train them up well, and treat them with respect. Building a great team and establishing a solid culture starts from the top. Clearly lay out the culture & values of your business It is crucial for a QSR operator to lay out the culture and values for your business, or even for your location. From conversations with the top QSR operators, I have learned that they clearly define the values that motivate them internally, beyond a pure bottom line point of view. They want to empower the community, give back to people, and become a driving force in providing high-quality food to their customers in an efficient way. It is important for a QSR operator to actually write down the culture and values and to share it often with your employees. Make it shareable and easily accessible, and include it as part of the onboarding process for new hires. Here is a sample of Workstream‚Äôs company values: Humble and hungry: Be scrappy. Focus on getting things done. We measure by things done and less by facetime. Stay humble, stay hungry. Everyone does customer success: We are obsessed with customer success. We work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust and make them succeed in their work. Don‚Äôt lose the human touch: We are solving an important problem and believe in teamwork and putting people first. We focus on helping others, and are fanatical about keeping the human connection. We are the people. Direct feedback is a gift: Feedback helps us to improve and move forward. We believe in honesty, transparency, and helping each other to improve and become better. As Brian Chesky, co-founder and CEO of AirBnb famously said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fuck up the culture. Culture is simply a shared way of doing something with passion. Our culture is the foundation for our company.‚Äù Hire the best talent The average employee churn at QSR locations can be up to 150% annually . Many operators have to hire a new person every week for a single location. At this turnover rate, you may think it would be easier to hire whoever you can, no matter their skill or aptitude. Some QSR owners have even propagated the idea that who you hire doesn‚Äôt really matter. This couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. It‚Äôs crucial to hire great talent, not only to mitigate churn, but to grow the business as well. Great hourly workers become great managers, and that‚Äôs the path to expanding or even running another franchise location. Invest in the right resources to hire well , provide proper training, and reap the benefits of good workers who help you accomplish more than you ever thought you could. Create an environment of teamwork and open feedback Running a quick-service restaurant is a team sport. It‚Äôs not possible for a single employee or operator to run a Chick-fil-A or Pieology location, and it is crucial for you as the franchise owner to understand it yourself (too many owners try to do it all on their own). You need to foster a s trong team culture of placing the team before yourself and working towards a common shared goal: running a successful QSR franchise. I am a huge fan of Netflix‚Äôs Culture Deck , which outlines their philosophy and methods to creating a strong culture for your team. One of the key points that leads to great teamwork is feedback on actions. Not all feedback is created equal. You can overly sugarcoat feedback, making it too subtle for any point to be made. At the same time, you don‚Äôt want to make it a personal attack. That always causes employees to become defensive and resistant. Therefore, the feedback should always be about the action, not the person. A great treatise on creating a teamwork-based culture is one by Bill Walsh, the former coach of San Francisco 49ers, called ‚ÄúThe Score Takes Care of Itself‚Äù. Bill took a group of players who were struggling to solidify into an actual team and transformed them in a couple of seasons from being last in the league to champions. Coaches used to rely on screaming and shouting, and Bill created Standards of Performance (SOPs) for everything from answering the phone to training top players. The SOPs were lists of how to do certain things so everyone on Bill‚Äôs team was consistent. They include: Be positive. Spend more time telling people what to do rather than what not to do. Don‚Äôt address negative issues just to vent Be prepared Be detail oriented but don‚Äôt bury yourself in details Be accountable Be near sighted and far sighted Be fare. Ethically sound values are important. Be clear about what you stand for, then stand up for it Don‚Äôt budge from your values, standards, principals Consistency is important but you must also be quick to adapt to changing circumstances Believe in yourself Be a leader Being a former professional basketball athlete myself, I could relate to and identify many of the similar values and pointers of how running a quick-service restaurant is similar to building and leading a sports team. Align closely with your franchise corporate partners Each QSR brand, from Jamba Juice to Burger King, has their own unique initiatives and corporate structure. As a QSR operator, you‚Äôll need to work closely with corporate HQ to align with their vision and brand direction. While some may consider this to be stifling, most understand that working with the franchise team is the best way to be trained and onboarded property, setting yourself up for the best chance of success. Understand the roles of each corporate partner and team lead In most QSR corporate teams, there will be a mix of key players that you will be in contact with as you start your business. Understanding who these leads are and what they do, and can do for you, will help you navigate your first few steps. VP of Franchise Development: This lead works with new franchise owners to educate them on brand matters. They can work with prospective franchise owners to see if the brand is a right fit for them. VP of Marketing: This lead works closely with QSR owners to help them market not just the franchise brand, but to market their specific new location in the community. VP of Human Resources: This lead works with QSR owners in the sourcing, hiring, and onboarding of employees for each location. They can also help new owners understand what their responsibilities are in managing a team, from payroll to benefits. Be trained and onboarded as a franchisee Typically, during your first three months after signing on as a franchisee, you will be asked to spend one to three weeks at one of the franchise‚Äôs corporate locations to train with these team leads. While there will be literature to read and observations to make, the best training will be actual work on the floor of locations in operation. Be prepared to get your hands dirty as you cook food, serve customers, and really get to know how the business works on a daily basis. It‚Äôs crucial to use this time to ask as many questions as you can about the process of running your own store, as you‚Äôll not only have access to the team leads, but the owners of successful locations. Establishing good relationships at this stage can help you build allies for the future, so be attentive and as friendly as you can! Keep open communications with corporate Nothing stays the same forever, even brands that have been around for decades. As the franchise evolves, the corporate team will provide updates to vision and procedure via emails, quarterly calls, and meet-ups. You‚Äôll also have access to internal resources and guides that are updated regularly as well. Read as much as you can. Pay attention to updates and highlights. They want your franchise to succeed and gleaning tips from other successful locations, adopting the newest menu items quickly, or utilizing corporate‚Äôs new assistance initiatives (ie. marketing blitzes) can help your store perform better. Corporate also appreciates your feedback and honest communication, so don‚Äôt hesitate to ask questions or for assistance. Build a great hiring and onboarding process at your location Putting together a talented, well-trained team is one of the most important things you can do as a franchisee to set yourself up for success. Every hourly worker is a touch point between your business and your customer, which will define the experience your guests have when they come into your location. Poor employees mean poor customer experiences, and your business will be over before it really even starts. So put in the time and effort to source the right talent and train them up properly. Going further, you‚Äôll want to establish an efficient process for hiring that will provide you with the talent pipeline you‚Äôll need as you scale. Remember, hiring for QSR is a never-ending task. With turnover rates as high as 150% each year, your process can‚Äôt be ad hoc; rather, the successful franchisee will develop a strategy to keep that hiring pipeline full and flowing. Have an efficient way to source the best talent. We are in modern times with modern solutions for many hiring bottlenecks. Especially in the QSR industry, speed wins . Take too long to hire for your positions, and your candidates will go elsewhere. Leverage the wide range of resources you have at your disposal: Utilize text-to-apply posters in your local area so people in your community can easily apply for open positions. Make your job application mobile-friendly so people can apply directly from their phones. Create referral programs so your current employees can help you source from their pool of contacts. Invest in hiring automation software like Workstream to post to hundreds of job sites at once. Screen and engage with applicants via text messaging, video, and quizzes Depending on your location, applicants may have many options when looking for hourly work. To stay competitive with other local businesses, be speedy with your responses in order to keep the candidate‚Äôs interest. Text messaging has a 95% open rate compared to email, which only has a 25% open rate. You‚Äôre also 3x more likely to get a response using texts than email. Hence, modern hiring leans toward SMS when engaging with candidates, especially if they are younger. Millennials and Gen-Z have largely grown up with smartphones and texting, and are more comfortable engaging on that platform. A modern way to screen candidates faster is to use smart screening questions on the initial application that can help you easily sort by the most qualified candidates. Questions like: Do you have a license? Can you lift 25lb? Do you have restaurant experience? How many years? If your hiring platform can capture the responses from these quizzes, you‚Äôll be able to sift through hundreds of resumes much faster without accidentally skipping a great candidate. Most recently, businesses have been screening candidates by asking them to upload short videos that helps hiring managers gauge their personalities. Carl‚Äôs Jr. asks candidates to record a 30 second video answering ‚ÄúWhy do you want to work for Carl‚Äôs Jr. and this specific position?‚Äù to see how the applicant communicates and how they present their thoughts. It‚Äôs been a great way to pre-screen candidates before the one-on-one interview and makes sure the pipeline is full of great candidates. Onboard your employees correctly Hiring isn‚Äôt enough to ensure the candidate becomes a good employee. Proper training in the first few weeks is crucial in shaping them to be successful at your location. A well-designed onboarding process is key to this process. Great onboarding involves: Online documentation that lays out the fundamentals of the brand and the role, accessible by each employee Engaged training and orientation videos Supervised hands-on training The employee's main take-away should be the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) they'll need to excel. Leverage technology to improve efficiency As a former QSR manager, I used to pride myself on efficiency by using a mix of paper, books, pens, and emails. As a fairly organized person, I was able to run my business decently, but looking back, I realize I should have utilized much more of the technology I had available to me to find real efficiency. Almost a year into running that business, I became much more open to trying out new software and realized much too late how much time and energy I could have been saving. Perhaps I was too cost-conscious at the time, not understanding how much time actually costs busy owners of a QSR. These days, there are a host of affordable tech available for managers that can boost efficiency. Ranging from hiring and onboarding tools, POS solutions, CRM platforms, and more; it‚Äôs worth taking some time to test out and evaluate these options to see what might work best for your business. Here‚Äôs how to go about finding the right technology for your location: Talk to your team to understand their current time-challenges Stay connected to your team as they are the eyes and ears of the business and will usually know what issues are the biggest problems that take up the most time in their day. Either as a team or in 1-on-1 meetings, find out the pain points in their daily, weekly, and monthly tasks. It‚Äôs important to iterate that their job is safe and that you‚Äôre not trying to replace them. Rather, you are a team trying to figure out how to make the work easier and faster for everyone involved. Some QSR owners conduct a team-wide survey every so often, keeping it anonymous, to get feedback on the challenges they face. This way they are more free to communicate candidly about different issues. However you do it, distill the common problems and try to rank them by how much time each of them costs your team. Conduct market research on the best solutions Now that you have a good idea on the main problems to tackle, find the tools that can help. One of the best ways to do this is to utilize your QSR network. There‚Äôs rarely anything new under the sun when it comes to managing a QSR; meaning, your franchisee peers may have already tackled your issue. See what software or technology they use and evaluate their opinions on the pros and cons. If it worked for one location, there‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôll work for yours. Reach out to your corporate contacts and see what tools they may recommend. Franchise groups may have agreements with companies that offer solutions at a bulk discount. Even if they don‚Äôt, having the clout of the brand behind your request can get you discounts on a solution you‚Äôve found or that corporate suggests. On the flip side of what I wrote above, if you‚Äôre having a specific efficiency problem then there‚Äôs a good chance others are having it as well. Check out software review sites for solutions that may solve your team‚Äôs bottleneck to see how others have rated the technology. Usually there is a free trial for a few days or weeks to evaluate the product. Use this time! Thoroughly vet the software during the free trial to see how it may work with your team. Pro tip: if you contact the company, often they will extend the free trial for you to get a better sense of its use cases. Designate a point of contact to test the product It‚Äôs best to designate a lead on your team to test the solution. For example, if you are testing out Workstream, get your hiring manager or COO to thoroughly use the product to make sure that it can work for them. It‚Äôs often hard for you, the CEO, to make time to test all the details of a product. Unless you‚Äôll be using the software directly each day, assign this task to the team member who will be using it the most. If I could do it all over again, I wouldn‚Äôt be as reluctant to use technology to help by restaurant business. Now that I am on the other side of this equation building the right software for busy owners to use, I know that the cost of the software itself almost always pales in comparison to the time savings for you and your team, let alone the increased business due to better efficiency. Upgrade the skillset of your employees The best way to get the best talent on your team is to train your current team. By keeping them engaged and motivated, you can help them learn more in their role and get more out of them. Due to the high turnover rate of the QSR industry, it‚Äôs a convenient myth to think there is no point in training employees any more than you have to since they‚Äôll just leave in a few weeks or months. The reality is that one of the main reasons they leave is they don‚Äôt feel like there is any room for improvement and growth! Most workers want more training. They want to learn new skills. Teaching them won‚Äôt chase them away; it will in fact make them more loyal . In my experience, I‚Äôve even found that training employees well also encourages them to return to be reemployed at your store. I‚Äôve worked with young adults who left for school, but came back every summer and winter break to work because they appreciated the training I was able to provide. So, how can you continue to grow the skillsets of your hourly workers? Enact a structured training strategy the moment they onboard We already touched on the initial training phase that lasts for a few weeks to a month, but training should never end there. After the initial ‚Äúbasic training,‚Äù there should be advanced sessions designed to specifically target skillsets or higher-level positions. Training shift workers to become shift leaders is the most straightforward goal to base strategies around. What does the average shift worker need to learn to be able to become a shift leader? How long will they need? Perhaps there is a 3-month long training process that includes on-the-job training that will get an employee to this goal. A more lateral training opportunity would be to instill new skills such as cooking specific items, operating the drive-thru, dealing with customer service, etc. Target skills that will help them expand their resume. Learning new software and equipment will do that, as well as exposure to more customer-facing roles. Again, have a strategy in place that includes the time allotted to master these new skills. An hourly worker can learn a new skill a month, for example, and quickly expand their usefulness to your location and to their future prospects. Utilize online training tools and resources Coming up with an ongoing training plan may be difficult for new entrepreneurs. Luckily there are online tools and resources that can help you enact these training programs at your QSR location. Massively Open Online Courses (MOOC) are great for self-motivated individuals. Coursera and MITOpenCourseWare are two examples. They have courses and training for skills such as Customer Service, Operations, Marketing, and more. Subscriptions can be a business expense and a worthwhile investment to improve your entire team. Of course, your employees have to feel some sense of self-motivation to do these courses, but you can also incentivize them to learn with bonuses for completing coursework. Great leaders inspire their team in many different ways. And keep in mind that empowering your team and keeping them engaged will only make your business that much better. Happy employees are more productive and can lead to overall growth for your location. Create a partner-system to encourage teamwork and learning Having a ‚Äúbuddy system‚Äù worked well for my own team. I would often pair up a more experienced employee with someone who just started to create a casual mentorship partner system . This always seems to help both sides: the newer employee gets up-to-speed faster, and the seasoned employee learns leadership and accountability skills. Having them work on specific tasks together during the week, often tasks that are new to them, can help this partnership grow. Two heads really are better than one when it comes to training and motivation. Having a partner tackling new challenges with you is something most workers appreciate. Join local franchise groups and communities Being a part of a franchise group means having other owners and operators in the QSR industry to learn from, trade ideas with, and help each other grow. When I was a restaurant owner, I found it invaluable to learn from others who had gone before me. I found that entrepreneurs especially liked to connect with other owners and were willing to help and provide support, because they also had this sort of help as they were coming up. Volunteer to be part of the franchise advisory council Most QSR brands have a franchise advisory council (FAC) that helps owners learn, connect, and grow. They meet once every few months, often in person over a meal, and discuss common challenges franchisees are seeing and how they can overcome them together. Sometimes, you may have to be invited to join an FAC. It‚Äôs worth the wait and persistence because these groups are a great resource. As you make your place in your local QSR community, you will befriend FAC members and find your way in soon enough. Attend franchise conferences and local trade shows Most franchise brands have an annual conference, and some bigger brands may have several regional meetups during the year. These are great opportunities for franchise owners to get together and trade what they have learned. Like the FAC, it‚Äôs a great way to learn from other franchisees in the space. These conferences have lectures on best practices, product showcases, new suppliers, and a host of other things that can help your franchise business grow. Perhaps there‚Äôs a new POS that can cut your management time in half, or a new hiring platform to try out. Most likely, as a franchisee, you‚Äôll get a discount to attend these conferences so do take advantage of them when they come around. Other than brand-specific conferences, there are local and regional trade shows from the National Restaurant Conference, International Franchise Association, and a few others. Read up on what they might have to offer and choose the ones to attend that fit your franchisee the best. Join online franchise communities Franchise groups for your brand probably already exist on Facebook or LinkedIn, but if they don‚Äôt then consider starting one yourself. Online communities are a great way to quickly ask questions to your peers and get feedback readily. It‚Äôs also a great way to keep abreast of the latest news and events affecting your business. Be a mentor to other franchise owners Finally, just because you‚Äôre starting out doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have valuable insights to offer. As a newer owner in the space, perhaps you bring with you new operational methods or technologies that others might benefit from. The more you share your own goals and successes and failures, other franchise owners will do the same and open up to you as well. The QSR space can be a very supportive one with a free exchange of ideas, so take advantage of it with a good mix of give and take. Leverage PR, media, and news to your advantage A successful QSR location is one that people know about and appreciate. As you‚Äôre starting out, it‚Äôs highly beneficial to engage with local media and even some national outlets specific to the space. There are a ton of journalists that cover the industry and you‚Äôve probably read articles about QSR in Franchise Times, QSR Magazine, Entrepreneur.com, and more. But how do you get journalists to pay attention to you specifically? I have been fortunate to be featured on ABC News, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal, TechCrunch, Business Insider, and more. Here are the strategies that have worked for me in getting my message out across various media outlets. Have a strong personal story Behind every entrepreneur is a great story. Jeff Bezos talks about being born to a teenage mother and an immigrant father. Their early family struggles inspired him to empower small businesses. More close to home, a partner of mine, Daljit Hundal, came to America when he was 18. He started as a dishwasher, but worked tirelessly to improve his situation. Today he owns over 50 franchise stores including Pieology, Jamba, and Carl‚Äôs Jr. His determination and pure grit set him apart from the rest in becoming a successful entrepreneur. I‚Äôm always inspired by his story and the story of so many other QSR operators, and these are the stories that can endear you to both the public and the press. What is your personal story? Learning to tell it correctly can give you a leg up when pitching yourself and your business to news outlets looking to tell these stories. Network with local journalists Local journalists always want to cover stories of budding entrepreneurs. Read your local publications both in print and online to see who covers these types of stories (usually in the Business section) and seek them out online via LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, or the work email they list. While you can just pitch your story, it is even better to have written an article about the business aspects of your local community. As a new entrepreneur, you may have an insightful take on what it means to bring a new store to your town. Consider publishing this to your own blog or social platforms and sharing the link with the journalist. If they can see that you have an interesting POV to share, they‚Äôll be more inclined to engage with you to craft a piece for their publication. Don‚Äôt be shy. Journalists welcome news ideas since they‚Äôre on the content treadmill. Reach out with your personal story or how your business impacts the community and see what feedback they give. Write well-crafted emails When you reach out to journalists or online outlets, the best way to get their attention is to write well-crafted emails as your pitch. Start with a good subject line or title to your email that will grab their attention. For example, if you are a local QSR franchise owner in Palo Alto, a good title may be something like ‚ÄúPalo Alto entrepreneur opens new restaurant to serve the community with meals and jobs.‚Äù Especially during this time, that can pique the interest of your target local journalist. In the body of your email, highlight what your intent is and why you are writing in. Are you looking for advice on how to get your story published? Are you trying to get the journalist to directly publish your article? Did you want to chat with the journalist over the phone or via a video meeting? Remember to stay friendly and to always pitch your personal story as well. Leverage the brand of your franchise as that can sway interest. After all, if you‚Äôre opening a new McDonald‚Äôs location, that can be newsworthy in and of itself. HARO: Help a Reporter Out Help a Reporter Out (HARO) is a news marketplace that connects reporters and news stories. There are hundreds of reporters browsing it each day, stating the types of stories they are looking for. You‚Äôll need to sign up, but once you do, it‚Äôs a simple way to find someone who may be looking for your exact story. Give back to the community A QSR‚Äôs purpose isn‚Äôt just to make you money, but also to serve a local community. Great businesses lift the other businesses and individuals around it, and we count on these businesses to contribute to the community for the lifetime of their existence. Codifying the idea of giving back to your community is an important part of running a successful business. Engaging with the neighborhood you serve by helping a nearby school, or providing free catering for local events, is an empowering action for you and your team. After all, we all need a sense of purpose to drive us. Build morale, team culture, and camaraderie QSRs are high stress due to the fast pace and non-stop nature of the business. Having your team do a community project together provides a reason to finally breathe a little and connect in an entirely different way. Taking on a community project is different from the norm, and can dismantle artificial hierarchies that might stiffen team bonding. You as the owner should lead by example, getting ‚Äúdown and dirty‚Äù with your team to do everything together. Working toward an altruistic goal helps develop a team culture quickly. Often, hourly workers get lost in the day-to-day of the job. Unlike management, they might not see how they truly service the community at large. In other cases, you and other higher-level managers may have lost sight of the neighborhood and your hourly workers can help you reconnect with the people you‚Äôre serving. Ideas and projects to help your community: Give out free meals at your location Sponsor a crowdfunding campaign for local projects Volunteer as a team to work on a construction project Run a cooking class for the community Visit a nursing home or hospital with hot meals Start a cooking webinar series for students featuring your team Deliver meals directly to needy families around town I have always been a huge fan of giving back to the community, and I feel it‚Äôs the duty of any growing business to do so. You take care of your community, and they‚Äôll take care of you. Hopefully, it‚Äôs a win-win process for everyone involved, especially since your location may attract some press and more public awareness. But the imperative is beyond that scope and an important moral goal of your new QSR store.
