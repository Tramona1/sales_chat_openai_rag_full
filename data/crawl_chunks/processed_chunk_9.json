    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Recruiting strategies 08/29/19 How Ray Kroc Grew McDonald's into a Global Franchise Share this article When Ray Kroc received an order for 8 of his new trademarked milkshake mixer from a restaurant in California he was impressed that someone saw as much potential in his product as he did. Kroc decided to head out and see who this was . When he arrived, he found out that two McDonald brothers were running a small burger shop. Their menu was very slim, but they focused on delivering high-quality products that nobody else did and that's why their burger shop was so popular. This impressed Kroc and he wanted to improve the efficiency and popularity of the burger shop and this is how McDonald's got started. From a small hamburger restaurant, McDonald's grew into one of the largest and most well-known companies across the whole world. Here is how Ray Kroc was able to achieve this. Always looking for new opportunities A lot of entrepreneurs and businesses fail simply because they are stuck on a certain idea of what their business should be and they never make changes. Sadly, in business, things are far from ideal and you always need to find new opportunities on the market, talk to customers and learn about their wishes, and come up with solutions for them. Kroc has always emphasized the fact that he was able to achieve such great success because he was trying to be at the right place at the right time, and have the courage to do something about the problems customers were having. Are there any potential business opportunities that mean offering different services or products, or can you improve your quality and deliver more value? These are all important things that were always on Kroc's mind. Just think about McDonald's and how many times the company has changed, adjusted, improved, and offered something new that they didn't have before. Kroc never stopped being an entrepreneur, even when things were going well. The business is as good as its employees are Once a business starts growing and more people come on board, the organization no longer depends on the leaders alone to achieve success but on all employees. Simply put, a business is as good as its worst employees are. Your employees are also your company's representatives and they are working and communicating on behalf of your business every day. If they do something wrong your customers won't blame it on them but on your business. The same rule applies when they do something good which makes customers happy. Kroc understood that if he was going to build a big company that would operate throughout the world, he would need good staff that was going to help him because he can't do it alone. He also added a suggestion box where employees could share their thoughts on what can be done to improve the business. This is how some of the most famous meals and drinks were added to McDonald's and they still exist to this day. Employees are a part of your business, so allow them to feel valued and share their thoughts and ideas. Focus on your customers and community It doesn't matter to which community you sell your product or offer services, you need to be a part of it. Ray Kroc has always made a lot of different initiatives that would create communities around all of his restaurants while also trying to improve existing ones. A lot of the operators in McDonald's were hired from the same communities they catered to. For each and every community, he also had local advertisers that would work on certain communities and organize special events, birthdays, holidays, celebrations, and so on. He also thought that his business should give back to the communities through charity work and this is something that the company still does. It's essential to get into the community that you are working with and find ways to make their lives easier, get them to open up to your business, and give them something in return for being loyal customers. This doesn't apply only to food and hospitality businesses, but to all types of organizations. In the end, McDonald's is living proof that you only need to focus on customers and employees to succeed. This is clear even today, as McDonald's continues to learn what customers want and deliver those things while keeping a happy base of employees, even hourly workers.

The purpose of an HRMS is to automate and streamline human resources-related tasks, such as payroll processing, benefits administration, and personnel tracking. In this guide, we provide an in-depth look at HRMSs and discuss the key features that you should look for when choosing a system for your business. What is HRMS? As we mentioned, an HRMS is a software application designed to automate and streamline human resources-related tasks. The core purpose of an HRMS is to help businesses manage employee data more efficiently. By automating HR processes, businesses can save time and money on administrative tasks and focus on more strategic initiatives. There are a number of different types of HRMS on the market, and they vary in terms of features and functionality. Some HRMS are designed for specific industries, while others offer more general-purpose tools. When choosing an HRMS for your business, it’s important to consider your business’ specific needs and requirements. HRIS vs HRMS While many people use the terms HRIS and HRMS interchangeably, there is a difference between the two. An HRIS (human resources information system) is a system that stores employee data. An HRMS, on the other hand, is a system that helps you manage that employee data. In other words, an HRIS is a database of employee information, while an HRMS is a tool that you use to manipulate and act on that data. Most HRMS will include an HRIS component, as employee data is the foundation of any HR system. However, not all HRIS will offer the same level of functionality as an HRMS. When evaluating HRMS, it’s important to consider the features and tools that each system offers. History of HRMS Human resource management systems can be traced back to the 1970s when the first attempts to automate payroll functions were put into practice. These primitive systems would lay the groundwork for the development of more sophisticated HRMS in the years to follow. PeopleSoft introduced one of the first comprehensive HRMS in the 1980s, which included elements like recruiting, attendance, and even benefits administration. By 2000, the practice had finally hit mainstream relevance within corporate structures as direct deposit and employee self-service had become fully adopted. And since then, the HRMS market has continued to grow and evolve. New technologies such as cloud computing and mobile devices are changing the way businesses operate and requiring HRMS to evolve with changing customer needs. As businesses' needs change, so will the HRMS they use. Types of human resource management systems There are several different types of HRMS on the market, and they vary in features and functionality. Some HRMS are designed for specific industries, while others offer more general-purpose tools. When choosing an HRMS for your business, it’s important to consider your specific needs and requirements; Industry-specific HRMS Some human resource management systems are designed for specific industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing, or retail. These systems offer industry-specific features and tools that can be helpful for businesses in those industries. For example, a healthcare HRMS might include tools for managing compliance with HIPAA regulations. General-purpose HRMS Other HRMS offer more general-purpose tools that can be used by businesses in any industry. These systems might not include industry-specific features, but they can still be helpful for businesses of all types. Cloud-based HRMS Cloud-based systems are hosted by the cloud vendor, and they can be accessed via the internet. Cloud-based HRMS can be helpful for businesses that don’t have the resources to host their own HRMS. On-premises HRMS On-premises HRMS are hosted on the customer’s own servers. On-premises systems can be helpful for businesses that want to have more control over their HRMS. Open-source HRMS Open-source HRMS are free to use, and they can be customized to meet the needs of your business. Open-source HRMS are typically hosted on the customer’s own servers. Proprietary HRMS Proprietary HRMS are developed and owned by a single vendor. Proprietary systems are typically not customizable, and they may be more expensive than other types of HRMS. Why companies should invest in HRMS An HRMS can automate and streamline a few different HR functions, including payroll, benefits administration, and performance management. By automating these processes, an HRMS can save businesses time and money. In addition, an HRMS can help businesses manage their workforce better. There are many benefits you can expect to see when you implement an HRMS. These benefits include; Better, data-driven insights One of the clearest benefits of an HRMS is the ability to gain insights into your workforce that were not possible before. With an HRMS, you can track employee data and use that data to make better decisions about your workforce. Improved compliance Compliance is a never-ending struggle when it comes to HR. By automating HR processes with an HRMS, you can ensure compliance and do away with errors that come about via a manual approach. Reduced costs An HRMS can help reduce the costs associated with HR functions, such as payroll and benefits administration. In addition, an HRMS can help you better manage your workforce, which can lead to reduced turnover and improved productivity. Improved employee satisfaction An HRMS can help improve employee satisfaction by automating HR processes and making it easier for employees to access the information they need. In addition, an HRMS can help you better manage your workforce, which can lead to improved employee morale. Small business HRMS for small business owners is very effective and enables organization and time savings when a small business owner is short on bandwidth. Freeing up this time that a business owner would normally be spending on HR can mean more time for strategy and more needle-moving activities. What are the key functions of an HRMS? While HRMS can vary and will certainly have some level of individuality, there are some core functions you can usually expect. Workforce management Perhaps the cornerstone of any decent HRMS is a workforce management function. This refers to the general overseeing of your workforce and would include everything from development to discipline. Why it matters: Workforce management is critical for every business. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your workforce and can help you save time and money. Payroll Another key function of an HRMS is payroll management . This refers to the process of managing employee pay, including calculating wages, taxes, and deductions. While this may be as simple as basic payroll records, it can be as complex as managing overtime, labor laws, benefits, and even calculating taxation. Why it matters: Payroll is one of the most important aspects of HR. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage payroll and can help you save time and money. Employee management Employee management refers to what most people would consider when they think about HR functions. This would encompass everything from reporting on the relationship between employees and management to the basic structure of your employee’s work life, such as which location they work out of. Why it matters: Employee management is critical for every business. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your workforce and can help you improve employee morale. Recruitment The process of recruitment can be a daunting one, but an HRMS can make it much simpler. This would include everything from posting job ads to conducting interviews and managing the hiring process . Why it matters: Recruitment is a critical part of HR. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your recruitment process and can help you find the best candidates for your business. Employee engagement Employee engagement is a relatively new term, but it’s gaining a lot of traction in the HR world. Employee engagement refers to the level of connection an employee feels to their work and their company. This can be anything from job satisfaction to company loyalty. And the best way to manage employee engagement is by regularly conducting engagement surveys to keep a pulse on how your workers are feeling. Why it matters: Employee engagement is critical for every business. A good HRMS can help you to improve employee engagement and can lead to improved employee morale. What are the key features of an HRMS? Now that we’ve provided clarity on the overriding functions of an HRMS let’s look at the individual features you can expect. Reporting and analytics One of the most important features of an HRMS is reporting and analytics . The system should provide you with data that can help you to make decisions about your workforce. This data can be anything from employee productivity to turnover rates. Why it matters : Reporting and analytics are critical for every business. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage your workforce and can help you save time and money. Centralized employee records A basic feature that you can expect from most HRMS is the ability to store employee records in a centralized location. This is important because it helps streamline the process of managing employee data. Why it matters: Having a centralized database of employee information can save you a lot of time and hassle. It also means you can easily access employee records from anywhere in the world. Performance management Another key feature of an HRMS is performance management. This refers to the ability of the system to help you track and manage employee performance. This can include anything from setting goals to tracking progress. Why it matters: Performance management is important for any business that wants to improve employee productivity. A good HRMS will make it easier to manage employee performance and can help you improve your bottom line. Time and attendance tracking Many HRMS also offer time and attendance tracking features. This refers to the ability of the system to track when employees start and finish work, as well as their break times. Why it matters: Time and attendance tracking ensures accurate recording of work hours, which directly impacts payroll accuracy and compliance with labor laws. This feature helps prevent timekeeping errors and disputes while also providing valuable insights for optimizing scheduling and labor costs. Benefits administration Another common feature of HRMS is benefits administration. This refers to the ability of the system to help you manage employee benefits. This can include anything from health insurance to pension plans. Why it matters: Benefits administration is crucial in HRMS because it ensures that hourly workers have easy access to and understanding of their benefits, which boosts job satisfaction and retention. By streamlining the management of benefits like health insurance and retirement plans, HR systems help reduce errors and save time, allowing HR teams to focus on supporting their employees effectively. Employee self-service Many HRMS also offer employee self-service features. This refers to the ability of employees to access their own records and update their information. Why it matters: Employee self-service is a vital feature because it empowers employees to manage their own schedules, access pay stubs, and update personal information without needing to go through HR, saving time for both the employees and the HR team. This increased autonomy leads to greater job satisfaction and reduces administrative burdens, allowing HR to focus on more strategic tasks. HMRS security Security is a major concern for any business that stores data. This becomes even more salient when it involves personal data of employees like social security numbers and addresses. A data breach would not only raise all kinds of compliance issues but can genuinely harm your employees. That's why it's so important to consider the following security concerns when you prepare to implement an HRMS. Data encryption: One way to protect your data is to encrypt it. That means that even if someone were to gain access to your systems, they would not be able to read the data without the encryption key. Data backups: Another way to protect your data is to have multiple backups in different locations. That way, if one backup is compromised, you still have others to fall back on. Restrict access: It's important to restrict access to your HRMS to only those who absolutely need it. That way, if someone does gain unauthorized access, they will not be able to do as much damage. Two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of security that requires someone to not only know a password but also have physical access to a device like a cell phone to log in. This makes it much harder for someone to gain unauthorized access to your systems. Update regularly: It's important to keep your HRMS up to date with the latest security patches. That way, you can be sure you're as protected as possible from the latest threats. Strong password policies: Finally, it's important to have strong password policies in place. That means requiring employees to use passwords that are long, complex, and unique. How to ensure success when implementing a new HRMS Ready to adopt an HRMS? Here is a checklist of best practices to follow to ensure success when implementing a new HRMS: Define your goals The first step is to define your goals. What do you hope to achieve by implementing a new HRMS? Do you want to improve employee productivity? Save time and money? Attract and retain the best employees? Do your research The next step is to do your research. There are a lot of different HRMS on the market, so it's important to find one that will meet your needs. Be sure to read reviews and compare features before making your final decision. Consider your scope HRMS are not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's important to consider the scope of your project and find a system that will meet your specific needs. Some human resource management systems are broad and comprehensive and will essentially take over a function of your business. But on the other hand, you can find systems that are more limited and focused on one particular area. Get buy-in from stakeholders Another important step is to get buy-in from stakeholders. That means getting the support of upper management and ensuring they understand the benefits of an HRMS. Create a plan Once you have buy-in from stakeholders, it's time to create a plan. This should include a timeline, budget, and a list of key milestones. Train your employees Once you've selected a system, it's important to train your employees on how to use it. A good HRMS will have training materials available, but you may also want to consider hiring a consultant to help with this process. Implement gradually You don't have to go live with your new HRMS all at once. In fact, it might be better to start with a small group of employees and then expand gradually. This will give you time to work out any kinks and make sure that everyone is properly trained. Monitor and adjust Finally, it's important to monitor your new HRMS and adjust as necessary. Pay attention to how employees are using the system and whether they're finding it helpful. If you see any problems, don't hesitate to make changes. The right technology makes a world of difference HRMS are a necessary upgrade for any business that wants to improve its human resources management. By automating HR processes, these systems can save time and money while also improving employee productivity.

My dad is a driver who has worked for the past 40 years delivering parcels for companies, while my mum helped him as she worked part time as a cleaner. My parents had never been to school, finishing 4th grade before being asked by their parents to come out to work. For them, spending each hour earning money made more sense than going to school. I grew up in my dad's van - following him to wake up early in the morning at 4.30 AM so that he could drive one hour to pick up the goods that he needs to deliver for the day. I was always tired and sleepy while he put me next to him as he drove to work. To him, every minute counted as he was paid by the hour. He would always tell me that he needed to get up early to avoid the traffic jams that come in by 7 AM, and that he would finish his $2.50 lunches in 15 minutes so that he could get back to work. He often finished work late in the evening at 8 PM daily and would work 6.5 days each week. My dad's dedication and passion towards hard work made me want to help others in the hourly worker space. There are over 60 million hourly workers in America, and over 2.7 billion globally. The majority of workers in the world are hourly, but they have often been under-appreciated. From hospitality, retail, logistics, agriculture, construction to healthcare, companies like Walmart, GE, Amazon, Safeway, CVS, Delta Airlines, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Uber, DoorDash, Jamba Juice, Marriott, Instacart, and more mainly employ hourly workers. In fact, many companies mainly hire hourly workers, whereas office or full time workers are in the minority. However, when we read the news, it often highlights stories about financial institutions, technology startups and more; when we look at software and software, more are built for office workers, from Slack, Zoom, to Qualtrics. My first job out of high school was as an hourly salesperson, where I sold cable TV subscriptions door to door. While in college, I started a Thai food restaurant, where I needed to hire, onboard and manage hundreds of hourly workers. I grew up in the hourly space and felt the importance of giving back and helping others in the industry be recognized, appreciated, and helped. As the first in my family to go to school, I worked part-time throughout school to pay for myself and was fortunate to be the first in my family to come to America, where I attended school at Harvard University. While at Harvard, I felt like I was provided the opportunity to go to school not just for myself, but for my parents and extended family who all came from a blue-collar background. My friends at Harvard told me about their parents, uncles and aunties who worked as doctors, engineers or entrepreneurs - I have over 20 uncles and aunties, all of who worked either as a taxi driver, vegetable seller, or construction worker. While at Harvard, I felt I was given the opportunity of a lifetime to not just help myself, but my entire extended family. I also felt a responsibility to give back to others who grew up in a similar blue-collar background. In this newsletter, \"The Hourly Worker,\" I hope to be able to share stories and anecdotes about businesses, entrepreneurship, and people in the hourly worker industry and more. With the current COVID-19 global pandemic, it becomes more obvious than ever - hourly workers are the ones at the frontline. Hourly workers are the ones to lost their jobs first. Hourly workers are the ones who run the risks and put their life in danger first. They are the ones we should focus on and the ones we should help. The COVID-19 situation is evolving quickly, and I hope to be able to dedicate this newsletter to help highlight people in the hourly workers industry to help us to appreciate and thank them more. In the past few years, I have worked with businesses from supermarkets, logistics restaurants, hotels, and healthcare companies, helping them to streamline their hiring and onboarding process, including with McDonald's, Brightstar Care, Uber, Jamba Juice, Marriott and more. With this newsletter, I hope to be able to do my part to highlight and share stories about local businesses and hourly workers, to do my part in empowering them to do better work and to better appreciate them. I also plan to feature businesses, entrepreneurs, and hourly workers who work in this industry to spotlight them and to share their stories.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 06/15/23 Hiring Hacks: How to humanize recruiting automation Share this article Everyone is looking to do more with less. Thankfully, advances in recruiting automation are helping HR leaders and hiring managers optimize their hiring process like never before. By implementing an applicant tracking system with automated resume screening, interview scheduling, applicant communication, and more, recruiting teams can save 10s of hours every week. But too heavy of a reliance on automation can come at the expense of a good applicant experience. Lucky for you, you can have your cake and eat it too. By supplementing your recruiting automation process with a few small personalized moments, you can strike the right balance between efficiency and empathy—and create a great hiring experience for applicants and managers alike. Check out our tips in the video below, or keep reading. 1. Create video job descriptions Video job descriptions can connect more with your audience than text. Consider asking a team member to record a short video going over the requirements of your open role. They can also share why they love working at your business or what growth opportunities exist. Ensure your video has clear audio and is short and concise. Beyond including it in your job description, you can share this video on your social platforms or embed it on your career page . Recruiters can even text the link to interested applicants. 2. Use two-way text messaging Times have changed. Nowadays, people go to great lengths to ignore a phone call. If you want to reach applicants, meet them where they are: text messages. And reaching applicants quickly matters. Our data also shows that if employers respond to an applicant within an hour of receiving their application, they have a 25% higher chance of hiring them. 3. Personalize your communications One of the biggest advantages of recruiting automation is the ability to send messages to applicants at all the right touchpoints without having to lift a finger. But too many generic and impersonal messages can make applicants feel like just another number in the system. Tailored messages show applicants you’re a real person and your business cares. So do a mix of both. Automate messages to send at transactional moments, like when you’ve received an application, but take the time to send a personal message after they schedule an interview to show you’re excited to meet them. 4. Give feedback Recruiting automation can also help you send rejection letters to all applicants in your funnel who aren’t hired. And while not having to do that manually is a big time-saver, consider personalizing your rejection letter to applicants you took the time to interview. Taking that extra step to help them understand why they weren’t hired for the position shows you were thoughtful in your selection process, provides areas for self-improvement, and leaves applicants with a more positive experience, even though they didn’t get the job. 5. Create an onboarding video Recruiting automation software can streamline the onboarding process, too , by enabling new hires to complete paperwork digitally before they even have their first day. But even though new hire paperwork is typically pretty sterile and repetitive, you can infuse some personality into the process by working a friendly welcome video into your onboarding workflow. It allows the new hire to familiarize themselves with the manager or business, creates a warm atmosphere, and builds anticipation for their first day. Depending on the onboarding process, you can also include watching the video as a task so you know they’ve watched it and are ready to go on day one. 6. Build a mentorship program Assign mentors to new hires to give them a support system from the start and make it easier to develop a sense of belonging. The early days of any job can include a lot of shadowing or grunt work. Giving new hires a mentor helps them feel more connected as they find their place on the team.  It enables them to acclimate to the organization’s culture, understand their role, and build relationships. This creates a sense of community and connection, reducing feelings of isolation and improving employee engagement from the first day. Keep it human Recruiting automation software has significant advantages but should never come at the cost of human touch. By implementing some of the above strategies, organizations can strike a balance between efficiency and empathy. This will not only enhance the candidate experience but also strengthen employer branding and foster long-term engagement.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 05/17/22 Hire hourly employees faster with texting and automation tools Share this article The competition for hourly workers is stiff. Each pause in the application process increases the chance that a quality candidate will get an interview or an offer from your competitor. And the employer with a more engaging interview process is more likely to win the competition for the applicant’s attention. According to a recent report , 37% of hourly workers say getting hired quickly is more important than pay and being close to home. As a business owner, the best advantage you have in hiring is how fast you can get a qualified candidate from application to first day. So, how can you speed things up and hire the best hourly workers as quickly as possible? By using text and automation tools. In this post, we’ll show you how these tools create a speedy hiring process that benefits both managers and job seekers alike. 1. Make text message communication your new best friend Are you mostly hiring millennial and Gen Z workers? Then you’ll want to adapt how you communicate throughout the hiring process. According to recent survey data , 75% of millennials avoid phone calls because they’re too time-consuming. And some members of Gen Z think email is outdated and painful to use. So, incorporating text messaging into your hiring process is a must. Plus, texts have as high as a 98% open rate and are largely read within the first 90 seconds Sure, texting can feel casual to many of us who didn’t necessarily grow up with it. But it’s the best way to communicate with most of today’s workers. It’s convenient for both you and them—and in today’s world, it’s also a sign of respect for the applicant’s time and schedule. 2. Simplify the application process Most businesses have moved some or all of their job applications online. That's good. But applicants still have to type in your home page, navigate the menu to the hiring section, identify the location they're applying for... that’s asking a lot of them. Put another way: It’s not how they’re already using their phones. Make the process as quick as possible for them. Use text-to-apply features in your job postings (which you can use to send a direct link to the application, or even to initiate a quick application-by-text). Alternatively, you can use QR codes the same way. Just scan and boom!—they’re applying to work at your restaurant. Similarly, keep the job application as brief as possible. If candidates have to go digging for information, a percentage won’t come back—but you can once again use texts to remind them to continue their unfinished applications. 3. Follow up with text to find the right fit The problem with a quick application—from the hiring manager’s perspective, anyway—is the lack of information. Use text messaging to engage your applicants while getting to know them better. Brands such as A&W ask people to send in short video resumes or to film responses to certain application and pre-interview questions. These allow job seekers to show off their personalities in ways that might be more natural or comfortable than written answers—and certainly more insightful than answering yes/no questions. Similarly, you can engage with applicants by sending them videos or interactive media about your workplace, your benefits, your culture. The possibilities here are endless. 4. Schedule interviews ahead of time via text message In our own stress to find quality candidates, we sometimes forget that the process is stressful for them too. Choosing to schedule interviews by text instead of calling can allow candidates to put themselves in the right headspace. And—we can’t stress this enough—if you’re conducting the interview itself by phone or video, schedule it ahead of time by text, rather than simply calling to talk spontaneously. This helps candidates prepare and refresh their memory about the role since they’ve likely applied for multiple jobs. As a bonus: Because you’ve already opened the door to texting, they’ll feel able to contact you instantly if the need arises before or after the interview. Say they’re having technical difficulties, or a doctor’s appointment ran long, or your hiring manager doesn’t show. They can text you to check in, rather than leaving anyone hanging. 5. Follow best practices for engaging by text Just because text messaging is simple and relatively informal, don’t make the mistake of thinking it’s casual and easy. Texting comes with its own best practices, just like any tool, and here are our recommendations: Ask candidates for their permission. Unsolicited texts can feel invasive or unwanted. So, let applicants tell you what they prefer. Include a quick section of the application for candidates to mark their preference for communication, be that text or email (or even a phone call). ID yourself and use a work phone . Anytime you initiate text contact, lead with your name, your position and your company. That tells recipients your message is not spam, and it offers them context for who’s communicating. And by using a work phone, you keep a healthy boundary between your work and your personal life (not to mention not giving your personal number to strangers). Keep it professional. Of course, your text message can be friendly—and if your branding is more casual, you can tailor the formality of your messages to match. But it’s essential to convey professionalism by, for example, using complete sentences and avoiding abbreviations and shorthand. Pay attention to timing—and be timely. Your initial contact should always come during regular business hours (unless the candidate has indicated a different preference in the application). And while you shouldn’t be expected to text outside your own working hours, if a candidate texts you back during your evening shift, by all means, respond. Prompt responses show you are motivated to work with them—and keep the hiring process speedy. 6. Use smart screening That initial process of sifting through applications consumes a lot of time, particularly if the applicant flow is as high as most businesses need it to be. If the application process is electronic and standardized (either by text, via the restaurant’s app or on the website), you can set hiring parameters to screen applicants for basic requirements. More advanced hiring technologies can also help you assess the quality of applications before progressing to the interview stage.  Thus, smart screening takes two basic forms: information gathering to see if candidates meet your basic requirements and personalized responses to engage applicants and to self-filter the ones who are less serious. 7. Automate interview scheduling Another drain on hiring managers is the effort of making back-and-forth calls and texts just to schedule a single interview. Imagine if every applicant who passes the smart screening didn’t have to wait for a follow-up to schedule an interview—but instead, had the option to self-schedule immediately after applying. An automated hiring platform can provide permission-based calendar access to promising candidates so they can schedule an interview with you or your hiring managers during the times you’ve marked as available. The applicants get an immediate confirmation text, and the hiring manager receives a notification that an interview is scheduled. This is how quick-service restaurant Fuzzy’s and Frisch’s schedules applicants in less than two hours . It’s as close to instantaneous as it gets—and it’s how you can get applicants in the door (or on the phone) for interviews without a single moment of logistics work on the manager’s end. 8. Send automatic text confirmations Even with the fast-as-it-gets process, managers still risk no-shows for interviews. An automated system can utilize text confirmations to minimize ghosting and keep managers from sitting around waiting. With text confirmations, applicants automatically receive a text message from the hiring manager shortly before their interview asking them to reply to confirm. If they don’t reply, managers know not to wait for them and can instead refocus their energy on the many other needs demanding their attention. And if a candidate needs to reschedule, that option can be part of the text message, too. This works. Jamba, for example, recently reduced its ghosting rate by 90% by using automation and two-way texting technologies. 9. Preserve the personal touch “Automated,” of course, doesn’t have to mean “impersonal.” Applicants are still human beings, after all, and so are your hiring managers—and an automated system is simply a way to more efficiently get two people talking. To that end, we recommend that hiring managers add appropriate personal touches in their communications so that applicants don’t feel like just another number. Even just using the applicant’s name at the start of correspondence can help, as can making specific positive comments on the experiences and information they share in their application. Final thoughts Being the first to offer applicants a position doesn’t guarantee they’ll take it—but it certainly increases the chance they’ll accept. Plus, a faster, more efficient hiring process streamlines the process for your managers, maximizing their time and effort to focus more on the restaurant’s countless other needs.

However, recent years have seen restaurant managers and owners embrace digital transformation at an increased pace. Restaurants who have embraced modern tools have been able to modernize operations, manage teams, introduce different approaches to scheduling and ultimately offer a better customer experience. If you're managing a restaurant using traditional methods, the following guide can help you out. We will discuss updated technology that can facilitate the growth of your business. Source: Pexels Digital scheduling and employee management software Integrating new technology into your restaurant management model can help divert your focus to growing your business. The technology eliminates tedious, time-consuming jobs by automating procedures. Essentially, research shows that 51% of restaurant operators deem staffing to be the most challenging aspect of the job, whereas 35% believe training is the most difficult. If you're running a restaurant, you can leverage several digital tools to streamline employee management processes. Digital tools help with numerous tasks, such as recruiting new members , assigning shifts, dealing with last-minute shift changes and tracking time spent on shifts. With various platforms and tools, you can automate all these functions and create optimized schedules in just a few minutes. Using these tools, you can instantly create schedules and create rosters. You can also easily keep track of employee attendance time, including the precise hours they worked. This process can help you make an accurate and automated payroll to benefit you and your teams. The digital tools can also help you navigate the wage and hour compliances. The various platforms offer simplified limitations and automation features to certify that your teams do not work for more than the regulated amount of time. You can also get your teams to download the application on their devices. This way, teams can interact and inform each other about shift swaps or any other change in scheduling. Ghost kitchens and online ordering applications Source: Pexels Embracing technology helps you optimize your business processes, and it assists with improving the entire business model. For example, a popular solution provided by technology for restaurants was the creation of ghost kitchens . Ghost kitchens are online-exclusive restaurants that only offer takeaway and delivery orders. Ghost kitchens allow restaurant managers to cut costs, expand their customer base, and create a sustainable, eco-friendly business model. If you invest in a ghost kitchen, the only physical investment is the cost of the kitchen space. However, you can use commercial kitchens, without seating areas, to provide a delivery or takeout-only service. You can also cut costs by sharing the space and ingredients with other ghost kitchens. Lower expenses provide the leeway to expand the menu and give customers more culinary options. Additionally, ghost kitchens will increase your customer base through partnering with delivery services and reaching out to a broader range of customers residing in different regions. Implementing this process allows restaurant managers to create an eco-friendly model. By sharing ingredients and space, you can prevent food waste and conserve energy. Moreover, ghost kitchens are easy to create. You can simply build an online ordering application or partner with a delivery service. Then, develop a website and market the restaurant on social platforms if you have the budget. Kitchen display systems Behind the scenes, restaurant operations can be chaotic. Embracing technology can introduce some organization to your kitchen processes. One way to do that is to add a KDS, or a Kitchen Display System. This technology makes it easier to manage meal coursing and pacing, which benefits customers and servers alike. With a KDS, your kitchen staff can certify that the food is served fresh at the right temperature. This is because the software allows you to manage the range and cook time of all customer orders. The digital boards also help your staff review recipes on a monitor and check orders as they come. The board is also linked to your POS system, thereby integrating automation in the order placement process. Inventory management software You can add an automated and updated inventory management system as another way to cut costs and save ingredients. This system helps you keep track of your stock in real-time. You can also check the number of ingredients that go to waste and modify your menu or recipes accordingly. Moreover, you can leverage AI to make food trend predictions and automate your invoicing process with this system. By doing this, you can automate your inventory, predict the required quantities and schedule orders accordingly. This system can save time and costs and introduce sustainability to your operational model. QR codes for menu access, ordering and payments Restaurants can leverage QR codes to promote their services to customers while abiding by social distancing requirements. The customer can use their phone’s camera to scan the QR codes for easy access to menus, order placement pages and payment methods. They can check menus on their personal devices, make payments with bank applications and place orders conveniently. The most beneficial aspect of QR codes is that they present a no-touch approach, allowing restaurants to offer a safe and hassle-free way for customers to place an order. Wrapping up Modern technology can stabilize the tedious restaurant management processes and help you direct your focus to grow and expand your business. You can embrace modern tech to easily manage your teams, cut costs in different areas, create an eco-friendly business model and provide your customers with maximum convenience. This is the only way to ensure continued growth for your business. TAGS Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

The data managed by an HRIS analyst include employee records, time off, payroll, and other employee information needed in the organization.

If you are to be paid an HRIS analyst salary, here are some key roles you must fulfill.

The result is an optimized, engaged workforce, directly contributing to organizational success and overall system effectiveness. Employee Data Management HRIS platforms offer a comprehensive approach to employee data management , giving HR departments unfettered access to crucial information such as names, addresses, ages, roles, and more. Designed as all-in-one solutions, these systems are equipped to assess the real-time status of employees, facilitating stronger connections between HR and staff.

Further, these robust HRIS systems continually update and manage information, adding an extra layer of efficiency and convenience for management. With features such as these, along with streamlined talent management , investing in a top HRIS system offers a clear return on investment. Features, Functions, and Users of HRIS Systems Every industry has its unique hurdles, and it falls on HR's shoulders to meet these challenges head-on. With HRIS systems like BambooHR and ADP , companies are empowered with default, yet versatile, features including: Compensation Management Organizational Structure Talent Acquisition These core HR functionalities make it straightforward for management to optimize workforce planning and hit business targets. They also provide vital tools for absence management, covering situations such as vacations or sick leaves. Through their user-friendly interfaces, these HRIS platforms standardize policies across the organization. As an HR professional , you'll find that interacting with HRIS software is an integral part of your role, allowing you to focus on strategic initiatives while automating routine tasks. HRIS vs. HRMS vs. HCM : What are their differences? As an HR professional , you have a variety of HR software solutions at your fingertips, far beyond just HRIS systems . From employee management to payroll services , the HR technology landscape offers comprehensive platforms for diverse hr needs . Let's delve into a comparative analysis of HRIS, HRMS , and HCM systems to help guide your next project. HRIS The HRIS systems are the baseline for HR management tasks. The system uses existing talent acquisition , data management , processing, and analysis to overcome challenges in HR as they evolve. An efficient HRIS system can be the perfect option for corporate sites with medium to high workloads and a higher number of management employees. It’s also great for an organization that’s developing at a great pace and requires assistance with managing its workforce and in-house HR-related tasks. The HRIS systems are sophisticated and precise, so there’s little room for error. HRMS HRMS is the second most crucial option for HR professionals who want to improve their resource management. While the HRMS systems are interchangeable with the HRIS systems , some companies prefer the former. The HRMS systems support several HR-related tasks, such as payroll management , time, and labor. HCM HCM is a larger spectrum of tasks that provide business owners with a wider variety of options when managing their workforce. Many consider the HCM system to be a sophisticated option for HR processes , but it is only as effective as its users. Some common characteristics of HCM include their strategic, data-based, and transactional approach. It makes the HCM system the perfect remedy for all HR tasks you might accomplish. What makes Human Resource Systems Challenging? Even the most advanced HRIS platforms become ineffective investments if users lack the skills to leverage key features like employee self-service , time tracking , and performance reviews . The principal hurdle with human resource management systems ( HRMS ) lies in their need to adapt to the unique requirements of diverse industries. An HR platform falls short of its value if it cannot be tailored to meet a company's specific HR needs , whether it's benefits management , attendance tracking , or employee engagement . While the full spectrum of challenges may vary according to your specific situation, here are a few examples you can refer to. Data Privacy Data security remains a paramount concern for organizations across every sector, particularly for mid-sized businesses that are not large enough to have extensive resources dedicated to cybersecurity, yet are big enough to be attractive targets for cyberattacks. The responsibility extends to safeguarding employee information and maintaining a fortified employee database to ward off substantial financial and reputational damage. Most HRIS systems are repositories of sensitive HR data , spanning from payroll processing to employee performance evaluations. The challenge lies not merely in locking down this critical data but also in ensuring controlled access for authorized professionals via self-service portals and specialized HR tools . Therefore, top-tier HRIS systems achieve a fine balance by offering a range of customizable permissions and access settings. These features accommodate various roles throughout the employee lifecycle , from enrollment to offboarding , all while ensuring reliable customer support and timely notifications . Compliance and Regulations Compliance with rules and regulations is pivotal to the long-term viability of any organization, especially those with international operations. As companies scale, compliance becomes exponentially complex, making it imperative to have an efficient HRIS system . Such platforms allow professionals to adeptly manage employee records and payroll software without falling afoul of legal constraints. For a firm that diligently adheres to regulatory mandates, continuous oversight becomes a valuable asset. It simplifies the deployment of KPIs within the HR department , made even more effective through learning management systems ( LMS ) and mobile app capabilities. This results in a more streamlined process for tracking progress and ensures greater compliance with both domestic and international laws. Cloud-Based HRIS: Is it worth it? A digital, cloud-based Human Resource Information System (HRIS) is an invaluable asset, especially for medium-sized businesses that operate in both on-site and remote environments. This SaaS solution goes far beyond the basic functionalities of employee data management ; it offers a plethora of features that often go unnoticed but can significantly elevate your company’s efficiency and people management strategies. Easier Stability Utilizing a cloud-based HRIS solution offers unparalleled scalability and financial flexibility. These platforms effortlessly adapt to your business trajectory, providing rippling benefits across various HR functions , from PTO management to issuing offer letters via templates . The system's agility enhances your overall process, ensuring that adjustments or employee benefits rollouts can be optimized efficiently. Quick and Easy Access to Updates Businesses get access to updates that would be unavailable otherwise. The cloud HRIS systems have a wider client base to cater to, which makes finding innovative solutions a lot more feasible. Bottom Line HRIS systems like Workday , Zenefits , Paycor , and Gusto serve as comprehensive solutions for optimizing talent management and workforce deployment. These platforms excel in assessing, managing, and delivering targeted solutions, ensuring that work day schedules for new employees are efficiently integrated. With the versatility to adapt to various industries, these scalable systems not only simplify HR operations but also offer precise features like automated pay stubs . Choosing the right software for your specific needs will enhance your HR capabilities, yielding a more streamlined operation. Learn More About HRIS: What is HRIS?

Since 1996, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) has awarded countless business owners and hiring managers tax credits for hiring workers from groups who have consistently faced barriers to employment. If you have yet to take advantage of the WOTC program, it’s not too late. In fact, You may already employ workers who qualify and not know it. Let’s take a deeper look at WOTC and how employers can get rewarded for building a more diverse workforce. What is WOTC? The Work Opportunity Tax Credit is a Federal tax credit available for employers who hire and retain individuals from certain target groups who routinely face significant employment barriers (like veterans, SNAP recipients, refugees, or people with a criminal justice background). Depending on which targeted group, employers can claim up to $9,600 per new employee in tax credits from the WOTC program—usually during the first year of an employee’s qualified wages. And there is no limit to the number of employees an employer can claim. This also means there’s no limit to the number of tax credits employers can earn under the WOTC program. Investing in communities Participating in the WOTC program does more than provide employers with a financial incentive through tax credits. It also encourages them to access often underappreciated populations to fill their applicant pool. Without the Work Opportunity Tax Credit program, some hiring managers might never hire a former convict . But those who do are often pleasantly surprised. 82% of managers think that employees with criminal records perform as well or better than workers with clean records. There are several other advantages for businesses that hire employees with criminal backgrounds—like lower-than-average employee turnover and more applicants to choose from. Military veterans , another population that qualifies for the WOTC program, can bring new operational knowledge to your workplace. Quite often , they’re also quick learners familiar with rigorous training programs, following instructions, and managing responsibility. And when members of other disadvantaged groups, like people who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments , can improve their financial prospects through better employment, entire communities can benefit. Although those who qualify for WOTC don’t receive monetary rewards directly from the program itself, WOTC eligibility can make them more attractive job applicants for prospective employers. Yet, despite facts like 20% of new hires potentially qualify for WOTC or that businesses can see up to 40% cash-flow improvement, why aren’t more employers routinely using WOTC? Why don’t more businesses take advantage of WOTC? There are several factors, obstacles, and reasons why more businesses aren’t making the most of WOTC. Typically, an organization's lack of participation can be attributed to at least one of the following: Lack of WOTC awareness Business owners and hiring managers are often too busy (or overwhelmed) with other aspects of day-to-day operations to do the research and learn how to make WOTC work for them. It’s not just that employers fail to conduct WOTC screening or fail to identify candidates who qualify for the program—they might not know that WOTC exists. Tip: If you manage multiple locations, overcommunicate what you know about WOTC and its benefits to all your locations. For a fresh perspective on how you can win at WOTC, check out our insightful webinar with Amy Parman , Director of Training and Recruiting at Taziki’s Cafe. Concerns about WOTC sourcing Many think that sourcing qualified applicants will be too challenging or think they don’t naturally hire enough qualified employees. This is wrong! As we revealed earlier, 20% of new hires qualify for WOTC, but it’s not always obvious and, therefore, easy to overlook. You might discover that an applicant qualifies for WOTC simply because of where they live (being in the Designated Community Resident target group) or because of a family member. Tip: If you’re concerned about your ability to effectively source applicants who qualify for WOTC, partner with a staffing agency that works specifically with underrepresented groups (e.g. Honest Jobs for those affected by the criminal justice system) or look to existing employees for referrals. No time to dedicate to WOTC Like many government programs, applying for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit can be very tedious—especially the first time around. Some business owners put off thinking about WOTC until it's time to file taxes. Which unfortunately happens to coincide with other priorities. To become efficient at claiming WOTC for employees who qualify and really reap the benefits of the program, businesses need a way to automate the process and solicit help from tax experts. Tip: Invest in tools and technologies that turn applying for credits on autopilot for your business. Bonus points if it integrates with your applicant tracking system (or ATS) . For example, WOTC.com will provide you with all the appropriate tax reports for the total amount of tax credits you’ve earned for the appropriate tax year. Only think WOTC is for adults Many business owners and hiring managers are surprised to discover that their seasonal youth employees may qualify for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit program. Only 211 youth employees were hired with WOTC certification in 2020 (.01% of the total), making it the smallest certified category and further demonstrating the missed opportunity. To qualify, summer youth employees must be at least 16 years old, but under 18 on their hire date or May 1, whichever is later. They must also be employed between May 1 and September 15 (not before May 1.) Tip: Residing in an Empowerment Zone (EZ), enterprise community, or renewal community is another qualification for summer youth employees. Use this interactive map to see if a location near your business meets this criterion. The maximum credit for a summer youth employee is $1,200. Strengthen your workforce with diverse hiring Most businesses in the restaurant, hospitality, transportation, or construction industries are likely to qualify for a Work Opportunity Tax Credit. In many situations, those businesses could receive WOTC today just by taking a closer look at their existing employees to see if they fit the criteria. Veterans and people with criminal records usually make up most of your WOTC-qualified target applicant and employee audience, along with SNAP recipients and refugees, depending on your business location. But it will take effort on your behalf to receive a Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The integration between Workstream and WOTC.com now makes vetting new hires for WOTC a seamless, behind-the-scenes part of the application process—with the required WOTC eligibility forms being forwarded automatically within 28 days of the hire.

Employee benefits insurance is one of those products. It’s also called employee benefits liability coverage, among other variations of the name, but they all mean the same thing. Understanding this coverage and how it works can help you protect yourself from any issues during benefits administration. What Is EBL Insurance Coverage? Employee benefits insurance, which is referred to as EBL insurance (Employee Benefits Liability), is purchased by businesses to cover any mistakes or omissions that can occur during the employee benefit plans administration process. This coverage can be applied to health benefits, disability coverage, life insurance, retirement plans, and more. This coverage is usually an endorsement that is added to a general liability policy, but it could be on a fiduciary liability policy or sold as a standalone policy. This coverage ensures that benefits are properly administered, and if not, there is protection for the employee(s) and the company if something was done incorrectly. This is one of three types of insurance required for administering benefits and handling employee funds, along with fiduciary liability, which we’ll talk more about in a minute, and dishonesty coverage. Dishonesty coverage protects companies from the potential theft of benefit plan funds by administrators of the program(s). What Does Employee Benefits Liability Coverage Cover? Employee benefits liability coverage can protect any number of scenarios involving omissions or errors in the benefits process, including the enrollment process, termination of enrollment, benefits explanation, eligibility explanation, advice, and other details. It also refers to the creation and maintenance of records related to benefits programs. Lawsuits could stem from things like: Failing to enroll an employee Failing to correctly explain eligibility Failing to maintain plan enrollees A lack of disclosure in benefit plans Essentially, if there is an error or omission related to the benefits, this coverage provides financial protection for your organization. This coverage also protects employers from Affordable Care Act-related claims and issues. For example, if someone is an independent contractor and they try to say they should be an employee that is eligible for coverage, this policy will protect your business from accidental misclassification and any financial repercussions that come with it. Employers liability insurance is the key. Some of the benefits covered include: ·      Dental ·      Disability ·      Health coverage ·      Life insurance ·      Unemployment coverage ·      Social Security ·      Retirement plans ·      Maternity leave ·      Workers’ compensation ·      Vacation benefits (computer-generated) ·      Etc. This coverage is essential, but it’s not a replacement for a solid risk management strategy that includes proper administration of benefits in the first place. EBL vs. Fiduciary Liability Insurance Some people confuse EBL coverage with fiduciary liability insurance. Although they have some similarities, the former is designed to protect companies from any errors or omissions in a wide range of plans and benefits packages. Fiduciary liability coverage, however, is specifically focused on protecting businesses from wrongful acts related to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Put simply, fiduciary liability is a broader coverage. EBL is focused on administrative errors and omissions, while this coverage protects from breaches of fiduciary duty. It’s also important to note that because of this, many companies offer EBL plans that specifically include language to exclude claims related to ERISA violations. EBL vs. EPL EBL is also different from Employment Practices Liability Insurance, or EPL coverage. This insurance is designed to protect businesses from employment-related claims and the liability associated with them. These can include things like wrongful termination, discrimination, and sexual harassment. EBL reduces liability related to gaps in a commercial liability policy. However, it does not duplicate your general liability coverage. This means that even though the EBL coverage can handle omissions and errors in administration, certain actions are excluded from being covered. For example, if you have insufficient funds to pay your premiums or fund the benefit plan, you’re on your own. You can’t just use EBL coverage to make up the difference. Other exclusions include: Any dishonest, fraudulent, malicious, or criminal acts committed within the liability insurance policy. Poor financial advice or poor HR policies that impact programs and benefits. Lawsuits or claims against federal employees. ERISA violations and qualifying workers’ compensation claims. EPL-related coverage. Property damage or bodily injury that is covered under the general liability policy the company holds. What Are Employee Benefits Liability Coverage Options? The cost of EBL coverage is going to depend on exactly which coverage you choose. The number of employees will determine the cost of the policy, along with other factors. For example, you’ll have a deductible to pay, which is usually around $1,000 per claim filed. Being one of the most affordable deductibles for business insurance is notable, but it’s still a cost you don’t want to have to pay if you can avoid it. It's best to consult a reputable insurance provider to understand the best liability insurance coverage so that you can protect your organization accordingly. Having employee benefits is great, but you need to make sure that you’ve got the right employee benefits insurance to protect them, as well as to protect employees, from potential administrative errors and omissions. Risk Management Is Essential You can’t just purchase employee benefits liability insurance and call it a day. You have to understand how this insurance is a part of your overall risk management strategy and benefits administration. It’s a commercial insurance solution that will protect your company if you’re ever sued for issues with benefits or the administration of them. You still need to take the time to come up with a solid strategy for risk management and all the insurance coverage that you will need as a part of that, including employee benefit insurance. If you are not skilled in risk management and assessment, you might want to again consult your insurance provider or someone who can help you understand how to mitigate risks effectively and reduce the risk of potential liability lawsuits and claims. Mistakes and oversights happen. Human error is a part of business operations. There are some things you cannot plan for or expect, which is why business insurance exists. The right combination of business insurance products will ensure that you are protecting your organization and your employees alike, and delivering the best solutions for risk management. In addition to purchasing EBL coverage, you may also want to consider: Taking the time to train your HR staff or hire a dedicated benefits administrator. This increased focus and training can help reduce the risk of errors and omissions that could lead to costly lawsuits over time. Going over policies and procedures regularly to ensure that everyone is on the same page, things still make sense, and that no one is missing anything important. Talking to your employees about their rights and responsibilities regarding their benefits. After all, while HR can deliver the information and explain it, it’s going to be up to each employee to figure out which plan is best for their needs. Keeping updated on HR laws and regulations that may impact your benefits or the administration of them so that you can change course accordingly. Talk to your insurance provider about your business insurance portfolio and make sure that it includes all levels and types of commercial insurance required by law, including General Liability and all the specialty coverages, like employee benefits insurance coverage. That way, you’ll be protected on all fronts and deliver a better experience for your employees and your benefits administrators alike.

Every company has its policy about the benefits and perks they are willing to offer. Therefore, the best employee benefits may differ for each company and organization depending on their preference. The question is, what are these employee benefits? In this comprehensive article, we will discuss all the details about the best employee benefits in this article and help you better understand them. What are Employee Benefits? Employee benefits are extra perks, bonuses, or incentives the company offers in exchange for loyalty or performance. The employees usually feel more positive, motivated, and dedicated to work when they have access to these benefits. With the benefits offered, the company streamlines its operations, retains its valuable assets better, and lessens churn and overall turnover. Companies like Home Depot have done this flawlessly with their benefits offerings. The HR professional is responsible for offering the best employee benefits, but they can also vary from person to person. The annual salary isn't the only good thing about working full-time or hourly based. Instead, several benefits and perks make the job more exciting and rewarding. Companies that truly value and appreciate their workers understand how essential it is to cater to their needs and provide the best employee benefits. The aim of these employee benefits is mainly two, these include: Retaining employees Attracting potential talent to the company for better output However, employee benefits are so subjective that it can be tricky to understand the full spectrum of these benefits. The standards for good employee benefits vary, but we will still discuss most of them. What are the Best Employee Benefits? One of the best employee benefits are when employees have more control over their overall schedule. Companies with best benefits for their employees experience a lower employee turnover, and companies that resonate with their employee requirements don't have to push too hard to retain them. The best companies are the ones that usually offer the best employee benefits. However, these benefits aren't just for monetary gain. Instead, reputable companies consider their workers' overall well-being and development. For instance, they may try to reduce employee stress in any way possible or improve their health. The company could try to cater to offset living expenses. The companies also cater to the employees regarding their emotional and financial stability. The most common employee benefit examples worldwide include the following: Workplace flexibility Tuition reimbursement Paid leave Mental health services Gym membership reimbursement Free weekday lunches Employee appreciation programs Digital Coaching Childcare assistance or costs reimbursement Affordable health insurance The employee benefits landscape has transformed recently after the pandemic as companies are more inclined towards working flexibility. Many companies have accepted hybrid working models, allowing employees to find better work-life balance. Best Employee Benefits Companies Should Offer You already understand that there's a large spectrum of employee benefits to choose from. 1.     Company Equity Offering company equity is one of the most innovative ways to acquire, attract and retain valuable talent within the industry. Companies need dedicated employees who are willing to stick with them through thick and thin. Company equity is a significant benefit and provides long-term benefits to employers. It creates ownership among employees, feeling they have a role in the company's future. These employees also get a financial incentive when the company grows or succeeds. Thus, these employees will work their best to ensure your company achieves its goals. The company equity can grow with time and yield financial betterment and security for the equity owners for years to come. 2.     Paid Off Working in any corporate environment can be pretty tiring for the employees. Every employee needs mental peace. It can be overwhelming for employees to work consistently without having a safety net. However, paid-offs are the most innovative way to give employees paid time off without endangering their long-term well-being and financial stability. The paid-off policies may vary for each company but are a must for any company that genuinely cares for its employees. The paid leaves can also be in segments of sick leaves, casual leaves, holidays, or other vacations. Companies usually provide their employees the paid off based on the number of days they work, their working skills, and their tenure in the company collectively. 3.     Employee Bonuses and Rewards Employee benefit examples can vary for companies but are the best way to value your employees. There's a variety of rewards and bonuses you can pick from. However, providing the employees with discounts on services or products the company offers is the go-to option. You can even partner with other companies to provide special perks to the employees. The offerings are a more attractive option for the employees, motivating them to stay with the company for longer. 4.     Matching 401k Contributions With the 401k contributions, the employees can deposit a part of their pre-tax income into their retirement account. The retirement account serves as a financial safety net for employees when they get older and can no longer work. You can also choose a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA if your company doesn't agree to the 401k contribution. With these contributions, the employees can quickly boost their accounts and stay on track with their financial goals for the latter part of their life. 5.     Tuition Reimbursement A loyal employee is the most vital asset of any company. If you are someone with an employee with a lot of potentials, you need to ensure their growth. One of the best employee benefits that ensure your employees continue their growth as a professional and an individual is offering tuition reimbursement. This kind of reimbursement is the top-rated one and provides financial assistance for the employee's education in the future. With this benefit, you can assist the employees with their education expenses and ensure they become trained and equipped with training and knowledge that can benefit your company too. Your employee and company can grow together and move the organization in a more fulfilling direction. In some cases, the companies can also offer the education fund as an interest-free loan, ensuring their employees have the financial support needed. 6.     Plans for Employee Growth Employees who don't see a promising future with their current employer will never be a fulfilling resource in the organization. Remember, like the company, the employees also want to grow financially, economically, and as a professional. A company that doesn't offer any plans for employee growth can hardly retain them. The employees generally become unhappy and unsatisfied and end up feeling worthless. Many of these employees may even switch jobs for the best employee benefits available in the market. Losing a good employee resource for this can harm your company's reputation and productivity. Therefore, it's best to plan for their growth and development in advance. It would help if you had clear options for employee growth. You can motivate them, help them find direction, and boost their morale for these goals. 7.      Career Development Training With tools for development as a professional, it might amaze you how many employees can do better. It gives your employees a chance for better engagement, more achievements, and potential improvement in general. For instance, career development training programs are a smart way to ensure your employees can stay on track with their career graph. You don't have to provide these training sessions for free. You can charge some fee for them as well. This way, only serious employees will take this training, and you will know which people wish to grow. 8.     Health Insurance Healthcare costs are one of the biggest concerns, considering the spending on healthcare increased by 2.7% in 2021 alone. Healthy employees are happy employees, so any company that wishes to ensure their employees stay with them should provide health insurance options. The offerings can vary based on your business size, insurance cost, and insurance benefits. However, with the health insurance policy, the employees have lesser absents, higher productivity, and do better overall. If you are unsure of the health insurance benefits a good company should offer, here are the best employee benefits for health. Vision insurance Reduced prescription drug costs Life insurance Health savings accounts (HSA) Health insurance Flexible spending accounts (FSA) Disability insurance Dental Insurance Offering these benefits will show that you genuinely care for the employee's health and are willing to take measures for their long-term safety. 9.     Provide Daily Wellness The benefits offered to the employees monthly may not always be enough. You never know how an employee might feel internally. It can be difficult for companies to assess these employee behaviors 24x7. Fortunately, small gestures of kindness can go a long way for these employees. Offering employees coffee, water or snacks can make them feel valued and boost their morale. With these small day-to-day activities of kindness, you will have higher employee satisfaction and company growth. You can even add lunch to this list as the employees lose focus as their lunch hours approach. By handling their lunch needs, you can better meet their expectations, increase their focus, and perform better in the office. It will also save the employees from long queues, waiting for food, and more. Thus, any company that can afford employee lunch should provide it for free. 10. Mental Health Wellness Programs Mental health has never been a serious concern in the corporate world, but the trends are now changing. Companies are now spending more time and effort to ensure the long-term well-being of their employees. The companies understand that an employee with a troubled mind can never perform as required. Therefore, the companies branch out and assist the employees whenever needed. These include mental health sessions, allowance for mental health, support groups, relaxation activities, and more. Researches indicate that employee who attain these mental health sessions and perks generally have better performance, better results, and are happier. Remember that these perks don't have to be too extensive. Even providing the employees with a space for relaxation can do wonders for their mental health. The employees can take breaks, refresh their minds, and boost their energy levels. Bottom Line Employee benefits for hourly workers are a significant consideration for any employee wishing to join an organization. The management's responsibility is to have the best employee benefits and options ready for their resources. The benefits include monetary growth and the overall wellness and betterment of employees. With some planning, any company can improve employee well-being and ensure better performance. These benefits make the employees feel more valued, assist them in staying with your company for longer, and improve their growth on personal and professional grounds.

However, when it comes to managing an hourly workforce, it's crucial for employers to understand the significant distinctions between these two employment statuses. Furlough vs layoff has implications not only for the employees but also for the employers themselves. By gaining clarity on these concepts, employers can make more informed decisions, maintain compliance with labor laws, and foster stronger relationships with their workforce during times of uncertainty. Furlough vs layoff First, let's establish a clear definition of each term. Employee or company furlough refers to a temporary unpaid leave of absence granted to employees due to economic challenges or business disruptions, typically with the expectation that they will return to work when conditions improve. On the other hand, a layoff involves permanently separating employees from their positions due to factors such as restructuring, financial difficulties, or a decrease in demand for products or services. And company will have to rehire new employees after the mass layoff . While both furloughs and layoffs involve a reduction or cessation of work, they have distinct implications for employees and employers, particularly in terms of job security, benefits, and legal obligations. For full-time , hourly, or part-time workers, these differences can greatly impact their financial stability and well-being. Understanding the nuances of furloughs vs layoffs is especially crucial for employers of the hourly workforce due to several reasons. Firstly, hourly or short-term workers often rely on consistent income to cover their living expenses, making any disruption in employment a significant concern. Secondly, employers must be aware of the legal requirements and responsibilities associated with each status to avoid potential violations of labor laws. Lastly, clear communication and transparency regarding these employment statuses are vital to maintaining employee morale, trust, and loyalty. Throughout this blog post, we will explore the specific implications of furloughs vs layoffs on hourly workers, highlighting the key differences and offering guidance for employers in navigating these circumstances effectively. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of these employment statuses, employers can make informed decisions that prioritize both the welfare of their hourly workforce and the long-term success of their business. So, let's delve deeper into the world of furlough vs layoff , and discover why it is crucial for employers of hourly workers to know the difference and act with empathy, clarity, and foresight during uncertain times. What is furlough? Hourly workers can experience two types of furloughs: reduction of hours or zero hours . In reduction of hours, employers drastically cut the number of hours employees are required to report to work, impacting the payout . The zero-hour furlough typically happens when a business closes temporarily with no certain reopening date or longer period of time . Many restaurants and hotels have implemented this , where employees are still listed as employed on the company workweek roster but are no longer reporting to work. As a salaried employee , you can experience a pay cut when you are furloughed, as long as the pay is consistent from week to week. You can also be given a furlough similar to the zero-hour scheme, where you are technically employed by the company but cannot do any work. Under this type of furloughed employee status, you can find your access to company assets and portals cut off for the duration, such as email or files on the company server but will be eligible for health plan . Now that we’ve gone in-depth into the definition and types of furloughs, what are the other differences between being furloughed and laid-off employees ? Benefits Getting laid off means termination of employment and you are no longer eligible to receive employee benefits from your previous employer. So you will have to look for a new job . However, in some cases, downturn laid-off employees including hourly employees offered a severance package to help blunt the impact of losing their source of income. Be warned though, that accepting a severance package may affect your unemployment benefits as it might affect your eligibility . Going on furlough workers means that you are technically still an employee of the company but are on temporary leave of absence due to the lack of work . And in general are thus still entitled to your benefits and rights, such as healthcare and other health benefits according to the Department of Labor . The extent of the benefits you will receive will vary from employer to employer according to the furlough period , and so must be discussed thoroughly. Employees furloughed due to the coronavirus crisis are also eligible to claim unemployment insurance along with health insurance , thanks to the coronavirus stimulus package recently passed by Congress and the Fair Labor Standards Act . This means an additional $600 a week in financial aid, lasting until the end of July according to the state law . Getting Rehired and Other Means of Employment While you are of course encouraged to go for the job search once laid off , surprisingly, it’s a similar scenario when you get furloughed. You can look for another, more stable job - provided that it’s a permanent position, otherwise you can be found in violation of your employment contract. When furloughed, there is more of a guarantee that once the business finds itself on firm footing again, you’ll be back to normal working conditions due to worker adjustment strategy. This is because you are still technically employed by the company. Once you are laid off , in general you can only go back to work for your previous employer if you go through the hiring process all over again. What’s in It for Employers? Laying off is a drastic way to quickly cut back on operational costs, as you’re decreasing your payroll expenses and also have no need to give benefits. However, this shutdown or reduction in force may end up costing you in the long run, as you scramble to hire competent employees once the company gets back on its feet. Furloughing means you’ll still have some expenses related to your staff, as you may still be doling out benefits or some reduced pay. Still, many companies choose to furlough rather than temporary layoff during the coronavirus pandemic as this means they will still have access to experienced, skilled human resources who won’t need to be trained, once the crisis has passed. In the end, furloughing and laying off still both mean that you’re taking a huge hit to your source of income, while the coronavirus and its repercussions run their course. And for small businesses , both are viable options to help lessen the burden of operational expenses - it’s just a matter of thinking both options through and seeing which is the better fit for your business model and your employees.

In order to attract and retain top performers, it's essential to provide more than just a competitive wage. Here are seven ways you can go beyond pay to create a work environment employees won’t want to leave. 1. Recognize your employees We all appreciate when someone acknowledges the hard work we do. Yet we can all forget to recognize a job well done, especially when we’re facing economic, hiring, and other pressures. One way to do this is to designate one or more of your team’s managers as recognition leaders . These leaders make it a daily part of their work to acknowledge good work, either through spoken acknowledgment of team members’ contributions or more tangible recognition programs. That distinction is worth emphasizing: Tangible rewards signal gratitude beyond words. They are the epitome of “put your money where your mouth is.” To prevent a sense of favoritism, these rewards can be tied to performance benchmarks. For example, an employee who clocks in on time for 20 shifts in a row could be rewarded with a gift card to a store they like. 2. Lead with empathy Leaders are the first touchpoint for keeping good employees and reducing turnover, which is why their treatment of employees is key. In fact, 85% of HR leaders agree that demonstrating empathy is more important now than it ever has been! All leaders in an organization can work (and even take training) to improve how they demonstrate empathy with their teams: Making a reasonable, professional effort to get to know employees improve the personal connection they have with their workday. Treating employees with sensitivity and understanding lets them know you take them seriously—even when you can’t accommodate their requests. Teaching managers and other leaders to see employees as equal people, rather than subordinates, helps them offer direction and guidance rather than issuing orders. Training can also help leadership understand their own implicit biases with multilingual employees, who make up a significant portion of the hourly workforce, thereby making sure that they are given the same considerations and opportunities as all other employees. Empathy helps to build personal rapport between management and other team members, which will ultimately reduce turnover. After all, people want to work where they feel valued. 3. Provide comprehensive benefits Most hourly employees don’t receive benefits from their employers. But employers who do offer comprehensive benefits find their workers stay with them longer. Starbucks experiences a 65% turnover rate —essentially half that of the QSR average. A primary reason behind their low turnover rate is Starbucks' comprehensive benefits package, through which every eligible U.S. employee, regardless of full or part-time status, receives complete tuition coverage for a bachelor’s degree through Arizona State University’s online program. Yes, these efforts cost money. But so does a high turnover rate! 4. Prioritize employees’ needs According to McDonald’s EVP and Chief Global Impact Officer , the top reason workers leave their jobs is a lack of sufficient childcare. This is all the more significant because parents account for more than one-third of the foodservice workforce . Employers can retain more than one-third of their workers by providing better access to childcare: flexible scheduling, for example, or a childcare stipend. But employees have other needs as well. And they are more likely to stick with a company that goes the extra mile to understand those needs and then shows its appreciation by providing resources to help them. A couple examples include: A scheduling program, updated in real-time, that the Millennial/GenZ workforce can easily access from their phones. Receiving on-demand/daily pay instead of having to wait two weeks between pay periods. 5. Respect and enable a healthy home/work balance Your employees have lives and needs outside of the workplace, and today’s employees want to know you’ll have their back outside of work, too. Let’s face it: Employees who can adequately tend to their home and personal lives will be happier, more focused workers. This is especially true in industries with traditionally high turnover rates, like quick service restaurants, which can lead to employees working understaffed shifts, covering other shifts, and experiencing burnout. Here are some ways you can level up your approach to time away from work, and the quality of that time: Consider giving all employees the gift of paid days off for their birthday and work anniversary. Introduce performance-based incentives with high-value returns like concert tickets or travel stipends. Offer parental leave, sick leave, and short-term disability leave to empower employees to care for themselves and their families without having to choose between work and wellness. Accommodate the needs of all employees by allowing job-sharing and offering full-time, part-time, and flexible schedules as needed. 6. Offer custom perks If you have the above bases covered, you can go above and beyond by providing perk stipends. These are often relatively low-cost programs that enable employees to improve their quality of life without impacting their hourly wage. Many companies offer a suite of options, so employees can use the benefits that are most meaningful to them. Such tactics create exceptional experiences for your teams, and they actively build your culture and your reputation for thinking creatively and supporting your workers. 7. Invest in employee development Many QSRs and other hourly employers have long resisted paying for employee development programs. But now that most QSR owners have experienced the true cost of rehiring for a role, the industry is realizing that employee development is an investment rather than an expense. Professional development doesn’t have to mean sending workers to college (though it can). It’s alright, and sensible, for the training to relate to the employees’ role (both present and future) within the business. Make your business a great place to work Of course, workers take jobs because they need an income. But every job offers money. You can differentiate your organization and retain your employees by providing meaningful support that goes beyond a competitive hourly wage. Focus on the seven tips we’ve shared in this post, and you'll soon spend less time vetting and hiring new applicants and more time retaining and developing your top employees.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, almost 11 million jobs remain unfilled. But it’s not that hourly workers resist working hard or solely focus on chasing that higher salary—they might just be feeling unfulfilled. The needs of the hourly workforce have been overlooked for too long. Feeling unappreciated, unseen, and uninspired, hourly workers (who comprise 80% of today's global workforce ) are doing something about it, as evidenced by the 150% turnover rate among the hourly workforce. Many feel forced to switch employers or industries to gain a sense of career growth. 80% of toady's global workforce is comprised of hourly workers 150% turnover rate among hourly workforce Rather than address this, many employers have started to view turnover as another cost of doing business. But with each new hire costing an average of $4,600 to acquire and onboard, this turnover is more than an inconvenience. It quickly becomes a financial strain that’s harmful to business. In a competitive job market, hourly employees can no longer be treated as a churn-and-burn commodity. The most obvious solution is this: employees will stick around if they feel supported and believe they can build a career with you. When we think of people as a future workforce pipeline rather than temporary workers, we create an employee experience that fosters growth and opportunity. In this guide, we’ll show you how you can become a best-in-class employer by fostering a work environment where hourly workers can grow—ultimately lowering turnover, encouraging loyalty, and creating staffing stability. Let’s look at the four workplace factors that help attract and retain hourly workers Career advancement A common misconception in the hourly workforce is that employees always chase money and will jump from employer to employer in pursuit of a higher wage. But according to the research shared in a BCG Deskless Worker Sentiment Survey , respondents valued opportunity over pay. Among hourly workers who said they might leave their jobs, 41% cited their employer’s lack of career advancement as the reason, versus 30% of respondents who mentioned pay. 41% of hourly workers would leave their jobs over lack of career advancement 30% would leave because of pay Career advancement isn’t just about getting job opportunities with more prestige or clout. It can also be the pursuit of a rewarding challenge, personal growth, or simply the need for change. If a job looks like a dead end, people seeking a sense of satisfaction from work will soon move on. Tip: Be clear about career advancement opportunities If employee retention is important to your business, demonstrate to your potential hire, as well as your existing workforce, how career growth is a viable (and highly visible) benefit. This means talking about career advancement as early as your job description. Go beyond simply saying there are opportunities for career advancement. Be explicit: Describe what future roles the job can grow into Let applicants know what skills they can acquire on the job Mention any training programs or certifications that come with the job According to a 2022 Great Attrition, Great Attraction 2.0 Global Survey by McKinsey , employees are no longer willing to stay in roles with no clear path for advancement: 41% said they quit their previous job for lack of career development/advancement and 31% for lack of meaningful work. 41% of workers quick their previous job due to lack of career advancement 30% quit due to lack of meaningful work Give people reasons to choose your job by showing opportunities it gives them. Because when you don't, your potential and current employees just might find new jobs that will. \"In a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.\" - Warren Buffet, business magnate, investor, and philanthropist Flexibility and autonomy Prompted by the mandated office closures of early 2020, business professionals started working remotely en masse. Even as the pandemic subsided, many businesses continued to offer their employees flexibility and autonomy over their work lives with the choice of remote or hybrid schedules. Simply because the hourly workforce often can’t work remotely doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t expect (or deserve) flexibility of their own. In fact, 47% of hourly workers would rather work for an organization that provides flexible scheduling and/or increased autonomy over one able to pay 10% more. 87% of employees now expect their employer to help them find a balance between their work and personal obligations. 47% of hourly workers value flexibility over pay 87% of workers expect employers to support work-life balance Tip: Give your employees a say in how they work In an employee-driven labor market defined by record-breaking turnover , most hourly workers realize that they make essential services possible. And they know they have options. Since working from home isn't a possibility for many hourly jobs, companies must come up with other ways to offer autonomy. Working how you want is often as important as working where you want. Demonstrate this by: Empowering hourly workers to make some decisions without your approval Rewarding teams when they improve existing processes or procedures Getting creative where you can with work scheduling and shift flexibility As a general rule, managers must deepen their understanding of what hourly workers actually need. Ask if they're enjoying enough independence on the job and which things they'd like to change. Embrace the idea that every employee is different and might have different approaches to work. Flexibility and autonomy in the workplace is based on the notion that you trust your hourly workers to get things done. And the more you trust your people, the more likely they'll feel engaged at work. \"Giving employees control over when, where, and how they work, is key to attracting and retaining talent.\" - Arvind Malhotra, future of work expert and UNC professor Skill development When comparing possible employers, job seekers look for positions that either match their experience and strengths, or offer the opportunity to build new skills. One Gallup survey found that jobs which offer skill development hold greater value to younger generations—with 87% of millennials citing development in a job as important. 87% of millenials want skill development on the job People don’t want to find themselves committed to a new job without a sense of connection to the work. Without alignment to their goals or current skills, they ultimately move on to something more fulfilling. Tip: Create a culture of learning If potential employees are looking for a career they can grow into, stand out from your competitors by: Creating training or skill development programs to empower hourly workers Encouraging your staff to try new things and build new skills on the job Offering rotations into different roles or the ability to job shadow others Doing so can help your organization find greater appeal among the career-minded applicants—the people who are able and willing to see the big picture. This is how you attract employees who are focused on how they can contribute to your success, not just how your job suits their needs. Candidates who prioritize skill alignment and development aren't just better employees. They're more engaged employees—which can mean they're 87% less likely to resign from their jobs. \"I am convinced that nothing we do is more important than hiring and developing people. At the end of the day, you bet on people, not on strategies.\" - Lawrence Bossidy, author and former business executive Good leadership The support, guidance, and leadership of a good manager makes a big difference—particularly for employees within the hourly workforce. This takes proven people skills, the ability to communicate effectively with hourly workers, and the confidence to provide constructive feedback. However, not all frontline leaders exhibit these attributes. Within many organizations, managers are almost entirely promoted from within without much guidance on how to transition from individual contributor to people leader. New frontline managers may quickly grasp new responsibilities around team scheduling and hitting quotas but don't know what it takes to support and grow their teams. Without the right training, frontline leaders are often ineffective at motivating their teams or giving them a structured work environment—two reasons why good people leave. Tip: Train your managers Help reassure job seekers and new hires that management has their best interests in mind. Provide on-site leadership training for managers at least once a year Tie managers' performance reviews to retention rates on their team's feedback Help managers build soft skills like empathy to improve relationships As you continue to train your managers in the fundamentals of people leadership, encourage them to foster a supportive work environment for their teams. Managers should conduct regular 1:1 conversations with everyone (not just for corrective action) and show them how to advance. Supportive managers also know how and when to recognize employee achievements—both big and small. When personal growth is encouraged, people feel more connected to the workplace. \"The single biggest way to impact an organization is to focus on leadership development. There is almost no limit to the potential of an organization that recruits good people, raises them up as leaders and continually develops them.\" - John Maxwell, best-selling author and leadership expert Show your employees you care, and they'll stick around Most hourly workers would prefer staying with the same employer rather than routinely changing jobs to gain career growth. Making the hourly workforce aware of the unique benefits you're already providing puts your organization at a greater advantage. In too many cases, applicants and current employees aren't aware of the great investments businesses are making to provide better work environments. Build great programs. Treat your team right. And shout it from the rooftops. Ready to hire hourly workers who are in it for the long haul?
