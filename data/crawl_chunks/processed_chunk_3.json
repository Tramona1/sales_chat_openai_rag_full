From getting ghosted by candidates to wading through a swamp of resumes, these challenges can slow down your operations and impact productivity. But you don't have to wake up every night in a cold sweat. Keep reading to learn how to overcome some of the scariest aspects of hiring hourly workers. 1. The Invisible Listing Ever post a job and feel like no one even sees it? The Invisible Listing is when your job posting doesn’t reach the right candidates—especially crucial when hiring hourly workers who may be looking for immediate employment or flexible schedules . To solve this, it’s essential to optimize your job listings for mobile devices and personalize them with specific details that speak to your target audience. Most hourly workers look for flexibility, growth opportunities, and clear role descriptions—so make sure your listings reflect that. 2. The Application Apparition When applicants seem perfect but vanish before they make it to the interview , it’s what we call the Application Apparition. This is especially common with hourly workers who may be juggling multiple job applications and immediate needs. By responding quickly to applications and using text-based communication, you can stay top of mind for your candidates. Automated tools help ensure your message doesn’t get lost, and candidates stay engaged in the process . 3. The Disarrachnid Disorganization in the hiring and onboarding process is a nightmare for any manager, but it’s particularly painful when hiring hourly workers. Paperwork, missed deadlines, and communication breakdowns can quickly create a web of confusion. The solution? Digitize and automate. Restaurant operators can simplify the hiring of hourly workers by using software that manages applicant tracking, interview scheduling, and onboarding all in one place. And if you can find a platform that also manages shift scheduling, time clocks, and payroll, you'll spare yourself from even more nightmares down the line . 4. The Headless Hourly Worker When hourly workers are missing the necessary skills they need to perform on the job, it can feel like they're running around with their head cut off—causing more harm than good. Whether it’s a lack of specific skills or poor cultural fit, these mismatches can lead to high turnover and wasted time for your hiring managers. To avoid this, use an applicant tracking system that automatically filters out applicants who don't meet your necessary skill requirements. Afraid of candidates lying on their application? Include skill assessments or practical exercises during the hiring process to ensure applicants have the skills they say they do. 5. The Turnover Terror High turnover is a nightmare for any QSR business, especially when it comes to hourly workers who tend to switch jobs more frequently. To minimize turnover, focus on employee engagement , recognition, and opportunities for growth. Make sure to offer competitive wages , provide clear paths for advancement, and create a positive work culture that values its employees. By building strong relationships with your hourly workers, you can reduce turnover and boost retention. 6. The Compliance Cretin You've probably heard of the Compliance Cretin reeling its ugly head when it comes to payroll and hourly labor laws, but the nightmare actually beings during the hiring process. Hourly workers are protected under Equal Employment Opportunity laws , which prevent hiring discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information. And when it comes to onboarding and new hire paperwork , ensuring everything is correct is crucial. Missing or incomplete records can result in non-compliance with FLSA and other labor laws. And misclassifying workers when you're setting up their worker records will haunt you as soon as their first payday hits. To avoid these terrors, ensure you're using a digital onboarding system that makes it easy to keep worker records up to date and accurate with automatic reminders and integrations with your other HR tools. 7. The Reputation Repulsion Your reputation as an employer plays a huge role in attracting top applicants—especially hourly workers who rely on word of mouth and online reviews when looking for jobs. To enhance your reputation, focus on building a strong employer brand that highlights what makes your restaurant a great place to work. Regularly monitor online reviews and engage with your community to create a positive image. Sleep better at night The world of hiring hourly workers doesn’t have to be full of nightmares. By addressing the challenges that come with recruiting and managing these essential employees and by leveraging the right tools, you can streamline your hiring process, reduce turnover, and build a thriving team.

A combination of rising operational costs, changing consumer habits, and economic uncertainty is squeezing the industry more than we’ve seen since the mortgage crisis of 2007-2009.  For HR managers and restaurant business owners, controlling labor costs and optimizing workforce management have become key to survival. Why are so many restaurants filing for bankruptcy? Several factors have contributed: Inflation and rising costs : Food, rent, and utilities have all become more expensive, putting pressure on restaurant margins and consumer spending. Low unemployment and wage increases : Finding and keeping hourly workers has become more expensive, often leading to over-reliance on overtime and the incremental cost of training new employees. Shifting consumer behaviors : With more people dining at home or opting for takeout and delivery, traditional dine-in models have been strained. While these issues might seem out of the control of restaurant owners, there are things you can do to protect margins and maintain a competitive advantage.  At Vitaligent, a franchise group of 94 Jamba and 2 Cinnabon locations, we deployed these strategies to offset the impact of minimum wage increases while delivering best-in-class same-store sales growth and guest satisfaction (OSAT). 1. Control labor costs by reducing overtime and penalties We all know overtime can sneak up on you—especially when your team is stretched thin and you’re trying to maintain service levels. But over time, those extra hours add up to significant costs that cut into your already-tight margins. Beyond the financial hit, there’s the toll on your team. Burnout from excessive overtime can lead to lower productivity, higher turnover, and mistakes—none of which help when you’re trying to run a smooth operation. How to fix it : A good workforce management system can help you track employee hours in real time, making it easier to prevent unnecessary overtime. And when you automate your scheduling , you can optimize the number of people on the clock and the number of hours they work. Bonus? It also helps you stay compliant with labor laws and avoid costly payroll mistakes. 2. Avoid overstaffing with smarter scheduling Scheduling is both art and science, and mastering it is crucial to avoiding overtime. On one hand, you need enough staff to keep up with demand and deliver great customer service. On the other, you don’t want to overstaff and pay for unproductive labor during slow periods. Add in the unpredictability of employee availability, last-minute call-ins, and fluctuating customer traffic, and creating the perfect schedule can feel like a throw of the dice. Relying on gut instinct or simply copying last week’s schedule doesn’t account for these ups and downs, leaving you either overstaffed and wasting money or understaffed and scrambling to keep up. And when you’re already walking a fine line with profit margins, small missteps in scheduling can have a big financial impact. How to fix it: Rather than reacting to shifts as they happen, take a proactive approach by analyzing past sales data and identifying your busiest times. By scheduling more staff during those high-traffic hours and fewer during slower periods, you can avoid the panic of being understaffed (and the temptation to keep people on the clock longer than needed). 3. Cross-train your staff for flexibility The ability to shift employees between roles is key to keeping operations running smoothly, especially when business is unpredictable. Cross-training can reduce dependency on overtime and give you more options when someone calls in sick. Encouraging your team members to build new skills also serves the added benefit of reducing turnover. When hourly workers see their job as an opportunity to grow, they’re more likely to stay with you. How to do it: Create a structured cross-training program that encourages employees to learn new roles. This not only boosts flexibility but also enhances employee engagement by giving employees the chance to learn new skills and become leaders as they mentor their peers . 4. Leverage part-time and seasonal workers Relying only on a full-time workforce might seem convenient, but when business fluctuates—like during seasonal spikes or slower off-peak dayparts—it can drive up costs unnecessarily. How to fix it: Part-time and seasonal workers provide flexibility , allowing you to scale your workforce up or down based on demand. For example, you can schedule your part-time to cover lunch or dinner peaks or hire seasonal staff for the busiest holiday periods. By blending both full-time and flexible workers, you can reduce labor costs without compromising service quality during peak times. The right technology can help. With an integrated HR system , you can tag applicants or past employees who would be a good fit for part-time or seasonal work, making it easier to bring them on when you’re ready. 5. Invest in employee retention Turnover in the restaurant industry is high, and the cost of recruiting and training new staff can pile up.  Plus, experienced employees are more efficient, understand your workflow, and require less supervision, which boosts overall productivity. Investing in retention means you’re keeping the knowledge and skills within your business, reducing onboarding costs. Additionally, retaining staff fosters a positive workplace culture, which improves team morale and contributes to better customer service. How to do it: To improve retention, offer employees opportunities for growth, like promotions or skill development programs. When staff see a clear path for advancement, they’re more likely to stay engaged and grow with you. A workplace culture that values its employees goes a long way to reducing turnover, cutting down on recruitment costs, and fostering a loyal, high-performing team . 6. Optimize time tracking and payroll Tracking time for hourly workers can be a challenge—especially when employees forget to clock in or out, miss breaks, or punch in early. These seemingly small mistakes can have big consequences for your payroll. If employees are inaccurately recording their hours, you are paying out more than you should, cutting into your profits. And it’s not just about overpaying—fixing these mistakes is time-consuming, requiring manual adjustments and double-checking. At best, this is a distraction for your management team; at worst, it can leave you exposed to costly compliance issues, like failing to meet labor law requirements around breaks and shift lengths. How to fix it: Automating time tracking with a system that integrates directly into your payroll is essential for preventing these errors. By using digital time clocks that sync with your payroll software, you can ensure that hours worked are accurately recorded, breaks are tracked, and compliance is maintained. Look for a system that autoflags any suspicious entries so you can more easily catch issues with clock-ins, clock-outs, and overtime. This saves you time and reduces the risk of overpayment and penalties. Building a resilient future While the restaurant industry is facing unprecedented challenges, there are steps you can take to make your business more resilient. By focusing on efficient workforce management—reducing overtime and penalties, avoiding overstaffing, and improving retention—you can keep labor costs under control and position your restaurant to thrive in the face of adversity.

Thirty years ago, I said restaurants were in the business of serving food and delivering an experience. Twenty years ago, I added that restaurants were in the business of hiring and training people to deliver the food and service experience. Ten years ago, I began saying that restaurants are in the technology business, enabling people to staff and run restaurants better so that food servers can deliver the food and dining experience. Workstream is an example of a disruptive, convenient, and easy-to-use technology that enables restaurants to source, screen, select, and start employees quickly and efficiently. As we move through the pandemic and beyond, nothing is more important for restaurants than finding and hiring the right employees quickly to drive your business forward. Jim Mizes | Former President and CEO, Blaze Pizza As a 40+ year restauranter, I have been the beneficiary of so many entrepreneurs and restaurant operators who have paid forward their lessons learned and best practices. In turn, I have done the same, sharing my experiences as well as the innovative, best-in-class technologies I’ve come across that solve meaningful problems for our industry. Our industry, after all, is full of challenges. Over time, many have stayed persistent and even become more complex. Specifically, our ability to efficiently source and hire hospitality talent is more challenging today than it has ever been—and this was also true before the pandemic. Fortunately, this is one of the challenges that is being solved through technology. For many years, single-unit restaurateurs and smaller multi-unit operators were materially disadvantaged compared to the very large companies with the resources to develop proprietary technology solutions which provided them competitive advantages. That is, until now. With Workstream, local businesses now have the technology they need to find, hire and onboard talent, saving time and improving the quality of the entire process. How you hire and engage with prospective employees is crucial to the success of your business, and with Workstream—and the insights they’ve gathered from the many businesses they serve— you’ll be better equipped to solve the hiring crisis. David Gilbert | Former COO, National Restaurant Association Here's to your next hire Hiring hourly workers is one of the biggest challenges local businesses face, and not just today. Finding qualified candidates and retaining enthusiastic team members has been difficult for years, and it’s becoming harder as the competition for talent continues to increase. Today, almost every local business has a “now hiring” sign in its window, which means that candidates have plenty of employment options. It also means that you’re competing on a much bigger field. Candidates looking for their next opportunity are choosing the companies that give them the best hiring experience. And that starts with you. How you engage with applicants—from the words you use in your job posting to how quickly you respond to applications—shows how much you value them, and can change the trajectory of your hiring success. That’s why we’ve written this book: to empower you to hire faster, better, smarter. We hope you enjoy these hiring insights and best practices from local businesses and top brands. Here’s to your next hire! Desmond Lim | Co-founder and CEO, Workstream Take a proactive approach to finding qualified candidates Half of local businesses say finding qualified talent has gotten harder compared to a year ago. A third also say they have open roles they haven’t been able to fill for at least three months. To say hiring is difficult is an understatement. Luckily, there are several things you can do to actively fill your roles with top talent. Write a job posting As one of the first branded experiences you will offer your potential hires, your job posting should speak directly to your audience in a consistent voice that resonates with how you communicate with your existing team. You have one chance to make a good first impression, so let’s make it count . Let’s start at the top with the title. Having the right keywords in the title of your posting is one of the most important elements to search engine success. Have the right keywords, and your posting will rank higher in searches, driving more traffic to your open role. While drawing more eyes to your job posting is great , getting your ideal candidate interested in it is better. Use this top-line real estate to make your open role stand out above the others. One way to do this is to include a benefit or perk next to the title. Here are a few examples: Restaurant General Manager Chicago - Never Work Sundays Full-Time Registered Nurse - $1,000 Sign-On Bonus Hotel Housekeepers and Room Attendants - Full Health Coverage Once you’ve landed on a title, follow it up with a compelling introduction to your company’s vision and typical collaboration process. When writing the description , use common terms and be transparent about the role’s requirements, qualifications, compensation and duration (if applicable). This allows candidates to get an accurate understanding of the role and gives you an opportunity to share a bit about the team and company to attract candidates that align with your mission, values and goals. This is a lot of information for you to consider including in your job posting. As you build out job descriptions, be as clear and as brief as you can. More than 60% of applicants search for jobs on their phones, so it’s best to review and trim down your job posting, using short bullet points where functional. Essential pieces to include when writing your job description Job title: Name of the position Wage: Composition levels, including minimum and maximum pay Position type and expected hours of work: Details about the work hours, including whether it's full-time or part-time, the typical work hours and shifts, days of the week and if overtime is expected Expected start date: Date when you expect the employee to be available Key responsibilities: Details about the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities of the role Competency: The skills and abilities required for the employee to perform the tasks of the job Work environment: The environment the employee will be working in, such as if it's outdoor Physical demands: The physical demands of the job, including bending, sitting, lifting, and driving Required education and experience: Level of education or experience the candidate must have Additional eligibility qualifications: Any additional requirements, such as certifications, industry-specific experience and experience working with job-related equipment (e.g. forklift operations, short-order cook, phone operations) Affirmative action plan/equal employment opportunity (AAP/EEO) statement: Your stance on equal opportunity employment (which should also be included in your hiring packet or employee handbook, along with other similar statements) Promote your job opening Now that your job posting is written, it’s time to publish it. To optimize its performance, consider your hiring demographic’s daily schedule and commute for cues on when to best get their attention. Also think about how to get their attention. Let’s shift back into the conversation about demographics. A large portion of today’s workforce is made up of millennials and Generation Z . In fact, millennials are currently the largest generation in the U.S. labor force, and Gen Z will be filling internships and entry-level roles for years to come. Gen Z is the first generation of digital natives, having interacted with mobile devices, touch screens, voice computing and apps since childhood. These job seekers not only understand digital technology and social media platforms, but they also appreciate the fact that a digital world makes life easier and more flexible. It’s important for you to meet them where they are: on their phones. \"I put [a text-to-apply poster] up at 8 p.m. one night and by 8 a.m. the next morning, there were 34 applicants. Two days later, we have eight brand new hires.\" Greg Reheis | Operator, Cinnabon There are several ways you can do this. For example, you can directly reach your offline Gen Z patrons and easily convert them into informed team members by offering a text-to-apply option. Easily incorporated into posters, flyers, emails and even receipts , text-to-apply allows job seekers to start their application process by texting a unique short code directly from their phone. You can also actively promote your role (e.g. Cook) by posting the open role in social media groups created for the role you’re hiring (e.g. a Facebook group for cooks). Another way to promote your open role is through a referral program . More than 60% of Generation Z prefers and relies on referrals from an employer’s current or former employees as their most trusted job-search source. Referred candidates are hired faster, through a less costly process and stay with their company longer than traditional candidates. Cast a wider, more reliable net by sharing text-to-apply opportunities with current employees, specific professional connections on social media and even friends and family who might be personally invested in the success of your brand or business. Promoting your open role doesn’t mean listing it on a job board. There are several strategies and tactics you can use to draw in the right candidate—faster. Employee referral programs improve applicant flow—and retention Buffalo Wild Wings franchisees using Workstream's referral tool saw a 5x increase in applicants when they offered employees a $200 referral bonus. Get more tips on how to build your employee referral program. Finding qualified talent takes a little creativity Upload your job posting to a job board, but don't stop there. Here are a few other proven strategies: Organize a hiring party Incentivize staff with an employee referral program Film catchy recruiting videos Highlight your job opening on customer receipts Share open positions on social media List the opening in your company newsletters Host a recruiting webinar \"Workstream is the ultimate solution to reduce ghosting. It fixed inefficiencies, and cut time to hire in half.\" Jaya Varheese | Dunkin', Jersey Mike's, Baskin Robbins Increase applicant interest—and win them over— with early engagement At its core, applicant engagement keeps candidates informed during every step of the hiring process. It’s an important part of the hiring practice because it increases applicants’ interest in your company. And that matters because you’re not the only business that’s hiring. We’re living in a candidate’s job market, which means that candidates aren’t competing with each other for top roles. In fact, it’s just the opposite. Companies are competing for top talent. To be competitive—and ultimately fill jobs faster, you need to be very intentional about how you interact with each applicant. Afterall, you’re building a relationship that you hope will last far beyond an initial interview. Reach out immediately Once the applications start to roll in, respond quickly by using an applicant tracking system (ATS) to stay in touch with applicants through text and email. Reaching candidates by text could solve the larger problem of getting the candidate and the recruiter connected quickly. (Unfortunately, the fault lives on both sides of the fence.) Immediate communication is critical. More than 80% of candidates expect a two-week hiring process at most, while the hiring process today, unfortunately, takes longer than ever. To close the gap, employers and job seekers should engage using methods that have proven to be most effective. Texting provides a layer of personal space by giving the recipient room to respond when they find free time, without undermining the importance of the message. Even the most direct emails can be caught up in spam filters, but push notifications for texts are often turned on by default. With phones so deeply ingrained into our everyday lives, texting can break down a barrier to entry for those who have prioritized getting the job. When it comes to hiring new talent, technology adoption can itself be a selling point for your organization. If your business is using modern, efficient technology, it markets you well. With 86% of reported candidates feeling positive about getting text messages during the interview process, the odds are in your favor. “Workstream saves us a lot of time spent communicating back and forth with applicants by using text messages.” Daljit Hundal | Owner of Jama, Carl’s Jr., Pieology Streamline the hiring process by using a screening questionnaire Managing a team and running a business takes a lot of time and energy. Preserve your schedule by only interviewing candidates who meet minimum requirements for your open role. Identify the role’s criteria, and build it into your screening questionnaire. Use an applicant tracking system to automate the screening process for you. Common pre-screening questions to include: Are you legally eligible to work in the US? If offered the position, how soon are you able to start? Do you have reliable transportation to and from work? “Every time a new applicant comes in, they get filtered through questions before they reach our district manager. This saves our district managers a lot of time!” Philip Hsia | Jack in the Box, Operator (7+ locations) Increase productivity by using technology Consistent contact is key in recruiting. More than two-thirds (67%) of candidates in the current market turn down job offers because they accepted another offer while waiting to hear about a preferred role. So, once they’ve started on this journey, it’s up to you to secure the best leads before competitors do. Automated interview scheduling helps companies meet top talent faster by eliminating candidate loss caused by unnecessary back-and-forth emails and phone calls. Automating interview scheduling gives you a first-mover advantage in hiring top talent. It also gives you back your time—a lot of it. Hiring managers and recruiters typically take 1.5 hours to schedule one interview, and that adds up. Using technology to automate processes like interview scheduling frees your schedule so you can tackle other priorities and focus on your team. Make the most of your calendar Is your team involved in the interviewing process? Leave comments on your calendar appointments to share special instructions and relevant documents with your team. For example, you can remind a hiring manager to ask for references or attach references previously collected. Discover other calendar productivity hacks. Interviewing will always be a part of your schedule, so keep a regular interview cadence blocked off in your calendar. When you block this time on your calendar ahead of time, incoming appointments become less disruptive to your workday. Also, reserve time to predict and manage inevitable churn. The annual churn rate for hourly workers is 49%, meaning that half of your hourly staff likely churns every single year. In some industries, like hospitality, the churn rate jumps to 130%, so it’s easy to feel like you’re constantly hiring. Building working time into your schedule to solve both of these challenges will help you—and your team—reduce both the direct and indirect stresses associated with hiring. Ask the right questions When you factor in recruitment and training costs, the average cost-per-hire for hourly employees is $4,129. The best way of reducing that cost? Smarter hiring. Hiring managers need to ask more questions to understand whether an applicant is a good cultural fit and likely to stick around. To help you gain a better understanding of the applicant, here are several questions you should consider asking: Availability: Which days of the week are you available to work? How many hours are you available to work each week? What shift(s) are you available to work? Are you available in the morning (8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.), afternoon (12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.), or evening (5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.)? Work history and drive: Have you previously worked in this industry? What are your current major responsibilities? Why are you leaving your current position? May we contact a work reference (at least one, with name, phone number, relation, years)? What motivates you to come into work every day? What attracted you to this company? Attendance Share an example of when you weren't able to be at work on time. How did you handle it? Tell me about a time when you weren't able to meet your work schedule requirements. How did you resolve this? Salary What is your salary expectation? Education What is the highest level of education you've completed? Are you currently enrolled? What school did (or do) you attend, for how many years and in what field of study? Job description What is your understanding of the skills necessary to perform this job? What special training have you completed that qualifies you for this role? Name one skill that makes you qualified for this position. Scenarios Have you ever disagreed with a manager or superior? How did you resolve it? Describe a time when you were in conflict with a coworker. How did you resolve the situation? Tell us about an occasion when you believe that you delighted a customer, either an internal or an external customer. -or- Tell us about a time when you had to deal with an irate customer or client. Problem solving Have you ever felt like you are not qualified for a job assigned to you? How did you handle it? How do you handle a situation when you make a mistake? Provide an example of a situation when you needed to work under a lot of pressure. How did you get through it? Give an example of a time when you were forced to improvise a solution to solve a problem. What did you learn from the experience? The average cost-per-hire for hourly workers: $4,129 Refresh your current interview questions by exploring the top questions you should (and shouldn’t) ask. Best and worst interview questions Behavioral questions As you’re interviewing, be sure you’re listening for qualities that best align with the role, team needs, and company culture. Bad-mouthing previous employers, short work experience, tardiness and being unprepared, having no references and/or the lack of shared goals can all be signs that a potential hourly worker might disrupt the current peace and productivity of your existing team and drive rock-star employees away. Bad-mouthing or negativity Bad-mouthing former team members from the start could indicate a generally negative outlook or even a lack of personal responsibility in the workplace. Ask how they’ve improved on a recent critique. Short work history One too many previous jobs over a short period of time can be a signal that the candidate has experienced a string of hardships, that they’re difficult to work with, or that they are uncommitted. Address the candidate’s short work history to understand the true why. Tardiness or disorganization Failing to prioritize the scheduling of or attendance at their interview, being unprepared, or seeming uninterested during your time together could signal that a candidate might struggle with preparedness. Communicate company preferences around timeliness. No or low-quality references A long history but no references might indicate that the candidate did not make a notable impact in their last role. It could also mean that their previous employer may not have an accurate understanding of their capabilities. Ask about the last manager that really inspired them. Unrelated goals Having goals that are not in alignment with your role’s track could be a sign that your candidate will continue to look elsewhere to fulfill those goals once hired. Present long-term milestones to gauge interest. Level up your offer (and rejection) letter After you’ve gone through the process of attracting and interviewing the candidates, you finally get to offer them the role! The offer is, hands down, one of the most exciting moments of the hiring process—for you and the candidate. No matter what the role is, an employee is still an investment in your organization, and a meaningful offer letter tells them that you’re as invested in them as you hope they will be in your company. Continue to build that excitement and show your future team members that you care by sending them a well-thought-out offer letter. Create an official template There are just three things you need to remember to include in a job offer letter to protect both you and the job candidate: the offer of the position, the details of the position, and some legal considerations. Your offer letter is another touch point that you can use to communicate both how much you value the candidate and your company culture. Feel free to infuse it with personality. Make a verbal offer first, followed by a short written letter with a space for the job candidate’s signature and the date. It benefits both of you to have a signed document detailing the offer. Here's an example. Hey [candidate name], On behalf of everyone at [company], we’re delighted to offer you the role of [job title]! As we have gotten to know you over these past few [days/weeks/months], it has become clear that your talents, goals and values are a perfect match for our team. It would be an honor to bring you on board as we work toward [describe a little bit about your company’s mission]. Your official offer letter outlining everything you need to know [is attached/ was sent in a separate email]. Please let me know if you have any trouble viewing it. As you review the offer details, we’d love to answer any questions you might have before you make your decision. We’re aiming for a start date of [date], and it would be great to hear your feedback on this offer by [date]. If this time frame doesn’t work for you, please let us know. So the real question is… can we order your [name tag/team jacket] yet? :) Cheers, [your name] Offer The offer letter should be written in an exciting tone and convey the message that the candidate should be proud to have made it to this final level in the process. Detail Hourly rate Pay schedule Exact take-home pay Exempt status Legal Not a contract At-will employment Contingencies Want a deeper dive into offer letters? Often overlooked, but just as important as extending an offer, is how you tell someone they didn’t get the job. After all, this impacts your business’s reputation—and bad word of mouth can work against you as you continue to source candidates in the future. It also serves as a great opportunity for you to maintain your relationship should the candidate be better suited for a role you post in the future or if your preferred candidate doesn't accept the job. There are several reasons why you may choose not to move forward with a candidate. To help you, we’ve put together several templates: How to Write a Job Offer Letter for Restaurant Workers How to Tell Someone They Didn't Get the Job Build a foundation for employee success through onboarding Did you know that 69% of employees are more likely to stay with a company for three years if they experienced great onboarding ? Onboarding serves as your employee’s foundation for success. A poor onboarding experience will impact the team member’s ability to perform well—not because of their lack of skills, but rather because of their lack of knowledge of your business. Give thought to what your new hires will need to know to do their job, and get everything ready before they start. Showing them that you’ve planned ahead and had everything ready will give them a sense of belonging. Share and collect paperwork Legal documents: They may not be the most exciting part of the hiring process, but they are one of the most important. How you gather the forms is ultimately up to you. You can print them or share electronic copies. Either way, be sure you collect the information before the new employee starts. Here are the top forms you’ll need. Each is linked to its respective federal website for easy downloading. W4 Form The Employee's Witholding Allowance Certificate is filled out to ensure that the employers withhold the correct federal income tax from employee's pay. W9 Form The Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification is used when a business hires an employee as a contractor. W2 Form Form W2 is used to report wages paid to employees and the taxes withheld from them. I-9 Employment Eligibility Form The I-9 form is used to verify the identity and employment authorization for individuals hired to work in the U.S. Direct Deposit Form A direct deposit form authorizes a third party, usually any employer, to directly send money or funds to an employee's bank account. DL 1-65 Form The DL 1-65 Form is filled out with emergency contact information for the employee. Form 8850 The Pre-Screening Notice and Certification Request for the Work Opportunity Credit is filled out when hiring individuals from certain targeted groups who have consistently faced barriers when seeking employment. Equal Opportunity Data Form Employees can self-identify their race, ethnicity, veteran status or disabilities in the equal opportunity survey. Employees can decline to answer these questions. Welcome your new hire Day one for your new hire is another critical moment when you can show them you value them and are invested in their success. Here are some simple and effective ways to get them integrated into—and seeing themselves as part of—the team. Greet employees at reception The first day of work sets the tone for the days ahead. Make sure it goes smoothly for your new hire by ensuring they see a friendly face when they first arrive. Collect paperwork Collect all new hire paperwork. If needed, help your new employee review and sign all the HR administrative paperwork. Introduce your new employee to coworkers This is incredibly important, as it will foster healthy working relationships with your team. Use an icebreaker game if you’re onboarding multiple people in the same week. For example, you could have each person share a fun fact about themselves. Accompany employees to their workstations Make sure your new team member is comfortable and that all equipment is in proper working condition. Direct them to technical support should they have questions on day one or any day in the future. Give a tour of the department Show the common areas, such as the lunchroom, bathrooms, employee parking, etc. It’s important for your new hire to know the lay of the land. \"Workstream keeps us streamlined. All the way from using an app to screening an applicant to paperwork where we can get it done overnight and hire an employee.” Rachel Heus | HR Director of Chick-fil-A + Lehi Pointe Jump into orientation As you onboard your new hires, give them all the tools and guidance they’ll need to understand your business, follow company policies, and be successful. Listed below are a few resources you should consider sharing and a few topics to cover during your conversations. Introduce business fundamentals Introduce the company mission, values, and leadership. Inspire your new employees and make them feel welcome. Provide an employee handbook Give the new hire a copy of the company’s handbook and/or any artifacts that outline rules and regulations, company culture, etc. Explain and review key policies Review the major policies in your handbook, even if you share a copy for them to read on their own. Define job responsibilities Review the new hire’s core function, share how their work will be reviewed, and give them an opportunity to ask questions. Having a shared understanding from the beginning will be mutually beneficial. Introduce benefits plans and perks Share details about benefits and perks (i.e., bonuses, insurance options, paid leave, etc.), and give your new employee a chance to ask questions. Provide training and mentoring Schedule a training session with a senior employee to teach them the ropes and develop a mentor relationship. Give a physical tour of the workplace Guide the new hires through nearby facilities and identify areas where they are allowed to go and what areas to avoid. Get feedback Ask your employees to ask questions once they’ve completed the process and again a few days later. Retain your employees by investing in the right things Retaining hourly workers is one of the biggest challenges you regularly face, and the impact of that churn costs you time and money. In addition to creating an amazing hiring and onboarding experience, it’s important for you to continue to invest in the ongoing employee experience. There are several things you can do to keep your employees engaged and feeling valued. Build a culture of respect Showing your hourly workers (and all your other employees, really) that you care about and respect them is key to retaining them. Two-thirds of employees say they would likely leave their jobs if they didn't feel appreciated . For millennials, the number jumps to 76%. This is why you need to create an enjoyable work environment where all of your employees feel like a team. Show them that you appreciate all their hard work and that you're truly thrilled to have them around. A simple \"thank you\" can really go a long way. However, you should also provide your team members with more tangible benefits, as kind words don't pay bills. Offer compelling incentives Every successful company offers its employees enticing incentives that motivate them to push harder and to go above and beyond to achieve the company's goals. Those incentives often include various benefits , such as health, life, dental insurance, retirement plans, paid time off, vacation, a flexible work schedule, and many other benefits. While these are all very important, most employees appreciate monetary benefits the most. Giving top performers a bonus or a raise is the best way to motivate them to keep working hard. It shows that you recognize their efforts and that you truly appreciate everything they do. Apart from the benefits mentioned above, you can provide profit-sharing bonuses, vacations for top performers, and gym memberships. You can also organize annual contests and enable your workers to receive great prizes, like cash, TVs, or other valuable items. Whatever incentives you choose to offer your hourly workers, the key is to give them something that encourages them to stay. After all, if you don't value their work or compensate them properly for their efforts, they'll have no problem finding someone else who will. 5 tips for keeping top performers: Develop strong onboarding by coaching HR and recruiting to work together on a consistent narrative. Provide clear and easy opportunities for training and advancement. Create an enjoyable work environment, where all your employees can feel like a team. Recognize and motivate high performers with monetary incentives. Adopt and promote accessible internal communications tools and strategies to keep everyone aligned. Provide learning and development opportunities Your employees want their job to be a stepping stone in their career. They want to know that they’re progressing professionally and moving towards more meaningful job opportunities. Why not let them progress with you? Some employers fear that investing in employee professional development prepares the employee to leave the company for another job. Perhaps it does prepare them for more advanced jobs. But, those jobs could be within your company. According to a new study conducted by Bridge, 86% of millennials say that offering career training and development keeps them from leaving their current position. The big takeaway? Don't let your hourly workers see their job as a temporary solution before they move to where they actually want to be. Show them that there are plenty of future growth opportunities at your company and help them build strong careers. Provide training courses and career mentorship s, and help them learn and grow professionally every step of the way.

Today, I’m excited to share that we’re increasing that commitment by introducing you to an exciting new chapter. As of today, Workstream is a complete all-in-one HR, hiring, and payroll platform that’s designed to make your job easier. And I can’t wait to show you how. What’s new We recently conducted a survey to discover the biggest challenges in running hourly payroll. At the top of the list was reviewing timesheets and hours worked—these tasks were the most time-consuming tasks that business owners identified. So we set out to solve these problems and other associated challenges: managing overtime, breaks, tipping, compliance, labor laws, this list goes on and on. Our new Time Clock and Shift Scheduling addresses some of the biggest challenges in managing an hourly workforce, and running payroll specifically. Importantly, these new tools don’t just work alongside our payroll solution—they fully integrate with it, creating a unified experience that reduces administrative overhead and minimizes mistakes. Time Clock Our digital Time Clock makes tracking hours simple and accurate. Workers' hours are logged in real-time and instantly synced with Payroll. Potential issues with clock-ins and clock-outs are automatically flagged for you to review, so you can catch errors before they become big problems. This eliminates the need for manual timecard entries, reduces the risk of errors, and ensures you’re only paying for hours actually worked. Why it matters to you Accurate time tracking is essential for payroll and compliance. By integrating it directly into our platform, you’ll save time and avoid costly mistakes. Shift Scheduling Managing and distributing shift schedules can be a huge source of headaches, but not anymore. With our new Shift Scheduling tool, you can create, adjust, and share schedules with just a few clicks. Employees can access their shifts, swap them, and get updates—all in one place. And because scheduling is integrated with time tracking and payroll, everything flows together smoothly. Why it matters to you Scheduling efficiency directly impacts your bottom line and employee satisfaction. Our seamless integration ensures that when schedules change, payroll and time tracking adjust automatically, keeping your operations running smoothly. Workstream Payroll, better than ever We built Payroll to be as seamless and error-free as possible. By integrating real-time data from our Time Clock and Shift Scheduling, payroll calculations are done automatically, with less manual input required. This means no more scrambling to correct timesheet errors or worrying about compliance issues. And with automatic tax filings, you’ll stay on top of regulations without lifting a finger. Looking forward For years, we’ve seen businesses struggle with the complexities of managing and paying hourly employees. That’s why we’re so excited about this next chapter of Workstream. Our vision has always been to create technology that not only simplifies work but empowers business owners to manage their hourly teams more effectively. With Payroll tightly integrated into our all-in-one platform , you’ll no longer be bogged down by administrative tasks that pull your attention away from what truly matters: your customers and your people.

You’ve committed to working potentially 90+ hours a week, running a team of hourly workers, and establishing a new place that serves a local community that you want to give back to. Congratulations, you’re now running a Quick-Service Restaurant (QSR) franchise business. Or maybe, not quite yet. Let’s wait to uncork that champagne in case you’re just in the planning stages. Maybe you’ve heard from other franchisees how wonderful it is to be your own boss, yet have the help and support of a large corporation being the wind in your sails. Maybe you’ve seen various franchises around your area, Domino’s, Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s, Subway, or Carl’s Jr., outlast other small businesses, and even expand into new, nearby locations. In 2019, there were close to 800,000 franchise establishments and operators in America , which had been on an upward trend for years, so you’re not wrong: franchises are thriving. But what does it take to succeed as a QSR franchisee and entrepreneur? Is opening a franchise as turn-key as you think it is? What exactly goes into running a franchise location, not just to barely survive but to thrive and be profitable? Over the years, I have sat down with dozens of QSR franchise owners and have learned the tips and tricks from some of the best operators in the country. I’ve spoken with franchisees who own hundreds of QSR locations, as well as those who own just two or three highly profitable stores. I’ve put together this ultimate guide to be a one-stop-shop to understanding what it takes to succeed in QSR franchising, summing up years of research and conversations with the top QSR franchisees in America. The aim of this guide is to help those who are serious about embarking on their own QSR franchise journey crystalize what they will have to do, and the considerations that they will have to make, to become a success in this industry. Negotiate a great lease for your location Finding a great location for a QSR is key to success, and so is negotiating the lease so it works in your favor. Signing a badly negotiated lease can make it nearly impossible to keep your business afloat. Let’s discuss some strategies to put your new business in an advantageous position. Location, location, location One of the most important pillars of a successful QSR comes long before spending a single dollar: where your restaurant will go. As you carefully select the location of your QSR, there are a few factors to keep in mind. Does the location you have in mind have great foot traffic? Don’t guess on this important factor. You should physically survey the spot and measure just how much foot traffic the area gets. How about on weekdays? Or weekends? What time of day does foot traffic peak? Ask surrounding businesses what their experience has been over the last year or two. Have they seen foot traffic increase or decrease during this time? Does this location serve people looking for a quick lunch during office rush hours, or families out with their children? Depending on your specific franchise brand, you’ll want to target more of one group than another. Are you looking to serve as a grab-and-go hub, or more of a sit-down location? Understanding the type of people in your chosen area can help you either formulate a plan of attack, or quickly make you decide to choose another location. Does your location do seasonal business? QSRs near schools understand that there is a huge difference in traffic between the fall and summer seasons. Or if you are in a part of the country where winters are cold, how will your smoothie shack perform when it’s below freezing? Can the summer traffic cover your costs during leaner winter months? Does this location have easy access to public transportation? What is the parking situation like? What will the drive-thru situation look like if there is a long line of cars? The easier the area is to get to, the better the business will do. Research whether there are any plans to bring a train or bus stop to the area. This is often a good sign of a good investment for future growth. Find a great real estate agent Sometimes, the franchise corporate team can help connect you with a real estate agent that can help you make the right decisions. Otherwise, asking for referrals from other QSR operators in your area or within your brand can be a good source for finding a trustworthy agent. Get the right leasing terms for you There are many factors that contribute to signing a commercial lease. How many years are you planning to sign for? Are you signing a lease during a recession or when the economy is booming? Is the area you want a brand new shopping mall or at a property that has been around for decades? Generally, if you are confident in your chosen location, it makes sense to sign for a longer period of time as it will often help you get better pricing. Likewise, signing during a recession can help you get better deals. Raise capital and funding Now that you’ve chosen the location for your QSR, it’s time to gather the funds to establish your business. Raising capital is a constant area of concern for prospective entrepreneurs and I hear from franchisees that there is a surprising lack of information on this topic online. So let’s dive into the top places to secure funding to finance your QSR. Your personal network Often, the entrepreneur’s own savings is the main source of seed money to start their QSR business. This obviously comes with a huge risk of potentially losing your savings in a bad business venture. So how can one mitigate the cost and risk a bit more? Loop in your personal network into your business. Be it friends or family, raising a small round of capital from people you personally know is a solid way to start gathering funds. If it was good enough for Jeff Bezos who got his parents to chip in to his strange “Amazon” idea , it might work for you too. Maybe don’t promise that you’ll be the next Amazon, but rather that you have a great plan in place to run a successful QSR location. No matter who invests from your personal network, write down an agreement defining the terms and details of their investment and what repayment will look like. Your friends and family may trust you inherently, but it’s necessary to get everything in writing so everyone has a reference to the terms. Angel investors If you can pitch your business proposal to private investors, often referred to as angel investors, you might be able to raise your initial seed money very quickly. A popular approach especially in Silicon Valley, is to connect with angel investors via platforms such as Angelist, Republic, and you can also connect with them on LinkedIn, local networking groups, and at conferences. I have personally raised capital from angel investors several times, and I find that the best way to do so is to build long-term relationships with mentors and advisors that you trust. These relationships may be for many months or several years, because at the end of they day, they are investing into you more than they are the business. Earning their trust is everything. Institutional funds/Private equity funds A popular financial option for franchisees are institutional funds focused on the QSR industry: The Kitchen Fund, Joe Montana’s Liquid 2 Ventures, FransMart, Rock Capital, FOCUS Group, Apollo Group, and more. Typically, these private equity funds tend to invest at a point when there is already some traction. For example, they're interested when you have been able to prove your growth to at least 2-5 locations in your business. They want to know that you have experience and a proven track record before they invest in you. Crowdfunding These days, many entrepreneurs have used platforms like Indiegogo and Kickstarter to raise capital for their business venture. They can even go viral on social media to spur interest from the community. Of course, it helps if you have a great story behind why you want to launch a business in a particular location. If a large part of your QSR goal is to contribute to a specific town or area, this can be a great opportunity to tell your unique story and gain interest from locals who want to invest into their own neighborhood. Craft a video telling your vision and story and publish it to your online networks. Even small contributions can quickly add up as your crowdfunding page is shared. Build a great team and culture Building a great team and culture is the number one priority for any QSR franchise operator. From preparing the food, to maintaining the location, to customer interactions, and everything else in between; your team is the lifeblood of your business. The average franchise location can have anywhere from 10 employees (think Subway, for example) to over 80 (think Chick-fil-A). No matter the number, it’s not a simple matter managing a team, and it’s even harder when they may be far away in multiple locations across town. This is why it’s so important to hire great people, train them up well, and treat them with respect. Building a great team and establishing a solid culture starts from the top. Clearly lay out the culture & values of your business It is crucial for a QSR operator to lay out the culture and values for your business, or even for your location. From conversations with the top QSR operators, I have learned that they clearly define the values that motivate them internally, beyond a pure bottom line point of view. They want to empower the community, give back to people, and become a driving force in providing high-quality food to their customers in an efficient way. It is important for a QSR operator to actually write down the culture and values and to share it often with your employees. Make it shareable and easily accessible, and include it as part of the onboarding process for new hires. Here is a sample of Workstream’s company values: Humble and hungry: Be scrappy. Focus on getting things done. We measure by things done and less by facetime. Stay humble, stay hungry. Everyone does customer success: We are obsessed with customer success. We work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust and make them succeed in their work. Don’t lose the human touch: We are solving an important problem and believe in teamwork and putting people first. We focus on helping others, and are fanatical about keeping the human connection. We are the people. Direct feedback is a gift: Feedback helps us to improve and move forward. We believe in honesty, transparency, and helping each other to improve and become better. As Brian Chesky, co-founder and CEO of AirBnb famously said “Don’t fuck up the culture. Culture is simply a shared way of doing something with passion. Our culture is the foundation for our company.” Hire the best talent The average employee churn at QSR locations can be up to 150% annually . Many operators have to hire a new person every week for a single location. At this turnover rate, you may think it would be easier to hire whoever you can, no matter their skill or aptitude. Some QSR owners have even propagated the idea that who you hire doesn’t really matter. This couldn’t be further from the truth. It’s crucial to hire great talent, not only to mitigate churn, but to grow the business as well. Great hourly workers become great managers, and that’s the path to expanding or even running another franchise location. Invest in the right resources to hire well , provide proper training, and reap the benefits of good workers who help you accomplish more than you ever thought you could. Create an environment of teamwork and open feedback Running a quick-service restaurant is a team sport. It’s not possible for a single employee or operator to run a Chick-fil-A or Pieology location, and it is crucial for you as the franchise owner to understand it yourself (too many owners try to do it all on their own). You need to foster a s trong team culture of placing the team before yourself and working towards a common shared goal: running a successful QSR franchise. I am a huge fan of Netflix’s Culture Deck , which outlines their philosophy and methods to creating a strong culture for your team. One of the key points that leads to great teamwork is feedback on actions. Not all feedback is created equal. You can overly sugarcoat feedback, making it too subtle for any point to be made. At the same time, you don’t want to make it a personal attack. That always causes employees to become defensive and resistant. Therefore, the feedback should always be about the action, not the person. A great treatise on creating a teamwork-based culture is one by Bill Walsh, the former coach of San Francisco 49ers, called “The Score Takes Care of Itself”. Bill took a group of players who were struggling to solidify into an actual team and transformed them in a couple of seasons from being last in the league to champions. Coaches used to rely on screaming and shouting, and Bill created Standards of Performance (SOPs) for everything from answering the phone to training top players. The SOPs were lists of how to do certain things so everyone on Bill’s team was consistent. They include: Be positive. Spend more time telling people what to do rather than what not to do. Don’t address negative issues just to vent Be prepared Be detail oriented but don’t bury yourself in details Be accountable Be near sighted and far sighted Be fare. Ethically sound values are important. Be clear about what you stand for, then stand up for it Don’t budge from your values, standards, principals Consistency is important but you must also be quick to adapt to changing circumstances Believe in yourself Be a leader Being a former professional basketball athlete myself, I could relate to and identify many of the similar values and pointers of how running a quick-service restaurant is similar to building and leading a sports team. Align closely with your franchise corporate partners Each QSR brand, from Jamba Juice to Burger King, has their own unique initiatives and corporate structure. As a QSR operator, you’ll need to work closely with corporate HQ to align with their vision and brand direction. While some may consider this to be stifling, most understand that working with the franchise team is the best way to be trained and onboarded property, setting yourself up for the best chance of success. Understand the roles of each corporate partner and team lead In most QSR corporate teams, there will be a mix of key players that you will be in contact with as you start your business. Understanding who these leads are and what they do, and can do for you, will help you navigate your first few steps. VP of Franchise Development: This lead works with new franchise owners to educate them on brand matters. They can work with prospective franchise owners to see if the brand is a right fit for them. VP of Marketing: This lead works closely with QSR owners to help them market not just the franchise brand, but to market their specific new location in the community. VP of Human Resources: This lead works with QSR owners in the sourcing, hiring, and onboarding of employees for each location. They can also help new owners understand what their responsibilities are in managing a team, from payroll to benefits. Be trained and onboarded as a franchisee Typically, during your first three months after signing on as a franchisee, you will be asked to spend one to three weeks at one of the franchise’s corporate locations to train with these team leads. While there will be literature to read and observations to make, the best training will be actual work on the floor of locations in operation. Be prepared to get your hands dirty as you cook food, serve customers, and really get to know how the business works on a daily basis. It’s crucial to use this time to ask as many questions as you can about the process of running your own store, as you’ll not only have access to the team leads, but the owners of successful locations. Establishing good relationships at this stage can help you build allies for the future, so be attentive and as friendly as you can! Keep open communications with corporate Nothing stays the same forever, even brands that have been around for decades. As the franchise evolves, the corporate team will provide updates to vision and procedure via emails, quarterly calls, and meet-ups. You’ll also have access to internal resources and guides that are updated regularly as well. Read as much as you can. Pay attention to updates and highlights. They want your franchise to succeed and gleaning tips from other successful locations, adopting the newest menu items quickly, or utilizing corporate’s new assistance initiatives (ie. marketing blitzes) can help your store perform better. Corporate also appreciates your feedback and honest communication, so don’t hesitate to ask questions or for assistance. Build a great hiring and onboarding process at your location Putting together a talented, well-trained team is one of the most important things you can do as a franchisee to set yourself up for success. Every hourly worker is a touch point between your business and your customer, which will define the experience your guests have when they come into your location. Poor employees mean poor customer experiences, and your business will be over before it really even starts. So put in the time and effort to source the right talent and train them up properly. Going further, you’ll want to establish an efficient process for hiring that will provide you with the talent pipeline you’ll need as you scale. Remember, hiring for QSR is a never-ending task. With turnover rates as high as 150% each year, your process can’t be ad hoc; rather, the successful franchisee will develop a strategy to keep that hiring pipeline full and flowing. Have an efficient way to source the best talent. We are in modern times with modern solutions for many hiring bottlenecks. Especially in the QSR industry, speed wins . Take too long to hire for your positions, and your candidates will go elsewhere. Leverage the wide range of resources you have at your disposal: Utilize text-to-apply posters in your local area so people in your community can easily apply for open positions. Make your job application mobile-friendly so people can apply directly from their phones. Create referral programs so your current employees can help you source from their pool of contacts. Invest in hiring automation software like Workstream to post to hundreds of job sites at once. Screen and engage with applicants via text messaging, video, and quizzes Depending on your location, applicants may have many options when looking for hourly work. To stay competitive with other local businesses, be speedy with your responses in order to keep the candidate’s interest. Text messaging has a 95% open rate compared to email, which only has a 25% open rate. You’re also 3x more likely to get a response using texts than email. Hence, modern hiring leans toward SMS when engaging with candidates, especially if they are younger. Millennials and Gen-Z have largely grown up with smartphones and texting, and are more comfortable engaging on that platform. A modern way to screen candidates faster is to use smart screening questions on the initial application that can help you easily sort by the most qualified candidates. Questions like: Do you have a license? Can you lift 25lb? Do you have restaurant experience? How many years? If your hiring platform can capture the responses from these quizzes, you’ll be able to sift through hundreds of resumes much faster without accidentally skipping a great candidate. Most recently, businesses have been screening candidates by asking them to upload short videos that helps hiring managers gauge their personalities. Carl’s Jr. asks candidates to record a 30 second video answering “Why do you want to work for Carl’s Jr. and this specific position?” to see how the applicant communicates and how they present their thoughts. It’s been a great way to pre-screen candidates before the one-on-one interview and makes sure the pipeline is full of great candidates. Onboard your employees correctly Hiring isn’t enough to ensure the candidate becomes a good employee. Proper training in the first few weeks is crucial in shaping them to be successful at your location. A well-designed onboarding process is key to this process. Great onboarding involves: Online documentation that lays out the fundamentals of the brand and the role, accessible by each employee Engaged training and orientation videos Supervised hands-on training The employee's main take-away should be the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) they'll need to excel. Leverage technology to improve efficiency As a former QSR manager, I used to pride myself on efficiency by using a mix of paper, books, pens, and emails. As a fairly organized person, I was able to run my business decently, but looking back, I realize I should have utilized much more of the technology I had available to me to find real efficiency. Almost a year into running that business, I became much more open to trying out new software and realized much too late how much time and energy I could have been saving. Perhaps I was too cost-conscious at the time, not understanding how much time actually costs busy owners of a QSR. These days, there are a host of affordable tech available for managers that can boost efficiency. Ranging from hiring and onboarding tools, POS solutions, CRM platforms, and more; it’s worth taking some time to test out and evaluate these options to see what might work best for your business. Here’s how to go about finding the right technology for your location: Talk to your team to understand their current time-challenges Stay connected to your team as they are the eyes and ears of the business and will usually know what issues are the biggest problems that take up the most time in their day. Either as a team or in 1-on-1 meetings, find out the pain points in their daily, weekly, and monthly tasks. It’s important to iterate that their job is safe and that you’re not trying to replace them. Rather, you are a team trying to figure out how to make the work easier and faster for everyone involved. Some QSR owners conduct a team-wide survey every so often, keeping it anonymous, to get feedback on the challenges they face. This way they are more free to communicate candidly about different issues. However you do it, distill the common problems and try to rank them by how much time each of them costs your team. Conduct market research on the best solutions Now that you have a good idea on the main problems to tackle, find the tools that can help. One of the best ways to do this is to utilize your QSR network. There’s rarely anything new under the sun when it comes to managing a QSR; meaning, your franchisee peers may have already tackled your issue. See what software or technology they use and evaluate their opinions on the pros and cons. If it worked for one location, there’s a good chance it’ll work for yours. Reach out to your corporate contacts and see what tools they may recommend. Franchise groups may have agreements with companies that offer solutions at a bulk discount. Even if they don’t, having the clout of the brand behind your request can get you discounts on a solution you’ve found or that corporate suggests. On the flip side of what I wrote above, if you’re having a specific efficiency problem then there’s a good chance others are having it as well. Check out software review sites for solutions that may solve your team’s bottleneck to see how others have rated the technology. Usually there is a free trial for a few days or weeks to evaluate the product. Use this time! Thoroughly vet the software during the free trial to see how it may work with your team. Pro tip: if you contact the company, often they will extend the free trial for you to get a better sense of its use cases. Designate a point of contact to test the product It’s best to designate a lead on your team to test the solution. For example, if you are testing out Workstream, get your hiring manager or COO to thoroughly use the product to make sure that it can work for them. It’s often hard for you, the CEO, to make time to test all the details of a product. Unless you’ll be using the software directly each day, assign this task to the team member who will be using it the most. If I could do it all over again, I wouldn’t be as reluctant to use technology to help by restaurant business. Now that I am on the other side of this equation building the right software for busy owners to use, I know that the cost of the software itself almost always pales in comparison to the time savings for you and your team, let alone the increased business due to better efficiency. Upgrade the skillset of your employees The best way to get the best talent on your team is to train your current team. By keeping them engaged and motivated, you can help them learn more in their role and get more out of them. Due to the high turnover rate of the QSR industry, it’s a convenient myth to think there is no point in training employees any more than you have to since they’ll just leave in a few weeks or months. The reality is that one of the main reasons they leave is they don’t feel like there is any room for improvement and growth! Most workers want more training. They want to learn new skills. Teaching them won’t chase them away; it will in fact make them more loyal . In my experience, I’ve even found that training employees well also encourages them to return to be reemployed at your store. I’ve worked with young adults who left for school, but came back every summer and winter break to work because they appreciated the training I was able to provide. So, how can you continue to grow the skillsets of your hourly workers? Enact a structured training strategy the moment they onboard We already touched on the initial training phase that lasts for a few weeks to a month, but training should never end there. After the initial “basic training,” there should be advanced sessions designed to specifically target skillsets or higher-level positions. Training shift workers to become shift leaders is the most straightforward goal to base strategies around. What does the average shift worker need to learn to be able to become a shift leader? How long will they need? Perhaps there is a 3-month long training process that includes on-the-job training that will get an employee to this goal. A more lateral training opportunity would be to instill new skills such as cooking specific items, operating the drive-thru, dealing with customer service, etc. Target skills that will help them expand their resume. Learning new software and equipment will do that, as well as exposure to more customer-facing roles. Again, have a strategy in place that includes the time allotted to master these new skills. An hourly worker can learn a new skill a month, for example, and quickly expand their usefulness to your location and to their future prospects. Utilize online training tools and resources Coming up with an ongoing training plan may be difficult for new entrepreneurs. Luckily there are online tools and resources that can help you enact these training programs at your QSR location. Massively Open Online Courses (MOOC) are great for self-motivated individuals. Coursera and MITOpenCourseWare are two examples. They have courses and training for skills such as Customer Service, Operations, Marketing, and more. Subscriptions can be a business expense and a worthwhile investment to improve your entire team. Of course, your employees have to feel some sense of self-motivation to do these courses, but you can also incentivize them to learn with bonuses for completing coursework. Great leaders inspire their team in many different ways. And keep in mind that empowering your team and keeping them engaged will only make your business that much better. Happy employees are more productive and can lead to overall growth for your location. Create a partner-system to encourage teamwork and learning Having a “buddy system” worked well for my own team. I would often pair up a more experienced employee with someone who just started to create a casual mentorship partner system . This always seems to help both sides: the newer employee gets up-to-speed faster, and the seasoned employee learns leadership and accountability skills. Having them work on specific tasks together during the week, often tasks that are new to them, can help this partnership grow. Two heads really are better than one when it comes to training and motivation. Having a partner tackling new challenges with you is something most workers appreciate. Join local franchise groups and communities Being a part of a franchise group means having other owners and operators in the QSR industry to learn from, trade ideas with, and help each other grow. When I was a restaurant owner, I found it invaluable to learn from others who had gone before me. I found that entrepreneurs especially liked to connect with other owners and were willing to help and provide support, because they also had this sort of help as they were coming up. Volunteer to be part of the franchise advisory council Most QSR brands have a franchise advisory council (FAC) that helps owners learn, connect, and grow. They meet once every few months, often in person over a meal, and discuss common challenges franchisees are seeing and how they can overcome them together. Sometimes, you may have to be invited to join an FAC. It’s worth the wait and persistence because these groups are a great resource. As you make your place in your local QSR community, you will befriend FAC members and find your way in soon enough. Attend franchise conferences and local trade shows Most franchise brands have an annual conference, and some bigger brands may have several regional meetups during the year. These are great opportunities for franchise owners to get together and trade what they have learned. Like the FAC, it’s a great way to learn from other franchisees in the space. These conferences have lectures on best practices, product showcases, new suppliers, and a host of other things that can help your franchise business grow. Perhaps there’s a new POS that can cut your management time in half, or a new hiring platform to try out. Most likely, as a franchisee, you’ll get a discount to attend these conferences so do take advantage of them when they come around. Other than brand-specific conferences, there are local and regional trade shows from the National Restaurant Conference, International Franchise Association, and a few others. Read up on what they might have to offer and choose the ones to attend that fit your franchisee the best. Join online franchise communities Franchise groups for your brand probably already exist on Facebook or LinkedIn, but if they don’t then consider starting one yourself. Online communities are a great way to quickly ask questions to your peers and get feedback readily. It’s also a great way to keep abreast of the latest news and events affecting your business. Be a mentor to other franchise owners Finally, just because you’re starting out doesn’t mean you don’t have valuable insights to offer. As a newer owner in the space, perhaps you bring with you new operational methods or technologies that others might benefit from. The more you share your own goals and successes and failures, other franchise owners will do the same and open up to you as well. The QSR space can be a very supportive one with a free exchange of ideas, so take advantage of it with a good mix of give and take. Leverage PR, media, and news to your advantage A successful QSR location is one that people know about and appreciate. As you’re starting out, it’s highly beneficial to engage with local media and even some national outlets specific to the space. There are a ton of journalists that cover the industry and you’ve probably read articles about QSR in Franchise Times, QSR Magazine, Entrepreneur.com, and more. But how do you get journalists to pay attention to you specifically? I have been fortunate to be featured on ABC News, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal, TechCrunch, Business Insider, and more. Here are the strategies that have worked for me in getting my message out across various media outlets. Have a strong personal story Behind every entrepreneur is a great story. Jeff Bezos talks about being born to a teenage mother and an immigrant father. Their early family struggles inspired him to empower small businesses. More close to home, a partner of mine, Daljit Hundal, came to America when he was 18. He started as a dishwasher, but worked tirelessly to improve his situation. Today he owns over 50 franchise stores including Pieology, Jamba, and Carl’s Jr. His determination and pure grit set him apart from the rest in becoming a successful entrepreneur. I’m always inspired by his story and the story of so many other QSR operators, and these are the stories that can endear you to both the public and the press. What is your personal story? Learning to tell it correctly can give you a leg up when pitching yourself and your business to news outlets looking to tell these stories. Network with local journalists Local journalists always want to cover stories of budding entrepreneurs. Read your local publications both in print and online to see who covers these types of stories (usually in the Business section) and seek them out online via LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, or the work email they list. While you can just pitch your story, it is even better to have written an article about the business aspects of your local community. As a new entrepreneur, you may have an insightful take on what it means to bring a new store to your town. Consider publishing this to your own blog or social platforms and sharing the link with the journalist. If they can see that you have an interesting POV to share, they’ll be more inclined to engage with you to craft a piece for their publication. Don’t be shy. Journalists welcome news ideas since they’re on the content treadmill. Reach out with your personal story or how your business impacts the community and see what feedback they give. Write well-crafted emails When you reach out to journalists or online outlets, the best way to get their attention is to write well-crafted emails as your pitch. Start with a good subject line or title to your email that will grab their attention. For example, if you are a local QSR franchise owner in Palo Alto, a good title may be something like “Palo Alto entrepreneur opens new restaurant to serve the community with meals and jobs.” Especially during this time, that can pique the interest of your target local journalist. In the body of your email, highlight what your intent is and why you are writing in. Are you looking for advice on how to get your story published? Are you trying to get the journalist to directly publish your article? Did you want to chat with the journalist over the phone or via a video meeting? Remember to stay friendly and to always pitch your personal story as well. Leverage the brand of your franchise as that can sway interest. After all, if you’re opening a new McDonald’s location, that can be newsworthy in and of itself. HARO: Help a Reporter Out Help a Reporter Out (HARO) is a news marketplace that connects reporters and news stories. There are hundreds of reporters browsing it each day, stating the types of stories they are looking for. You’ll need to sign up, but once you do, it’s a simple way to find someone who may be looking for your exact story. Give back to the community A QSR’s purpose isn’t just to make you money, but also to serve a local community. Great businesses lift the other businesses and individuals around it, and we count on these businesses to contribute to the community for the lifetime of their existence. Codifying the idea of giving back to your community is an important part of running a successful business. Engaging with the neighborhood you serve by helping a nearby school, or providing free catering for local events, is an empowering action for you and your team. After all, we all need a sense of purpose to drive us. Build morale, team culture, and camaraderie QSRs are high stress due to the fast pace and non-stop nature of the business. Having your team do a community project together provides a reason to finally breathe a little and connect in an entirely different way. Taking on a community project is different from the norm, and can dismantle artificial hierarchies that might stiffen team bonding. You as the owner should lead by example, getting “down and dirty” with your team to do everything together. Working toward an altruistic goal helps develop a team culture quickly. Often, hourly workers get lost in the day-to-day of the job. Unlike management, they might not see how they truly service the community at large. In other cases, you and other higher-level managers may have lost sight of the neighborhood and your hourly workers can help you reconnect with the people you’re serving. Ideas and projects to help your community: Give out free meals at your location Sponsor a crowdfunding campaign for local projects Volunteer as a team to work on a construction project Run a cooking class for the community Visit a nursing home or hospital with hot meals Start a cooking webinar series for students featuring your team Deliver meals directly to needy families around town I have always been a huge fan of giving back to the community, and I feel it’s the duty of any growing business to do so. You take care of your community, and they’ll take care of you. Hopefully, it’s a win-win process for everyone involved, especially since your location may attract some press and more public awareness. But the imperative is beyond that scope and an important moral goal of your new QSR store.

The challenges are many, and the administrative load can quickly become overwhelming. From hiring new hourly workers to onboarding them and managing their benefits, the day-to-day operations of handling hourly workers can lead to significant admin burnout. But it doesn’t have to be this way. By streamlining your processes and embracing smart solutions, you can lighten the load and create a more efficient, less stressful environment for both you and your team. Hiring made simple: Focus on quality over quantity The first step in reducing admin burnout is rethinking your hiring process. Instead of casting a wide net and sifting through countless applications for hourly workers, focus on sourcing quality candidates who are the right fit from the start. The key to attracting great hourly workers starts with a strong job description. By clearly outlining the expectations, roles, and responsibilities your hourly workers will handle, you can bring in ready and eager candidates to join your team. This transparency not only attracts candidates who are genuinely interested in and qualified for the position but also reduces turnover down the line. Don’t forget to highlight the competitive pay and benefits your business offers. Whether it’s flexible scheduling, healthcare options, or opportunities for advancement, showcasing these perks can help you stand out from the competition and draw in top-tier talent who are looking for more than just a paycheck. Beyond optmizing your job descriptions to attract the right new applicants, you can also tap into talent pools who are already familiar with your business—like former hourly employees or past applicants. These candidates are not only likely to require less training, but they also have a better understanding of your brand and operations. Automating parts of the hiring process can also save you time and energy. For example, using pre-screening tools and setting up automated interview scheduling can reduce the back-and-forth emails that eat up valuable time. The goal is to simplify and streamline, so you can focus on finding the best people for your team without the administrative headache. Onboarding with ease: Set the stage for success Onboarding is where you lay the foundation for a successful employment relationship, but it can also be a major source of stress if not handled efficiently. A well-structured onboarding process not only helps new hires feel welcome but also gets them up to speed faster, reducing the likelihood of early turnover. Consider creating a digital onboarding experience for your hourly workers that allows new hires to complete paperwork, review company policies, and even start training before their first day. This reduces the time spent on in-person orientation and ensures that your new houry workers hit the ground running. Plus, with everything stored digitally, you can easily track progress and ensure nothing falls through the cracks. Streamlining benefits management: Keep it simple and accessible Managing employee benefits, especially for hourly workers, is another area where franchise owners can feel the strain. Between ensuring compliance, communicating options, and handling enrollment, it’s easy to see how this aspect of HR can become overwhelming. The key here is simplicity. Offering a straightforward benefits package that meets the needs of your hourly workers can reduce confusion and administrative work. Additionally, using an integrated benefits management system can help you track enrollments, changes, and compliance in one place, freeing you from the stress of juggling multiple platforms or paper records. What broker you choose to partner with can greatly impact how much time you or your staff have to spend administering your benefits. Look for brokers that provide digital enrollment solutions and will handle enrollments and terminations for you. In addition, a good broker can provide employee education and a resource for employees to turn to rather than coming to you or HR for questions. Some even provide HR support systems to help protect your business and empower your admin staff. A support system for success As a franchise owner, your time is valuable, and reducing admin burnout is crucial to maintaining a successful business. It's not just systems that can make your life easier; it’s also the people you choose to partner with. Whether it's your insurance broker, accountant, or franchise payroll provider, listening to their expert advice and allowing them to handle what they know best will make you a more successful and less stressed business owner . So, take a moment to evaluate your current solutions and partners. Are they providing you with good technology? Are they taking things off your plate? Can you rely on them for advice when you need it? Do they make your life easier? If not, then it’s time to explore new options. By focusing on these key areas—hiring, onboarding, and benefits—you can reduce admin burnout and create a more supportive environment for your hourly workers, setting your franchise up for long-term success. Your team—and your peace of mind—will thank you. TAGS HR Resources Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 09/13/24 How to recruit faster with AI restaurant staff management software Share this article In today’s fast-paced world, technology is transforming every industry, and the restaurant business is no exception. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into restaurant staff management software is becoming increasingly popular, promising to revolutionize the way we handle recruitment and talent management. If you’re navigating the vast array of AI tools available, you might feel overwhelmed by the choices. But don’t worry—here are seven practical tips to help you seamlessly integrate AI into your recruitment process and get the most out of your restaurant staff management software. 1. Start with the tools you already use Beginning your AI journey can feel like a big leap, but the good news is that you don’t have to start from scratch. Many of the restaurant staff management software solutions you’re already using may have AI features built right in. By leveraging these familiar platforms, you can save time and resources while still reaping the benefits of AI. For example, some software comes with AI-powered chat tools designed to streamline candidate communication and job description creation —helping you connect with the right talent more efficiently. Using tools you already know means you’re not just jumping on the AI bandwagon—you’re making smart choices that enhance your existing recruitment processes. Plus, this approach minimizes disruptions and allows you to gradually incorporate AI into your daily operations, making the transition smoother for everyone involved. 2. Don’t reinvent the wheel When exploring AI solutions, it’s easy to get caught up in the latest trends. But instead of chasing novelty, focus on finding AI tools that integrate seamlessly into your current workflow. The goal is to enhance productivity, not to add more complexity. For instance, AI-driven communication platforms can improve how quickly and effectively you respond to applicants , leading to a better applicant experience. Prioritizing AI tools that complement your existing restaurant staff management software ensures that you’re not just adopting new technology for the sake of it. You’re making meaningful changes that drive efficiency and improve the overall recruitment process. By building on what you already have, you’ll be able to innovate while staying grounded in proven methods. 3. Take your time In a world where technology evolves rapidly, it’s tempting to jump on every new trend. However, it’s important to balance enthusiasm with caution. Adopting AI too quickly without proper evaluation can lead to unnecessary complications while dismissing it outright might mean missing out on valuable opportunities. Pacing yourself allows you to carefully assess each AI tool’s potential impact on your restaurant staff management software. Conduct thorough research, pilot new tools in controlled environments, and make sure they align with your long-term goals. By taking incremental steps, you’ll reduce risks and ensure that the AI tools you choose truly benefit your recruitment process. 4. Set clear goals Before diving into AI adoption, it’s crucial to define what you want to achieve. Whether your goal is to streamline recruitment, improve employee engagement , or optimize talent management, having clear objectives will guide your choices and help ensure that your AI initiatives align with your restaurant’s needs. Clear goals also make it easier to measure the success of your AI tools. By focusing on specific outcomes, you’ll be able to track progress and make data-driven decisions that enhance your recruitment process and overall staff management. 5. Consider scalability and integration As your restaurant grows, so too will your staffing needs. That’s why it’s essential to choose AI tools that are scalable and can integrate smoothly with your current restaurant staff management software. Scalable solutions ensure that your AI tools can adapt to increased demand, while integration capabilities allow for seamless data sharing across different systems. Selecting AI tools that grow with your business will save you time and money in the long run, making it easier to manage your staff and stay competitive in a fast-paced industry. 6. Prioritize data privacy and ethics With great power comes great responsibility. As AI tools become more data-driven, it’s important to prioritize data privacy and ethical considerations. Ensure that any AI solutions you adopt comply with data protection regulations and maintain transparency about how data is used. This not only protects your employees and applicants but also builds trust in your restaurant’s hiring practices. By putting data privacy and ethics at the forefront of your AI strategy, you’ll reinforce your commitment to responsible AI use and enhance your reputation as a fair and trustworthy employer. 7. Gather feedback and provide training The successful implementation of AI tools depends on the people who use them. That’s why it’s crucial to involve your team in the process, gathering feedback on the tools’ usability and effectiveness. Additionally, providing comprehensive training ensures your staff can make the most of the AI features within your restaurant staff management software. Continuous feedback and training will help you refine your AI processes, driving higher adoption rates and better outcomes. By fostering a culture of learning and improvement, you’ll keep your team engaged and ensure that your restaurant stays ahead of the curve in AI adoption. Navigating the future of restaurant staff management Integrating AI into your restaurant staff management software doesn’t have to be daunting. By following these tips, you can choose AI tools that align with your goals, enhance your recruitment process, and ultimately contribute to the success of your restaurant. Whether you’re leveraging existing tools or exploring new options, the key is to approach AI with a strategic mindset, ensuring that each step you take is in the direction of progress and innovation.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, almost 11 million jobs remain unfilled. But it’s not that hourly workers resist working hard or solely focus on chasing that higher salary—they might just be feeling unfulfilled. The needs of the hourly workforce have been overlooked for too long. Feeling unappreciated, unseen, and uninspired, hourly workers (who comprise 80% of today's global workforce ) are doing something about it, as evidenced by the 150% turnover rate among the hourly workforce. Many feel forced to switch employers or industries to gain a sense of career growth. 80% of toady's global workforce is comprised of hourly workers 150% turnover rate among hourly workforce Rather than address this, many employers have started to view turnover as another cost of doing business. But with each new hire costing an average of $4,600 to acquire and onboard, this turnover is more than an inconvenience. It quickly becomes a financial strain that’s harmful to business. In a competitive job market, hourly employees can no longer be treated as a churn-and-burn commodity. The most obvious solution is this: employees will stick around if they feel supported and believe they can build a career with you. When we think of people as a future workforce pipeline rather than temporary workers, we create an employee experience that fosters growth and opportunity. In this guide, we’ll show you how you can become a best-in-class employer by fostering a work environment where hourly workers can grow—ultimately lowering turnover, encouraging loyalty, and creating staffing stability. Let’s look at the four workplace factors that help attract and retain hourly workers Career advancement A common misconception in the hourly workforce is that employees always chase money and will jump from employer to employer in pursuit of a higher wage. But according to the research shared in a BCG Deskless Worker Sentiment Survey , respondents valued opportunity over pay. Among hourly workers who said they might leave their jobs, 41% cited their employer’s lack of career advancement as the reason, versus 30% of respondents who mentioned pay. 41% of hourly workers would leave their jobs over lack of career advancement 30% would leave because of pay Career advancement isn’t just about getting job opportunities with more prestige or clout. It can also be the pursuit of a rewarding challenge, personal growth, or simply the need for change. If a job looks like a dead end, people seeking a sense of satisfaction from work will soon move on. Tip: Be clear about career advancement opportunities If employee retention is important to your business, demonstrate to your potential hire, as well as your existing workforce, how career growth is a viable (and highly visible) benefit. This means talking about career advancement as early as your job description. Go beyond simply saying there are opportunities for career advancement. Be explicit: Describe what future roles the job can grow into Let applicants know what skills they can acquire on the job Mention any training programs or certifications that come with the job According to a 2022 Great Attrition, Great Attraction 2.0 Global Survey by McKinsey , employees are no longer willing to stay in roles with no clear path for advancement: 41% said they quit their previous job for lack of career development/advancement and 31% for lack of meaningful work. 41% of workers quick their previous job due to lack of career advancement 30% quit due to lack of meaningful work Give people reasons to choose your job by showing opportunities it gives them. Because when you don't, your potential and current employees just might find new jobs that will. \"In a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.\" - Warren Buffet, business magnate, investor, and philanthropist Flexibility and autonomy Prompted by the mandated office closures of early 2020, business professionals started working remotely en masse. Even as the pandemic subsided, many businesses continued to offer their employees flexibility and autonomy over their work lives with the choice of remote or hybrid schedules. Simply because the hourly workforce often can’t work remotely doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t expect (or deserve) flexibility of their own. In fact, 47% of hourly workers would rather work for an organization that provides flexible scheduling and/or increased autonomy over one able to pay 10% more. 87% of employees now expect their employer to help them find a balance between their work and personal obligations. 47% of hourly workers value flexibility over pay 87% of workers expect employers to support work-life balance Tip: Give your employees a say in how they work In an employee-driven labor market defined by record-breaking turnover , most hourly workers realize that they make essential services possible. And they know they have options. Since working from home isn't a possibility for many hourly jobs, companies must come up with other ways to offer autonomy. Working how you want is often as important as working where you want. Demonstrate this by: Empowering hourly workers to make some decisions without your approval Rewarding teams when they improve existing processes or procedures Getting creative where you can with work scheduling and shift flexibility As a general rule, managers must deepen their understanding of what hourly workers actually need. Ask if they're enjoying enough independence on the job and which things they'd like to change. Embrace the idea that every employee is different and might have different approaches to work. Flexibility and autonomy in the workplace is based on the notion that you trust your hourly workers to get things done. And the more you trust your people, the more likely they'll feel engaged at work. \"Giving employees control over when, where, and how they work, is key to attracting and retaining talent.\" - Arvind Malhotra, future of work expert and UNC professor Skill development When comparing possible employers, job seekers look for positions that either match their experience and strengths, or offer the opportunity to build new skills. One Gallup survey found that jobs which offer skill development hold greater value to younger generations—with 87% of millennials citing development in a job as important. 87% of millenials want skill development on the job People don’t want to find themselves committed to a new job without a sense of connection to the work. Without alignment to their goals or current skills, they ultimately move on to something more fulfilling. Tip: Create a culture of learning If potential employees are looking for a career they can grow into, stand out from your competitors by: Creating training or skill development programs to empower hourly workers Encouraging your staff to try new things and build new skills on the job Offering rotations into different roles or the ability to job shadow others Doing so can help your organization find greater appeal among the career-minded applicants—the people who are able and willing to see the big picture. This is how you attract employees who are focused on how they can contribute to your success, not just how your job suits their needs. Candidates who prioritize skill alignment and development aren't just better employees. They're more engaged employees—which can mean they're 87% less likely to resign from their jobs. \"I am convinced that nothing we do is more important than hiring and developing people. At the end of the day, you bet on people, not on strategies.\" - Lawrence Bossidy, author and former business executive Good leadership The support, guidance, and leadership of a good manager makes a big difference—particularly for employees within the hourly workforce. This takes proven people skills, the ability to communicate effectively with hourly workers, and the confidence to provide constructive feedback. However, not all frontline leaders exhibit these attributes. Within many organizations, managers are almost entirely promoted from within without much guidance on how to transition from individual contributor to people leader. New frontline managers may quickly grasp new responsibilities around team scheduling and hitting quotas but don't know what it takes to support and grow their teams. Without the right training, frontline leaders are often ineffective at motivating their teams or giving them a structured work environment—two reasons why good people leave. Tip: Train your managers Help reassure job seekers and new hires that management has their best interests in mind. Provide on-site leadership training for managers at least once a year Tie managers' performance reviews to retention rates on their team's feedback Help managers build soft skills like empathy to improve relationships As you continue to train your managers in the fundamentals of people leadership, encourage them to foster a supportive work environment for their teams. Managers should conduct regular 1:1 conversations with everyone (not just for corrective action) and show them how to advance. Supportive managers also know how and when to recognize employee achievements—both big and small. When personal growth is encouraged, people feel more connected to the workplace. \"The single biggest way to impact an organization is to focus on leadership development. There is almost no limit to the potential of an organization that recruits good people, raises them up as leaders and continually develops them.\" - John Maxwell, best-selling author and leadership expert Show your employees you care, and they'll stick around Most hourly workers would prefer staying with the same employer rather than routinely changing jobs to gain career growth. Making the hourly workforce aware of the unique benefits you're already providing puts your organization at a greater advantage. In too many cases, applicants and current employees aren't aware of the great investments businesses are making to provide better work environments. Build great programs. Treat your team right.

For employers who want to create a better work environment for their employees, here’s a complete employee benefit guide to answer your questions and point you in the right direction. What are employee benefits? Employee benefits are any sort of compensation (whether tangible or intangible) given to employees in addition to their standard wages or salaries. These benefits range from simple perks like free snacks to paid leave, childcare, healthcare, or even bonuses. Anything an employer provides their employees outside of regular pay counts as an employee work benefit. Why benefits for hourly workers matter It’s true; implementing and managing benefits for employees takes time and energy for your HR team—which means it takes money away from your business. But it’s worth it to ensure your hourly workers are happy, healthy, and can sufficiently provide for themselves and their families. When your employees feel like the company cares about their well-being, they’re more likely to stick around for the long term. Employee benefits are one of the best employee retention strategies that you can implement for your business. According to online surveys, 49% of employees will start looking for new jobs in the next year because their current work benefits are insufficient or difficult to understand. Considering the average cost of replacing an employee is between one-half to two times the employee’s annual salary, which can be upwards of $60,000 per incident, providing sufficient employee benefits can actually save your company time and money—not to mention the headache of going through the hiring process time and time again. And speaking of hiring processes, providing sufficient employee benefits can also help you accelerate hiring and find quality candidates. Seeing enticing benefits in a job listing encourages more quality applicants to apply for your positions. Potential applicants are even more likely to apply to a job that pays less than what they want if the benefits meet or exceed their needs. Yes, providing employee benefits will add to your HR workload, but they will also help decrease it in other areas. Your HR team will be able to enjoy faster and smoother hiring processes, along with lower turnover rates. In the end, work benefits save your company time and money. Plus, they help you retain experienced hourly workers, boosting your overall productivity for years to come. 4 types of employee benefits Since benefits include anything beyond standard pay, there's really no limit to the number of employee benefits you can offer. However, most employee benefits packages fall into these four categories: Health and wellness Retirement plans Additional compensation Work/life balance benefits The ideal employee benefits package will contain elements of each of the four types of employee benefits; however, you're welcome to mix-and-match as your company sees fit. Health and wellness Health and wellness benefits are the most common type of employee benefit offered by employers. These are benefits that support an hourly worker's well-being and often show up in the form of insurance. The most common types of insurance benefits are: Health insurance (including medical, dental, and vision) Life insurance Disability insurance Prescription drug coverage Employee assistance Mental health benefits In many cases, employers will match a portion of their hourly worker's insurance costs or provide a base level of coverage that employees can build upon from there. There are some employers that cover the entire cost of insurance for their employees. It all depends on what your company wants to do and can afford. Providing health and wellness benefits shows that your business cares about your hourly workers. Since most health insurance options cover the family as well, it also shows you care about your employees' families as well. Historically, standard health insurance like medical was enough to make employees happy, but times could be changing. According to online polls, 83% of Gen Z employees believe mental health benefits should be a priority in the workplace. This is something that wasn't even on HR professionals' radars even a few years ago, but it's becoming increasingly important for employers to offer more comprehensive health benefits if they want to make their hourly workers happy. Retirement plans One of the best employee benefits are retirement plans. Nobody wants to work forever, and hourly workers want to know that all their hard work will pay off (quite literally) when they’re ready to retire. Retirement benefits show that a business isn’t just invested in their hourly workers for what they can provide right now. Instead, it shows they’re interested in their employees’ entire lives and wants them to feel secure in their future. The most common type of retirement benefit is a 401(k) contribution. With every paycheck, both the hourly workers and the employer contribute to the employee’s 401(k) retirement account. The hourly worker chooses how they want to invest their contributions and how much they want to contribute, and the employer matches a percentage of the employee’s contributions. Employers may also choose to implement a defined retirement plan that’s completely funded by the company, otherwise known as a pension plan. When an employee retires, they receive a set monthly benefit based on their tenure at the company and retirement age. Additional compensation Who couldn’t use a little extra cash every now and then? Additional compensation bonuses are simply monetary bonuses given to hourly workers in addition to their regular pay. These are some of the most common additional compensation bonuses provided by employers: Sales commissions Performance awards (whether individual, department, or company-wide) Lump sum gifts (for outstanding actions, holidays, etc.) Although we all love a little bonus every now and then, there are some arguments against compensation bonuses. The biggest issue with monetary benefits is that it could spur unethical behavior and hinder teamwork. Before implementing additional compensation work benefits, it’s a good idea to clearly outline the bonus policy and give everyone the same opportunity for bonuses. The more transparent, the better. A little competition is good, but unhealthy competition can hurt your work environment. Work/life balance benefits Work/life balance has been a touchy subject for employers and employees for decades. It’s a fine line between optimizing productivity and giving your hourly workers enough time outside of work to do the things they love. Work/life balance benefits are perks designed to help your hourly workers spend more time doing what they enjoy outside of work. The most common work/life balance benefit is paid time off (PTO). Almost 80% of private industry employees have access to paid vacation leave. Although U.S. employers aren’t required to offer paid vacation leave, it can be a great way to give your business a competitive advantage when it comes to hiring and retention. If a potential applicant sees that your company offers PTO and a competitor doesn’t, there’s a good chance they’ll choose to work for you, even if the pay isn’t quite equal. Plus, if you give your hourly workers enough paid time off throughout the year, they won’t get burned out, increasing happiness rates. And happy hourly workers increase your business’s retention rates and boost overall productivity. Other types of work/life employee benefits include parental leave, bereavement, training days, and sabbaticals. Legally mandated work benefits While there are dozens and dozens of employee benefits employers can choose to offer, there are a few benefits employers are required to provide by law. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS): “Legally required benefits provide workers and their families with retirement income and medical care, mitigate economic hardships resulting from loss of work and disability, and cover liabilities resulting from workplace injuries and illnesses.” Under BLS laws, there are four legally mandated work benefits: Social Security and Medicare Workers' compensation insurance Unemployment insurance Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) protections Any applicable employer with full-time hourly workers is required to provide at least these four work benefits. Social Security and Medicare Social Security and Medicare are both considered legally required employee benefits. As such, it’s mandatory for employers to withhold a 6.2% Social Security tax from employee’s gross compensation up to the Social Security wage base. These funds are added to the Social Security program, which the hourly worker can draw upon when they reach retirement age. It acts as a mandatory federal retirement plan. Similarly, employers must also withhold a 1.45% Medicare tax, with additional withholding rules depending on employee’s income. Medicare is a federal healthcare program that people are eligible for once they reach retirement age. Workers’ compensation insurance If a worker can no longer perform their duties after an injury on the job, workers’ compensation covers the medical bills and a portion of their wages until they’re physically fit enough to go back to work. Employers are required to maintain some level of workers’ compensation insurance to protect their hourly workers from the financial burden of potential on-the-job injuries. Unemployment insurance Unemployment insurance assists hourly workers who lose their jobs. Hourly workers may file for unemployment to get financial assistance and temporary benefits during transition periods after being fired or laid off if they meet specific criteria. Employers are required to contribute to unemployment insurance when processing payroll taxes to protect their hourly workers if they ever become unemployed. Each state has different requirements for employer contributions, so make sure you understand the minimum coverage regulations in your area. Most state requirements for unemployment insurance benefits can be met either through self insurance or state-run programs: Self-insurance: The employer agrees to pay for medical bills and income directly in the event of a workplace injury or illness. If you choose this option, you must prove your business has the financial resources necessary to cover potential payouts. State-run programs: Employers can purchase a workers’ compensation insurance policy from the state. The employer pays a monthly fee based on the number of employees, and the insurance pays out in the event of a workplace injury or illness. Basic healthcare protections Because healthcare is such a major cost in the U.S., employers are required to provide a minimum level of healthcare coverage to employees. Applicable large employers (ALEs), which are typically companies with an average of 50 or more full-time employees (including equivalents), must offer adequate and affordable medical coverage for their employees. The specific policies and coverages are up to the employer, but the employee must not pay more than a specific percentage of their income for premiums. Employees should also have access to a reasonable network of healthcare providers, and the plan should cover at least 60% of the cost of medical services. These basic coverages are called the “minimum value standard.” Employers are also required to provide unpaid, job-protected leave for specific medical and family reasons under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). According to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), employers must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per 12-month period for family and medical reasons that qualify, like a chronic personal illness, birth of a child, or caring for immediate family member with a chronic or serious illness. Most common (and best) employee work benefits Although employers are welcome to offer any type of employee benefits they want (as long as they meet the federally required benefits), some benefits are more common than others in the workplace. Here are the top ten most common employee work benefits in the U.S.: Private healthcare plan (medical, dental, and vision) Retirement and/or pension plans Training and development benefits Stock options Flexible hours Life insurance Food and snacks Extended leave (including vacation and sick days) Monetary bonuses, awards, and gifts Company equipment (computer, phone, vehicle, etc.) If you’re wondering which employee benefits are the best, most employees value any and all benefits. There aren’t any specific benefits that are inherently better than others. But typically, the better the benefits you offer, the higher-quality candidates you attract and the lower your turnover rates. Average employer costs According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, employee benefits accounted for 31% of total employer compensation costs in 2022. In some cases, the cost of health benefits alone can reach up to $15,000 annually per hourly worker! While that might seem like a lot (and it is), these benefits are essential if you want to maintain a high-quality hourly workforce. Providing employee benefits does cost your company money, but there are creative ways to lower the cost without hindering your ability to remain competitive or maintain your workforce. For example, never underestimate the power of free lunches or snacks! All over the country, employers are getting creative with their benefits to remain competitive without hurting their bottom line. Here are just a few cost-effective benefits to make your hourly workers happy: Public transit cards or reimbursements for travel expenses, including tolls and gas Company-sponsored discounts for local restaurants, coffee places, gyms, childcare, etc. Free or designated parking spaces Cell phone plans Extra time off for volunteering or training Wellness resources like first-aid training The only limit to the benefits you can offer your hourly workers is your imagination! And remember, employee benefits don’t entirely count as a cost; they’re an investment. If you provide sufficient benefits to your hourly workers, it can increase morale, generate productivity, and boost retention rates—all of which will help your company save money in the long run. Employee benefits management best practices It’s not easy for your HR team to monitor and maintain all the various employee benefits offered by your company—especially if government regulations are involved. To reduce the possibility of errors and limit the strain on your HR team, follow these employee benefits management best practices: Hire a specialist: It's less likely for details to fall through the cracks if someone is dedicated to a task. If you don't already, it's important to hire a dedicated employee benefits specialist to help you find the best options for your company, monitor costs, implement new policies, ensure compliance, and even negotiate prices for some benefits. Stay on top of costs: The cost of employee benefits is rarely static. Make sure your HR team is on top of costs and whether the changing costs are worth the investment over time. Monitoring essential data will help you maintain a successful benefits strategy in the long term. Use the right software: Modern business is all about finding the right software to suit your needs. With a little technological help, you can simplify HR processes and keep a sharper eye on the minor details that come along with employee benefits Include benefit information in your employee handbook: Hourly workers need to know about the benefits if they're going to use and enjoy them. Make sure everyone on your team understands the benefits they have access to by clearly outlining all your benefits in the employee handbook. Talk to your employees: Needs (and wants) change over time. Regularly talk to your hourly workers to see what benefits they want. Your benefits package might change over time to suit your employees' or the worlds' changing desires. Employee benefits bring business benefits Providing benefits for hourly workers isn’t an unnecessary cost for your business; it’s an investment in your workforce. If you can provide your team with benefits beyond their standard paycheck, it gives them the feeling that the company actually cares about them and their lives, increasing retention rates, bringing in the best quality candidates, and boosting morale and productivity. It’s easy to see how providing basic benefits to your hourly workers can “benefit” your business. When you care for your team, your team will care about your business. Providing strong benefits is just one way to improve your employee experience, and employee retention as a result. A worker-first hiring and employee experience helps you attract loyal employees from the start and retain them longer.

After all, nobody works forever. However, understanding your business’ rate of employee turnover is important to its overall success. Businesses with high turnover are chronically short-staffed. The remaining employees experience worse working conditions, making it harder to attract new talent, and that creates a cycle that can spell disaster for the company. A reasonable rate of turnover varies dramatically depending on the organization and industry, so it’s important to understand what kind of turnover your business should be aiming for. Here's what you need to know about employee turnover, how to calculate it , how to understand whether your employee turnover is too high, and what to do about it. What is employee turnover? Employee turnover, or staffing turnover, measures how many employees leave in a particular time period. It refers to all employees who have left the business, including people who were fired or laid off or who left for other reasons, such as transferring, retiring, or changing to a different career. How is employee turnover calculated? To calculate employee turnover , divide the number of people who left the company in a time period by your average number of employees in that time period. Then, multiply by 100. Here’s an example. Say you started the month with 30 employees. Five left and you replaced four of them. Your monthly total employees is 29. Divide 5 by 29, and you get .17. Multiply by 100, and you find that your monthly employee turnover is 17%. Only include employees who have permanently left to the best of your knowledge. Temporary employees or employees on leave should not be counted as staff turnovers. Should you calculate voluntary and involuntary staff turnovers separately? All organizations experience both voluntary and involuntary turnover. Voluntary turnover is any situation in which an employee chooses to leave. Involuntary turnover is when it is the employer's choice to terminate the relationship. Does the reason matter when you're thinking about how many employees have left your company? Possibly. It can be helpful to calculate these kinds of staff turnovers separately. If you find that your company has many more employees that leave by quitting than firing, or vice versa, it may be an opportunity to examine how you’re handling employee relations. This is also a chance to more closely examine the circumstances under which people leave your company. This kind of investigation can be hugely beneficial when it comes to reducing employee turnover and improving work experiences at your company. What is a good employee turnover rate? The expected employee turnover for a business depends on what kind of company it is. Some industries, such as hotels or restaurants, have higher turnover than others, like government jobs or white-collar industries. For instance, the monthly employee turnover rate in fast food restaurants was 144% this year. So, if a fast food restaurant typically staffs about 30 people, 43 people left the team in just one month. If you're in the fast food industry and comparing yourself to most other industries, you probably think your turnover is terrible at a rate of over 100%, but it’s actually very reasonable for your business. Acceptable turnover for your company depends entirely on what line of work you're in. A variety of factors specific to your business can also affect turnover. For instance, if you’re doing business somewhere with a high seasonal population, such as a college town, you'll likely see higher turnover than similar companies in places with more stable populations. The best way to understand whether your employee turnover is acceptable is to compare your turnover to that of businesses that are as similar to yours as possible. Is 20% employee turnover high? For the vast majority of industries, a turnover of 20% is reasonable but on the higher side of what’s acceptable. The majority of organizations have a turnover rate between 12% and 20%. Of course, as discussed above, many industries have much higher turnover rates. Whether the rate is too high for your business depends on the employee turnover cost . For companies that invest little into training and recruiting their workers, losing an employee isn't a significant loss. However, for companies that aggressively search for the best talent and put a lot of energy into training them, a high turnover rate can be devastating for the company's bottom line. In general, businesses that employ highly technical and experienced workers would see 20% turnover as the highest they would be willing to tolerate, whereas businesses employing employees with less experience and training are typically OK with higher turnover rates, even rates over 100%. What causes employee turnover? Employee turnover is a perfectly natural part of any business. However, understanding the reasons employees leave is valuable. Knowing about your company's employee turnover can enable you to anticipate and reduce employee turnover . Here are a few of the primary reasons employees leave a company. Retirement Retirement is one of the most predictable causes of turnover, but there can still be unexpected spikes. In the third quarter of 2020, a whopping 28.6 million baby boomers retired, 3.2 million more than in the same quarter of the previous year. Global events like a pandemic or economic events like recessions can cause employees who may be close to retirement age to retire early or keep working longer. Anticipating these swings in retirement can help companies plan for them. Employee shortages When everybody is scrambling for employees, the workers have the upper hand. This is a strong driver of employee turnover up and down the economic ladder, from low-wage employees seeking out the restaurant that pays the most to highly skilled technical professionals being head-hunted by competing firms. It's not just money that employees are after either. Employees are leaving for better hours, more extensive benefits , and flexibility. If you know what your employees are likely to leave for, you’re more likely to find ways to keep them. Lack of opportunity If there's nowhere within a company for an employee to grow into, they'll grow out of the company. There's certainly some degree to which all companies will experience this kind of progress, but whenever possible, it's beneficial to give employees space to move up in the company instead of losing them. Providing training or financial assistance for education that allows employees to fill new roles is a powerful way to keep the talent you've invested in. Unhappy at work Not every employee is a good fit for every job. Some employees find their role unsatisfactory, regardless of how good the company is at acclimating and training them. Some employees become tired of their jobs even though little has changed. However, factors like a toxic work environment, poor management, and chronic overwork can make even loyal employees think about leaving. Learn how your employees feel about their work and where they think there could be improvements before their dissatisfactions drive them to work somewhere else. Poor work-life balance Some employees are perfectly happy at work, but their work is making it impossible for them to be happy elsewhere. Erratic schedules, long hours, physically or mentally taxing work, or excessive stress can make it difficult for employees to thrive in their home life. Over time, they may be driven away from a job they enjoy as a result. This often occurs as younger employees grow within the company, get families and personal lives, and find that they can no longer keep up with the pace of their work. Understanding the stress a job puts on an employee can enable you to spread work more evenly or hire more employees for a role when necessary. Feeling unappreciated Employees don't just want a schedule and a paycheck. They want to feel that what they do every day matters and that their efforts have value beyond the money it brings in. Even if an employee is relatively happy at work, successfully balancing their work and personal life, and isn't looking for more advanced opportunities, simply feeling that management is indifferent to their efforts can be enough to cause some people to look for another position. This becomes more likely the longer somebody is with a company. As the employee begins feeling a greater sense of loyalty to the business, they want to feel that the business cares about and appreciates them. What is the cost of high employee turnover? Regardless of what kind of business you run, you want employee turnover to be as low as possible. It's true that some businesses are chronically plagued by high employee turnover . However, it reflects very well on your likelihood of success if your company has lower turnover rates than your competition. Here are some of the consequences of a high turnover rate. Employees want to work at businesses with low turnover Potential employees take turnover rates into account when choosing whether to work at your business or not. If your company has a reputation for employees who leave soon after being hired, whether they quit or are fired, you'll likely find it more difficult to attract new talent. On the other hand, if your company is known for satisfied employees, you probably won't have difficulty filling the vacancies you do have. Replacing employees can be expensive The more you've invested into an employee, the more you lose when they quit. Even in industries with typically high turnover, it's easy to see the cost of hiring and replacing an employee. There are uniforms to be bought and distributed, shadowing time with another employee to learn what needs to be done, and early mistakes as the new trainee gets the hang of things. The more often this has to happen, the more expensive it gets. High turnover is a hit to morale Most companies rely on their current employees to train new employees. However, this relationship doesn't just extend to the basics of getting the job done. Company culture is also passed along from long-term employees to new employees. Workers who have been with the company for a long time are a powerful force for maintaining and disseminating company values. If your business fails to keep long-term employees, you'll lose this powerful stabilizer of culture. Remaining employees suffer when you’re short-staffed High turnover often goes hand in hand with chronic understaffing. While you're struggling to replace the person who has left, remaining employees take on the burden of extra work. The remaining employees are now laden with additional work and the responsibility of training a new hire to replace the person who has left. Companies that chronically put their employees in this situation are likely to see even more employees leave. How to reduce employee turnover What is employee retention ? Reducing employee turnover by even a few points can make a difference in how smoothly your business operates. While some types of businesses will always experience higher turnover than others, there are things you can do to bring down your company's turnover rate, regardless of what industry you're in. Write a good job description The first step to reducing the number of employees that leave your business is making it more likely that they wanted to be there in the first place. Job descriptions that are overly rosy, vague, or don't accurately describe the job that needs to be done attract employees who quit soon after they realize what the job really is. If you notice that a lot of your turnover comes from employees quitting soon after starting, a poor job description may be the culprit. Pay attention to who you hire Be discerning about the people you choose to hire and train. Companies that hire unskilled workers often don't put a lot of effort into screening and end up wasting a lot of energy training people who are not likely to thrive in the role they've been hired for. If a significant amount of employee turnover comes from employees who quit during or soon after training, it may be that you aren't recruiting people who are likely to do well in the position you need to fill. Be deliberate about onboarding The majority of training and onboarding at most companies is done by current employees, typically with a shadowing or mentoring program. There's nothing wrong with this kind of system for onboarding, but management needs to be conscious of ensuring it is done correctly. Employees who are frustrated by the extra work it takes to train somebody or are looking for an opportunity to take it easy for a shift may skirt some of the responsibilities of onboarding. Even small oversights at the beginning can lead to mistakes in understanding that cause major issues and bad feelings down the road. Make sure that only responsible employees are put in charge of training and properly motivate them to train the new employees well. Communicate with your employees Effective communication that keeps employees happy and wanting to work at your company goes both ways. It is, of course, important for you to give employees feedback so that they do their jobs well. However, it’s just as important for you to elicit feedback from your employees. Learn what they like about their jobs and where they're struggling. Are they having a hard time maintaining a good work-life balance? Do they feel that management is responding appropriately to their needs and concerns? Do they work well with their teammates? Learn how your employees feel about their everyday work experience , and you'll be much more likely to catch problems before they turn into something worth quitting over. This is also a good opportunity to learn when an employee may be looking for places to branch out so you can give them a path for advancement within your company instead of having them leave for another opportunity. Actively build loyalty Loyalty is too often overlooked because it is a soft resource that can be difficult to pin down. However, employees who feel loyal to you and your company are more likely to stick it out and stay with you, even if there may be another good opportunity on the horizon or your company is going through a difficult patch. Recognize your employees' achievements, foster bonding activities by hosting parties or playing games, and build a company culture of mutual respect. Take the time to learn about your employees' lives, what they're passionate about, and what brings them joy. Even something as simple as tasking an employee who loves to garden with choosing and caring for plants at your location or allowing a sports fan to decorate and host a party centered around a sports event can be all it takes to develop powerful loyalty in the employee you single out and the employees around them as well. Give employees reasons to stay Raises that correspond with time spent at a company and new skills that employees gain while they're with your business keep your current employees with you and inspire new employees to stay longer and do more. While raises and benefits are often controlled by your budget and the position, it’s worth finding wiggle room to reward superior performance. Some perks, like more flexibility in the schedule or the opportunity to manage certain tasks that require a good deal of responsibility, can come free but mean a lot to the employee. Even a heartfelt conversation with an employee about how much you value them and why you can’t offer a bigger raise right now can convince an employee to feel positive about working for you. Retain your team longer Regardless of your business, it is beneficial to reduce employee turnover. There's nothing you can do to eliminate turnover at your company completely, but by recruiting carefully, communicating well, actively building loyalty, and giving employees plenty of reasons to stay, you'll likely find that you can significantly reduce your company's turnover. You'll find that you spend less time and money hiring and training and that business runs more smoothly when you commit to reducing employee turnover.

The term encompasses the entire process by which employees are hired and integrated into your team. Onboarding starts even before new-hire orientation; it also includes education and training about the business, its mission and vision, and workplace culture and values. Each company’s new employee onboarding plan is different depending on size, setup, and what type of work the organization does. Some businesses do this in a day or two of conference-style seminars, individual online classes, or months’ worth of activities with other colleagues. The basics of employee onboarding Every single new hourly worker is onboarded, whether or not you have a structured new employee onboarding plan. When an hourly worker gets the “lay of the land,” they’re being onboarded. However, many companies take this to mean only completing paperwork and being shown around their new job. New employee onboarding best practices should include much deeper attention and intention so that employees feel welcomed into the folds of the company. They should understand from the start that they are valued and supported —their role is important, and they will have the assistance they need to succeed. The phases of onboarding Onboarding shouldn’t be confused with orientation, although orientation is often one of the first steps in new employee onboarding best practices. During orientation, the employee completes paperwork and other necessary tasks. Still, new employee onboarding is more comprehensive and concerns overall training and culture immersion versus only collecting social security numbers and HR-pertinent information. The following are phases of successful new employee onboarding. (Note that orientation might not even be first!) Your company can and should take these as a starting point and individualize them to work for your particular needs. Pre-boarding Pre-boarding consists of engaging the employee after they’ve been hired but before they begin working. This helps make the employee feel welcomed and invested in, and gives them a chance to begin feeling comfortable with all aspects of a company before they are required to perform duties or complete projects. It might include any of the following: Sending a welcome package with company swag Touring the facility Educating the employees about benefits programs (e.g., healthcare, retirement) Connecting the employees with a colleague who can answer questions and give them more basic information Orientation Orientation is the specific session of new employee onboarding in which the person fills out paperwork and gets officially enrolled into the company. It often includes many of the following components: Signing paperwork and getting set up with payroll Reading and committing to following handbook policies and procedures Completing mandatory training Learning about the structure, mission, vision, and values of the company (often through reading literature or engaging in an online course) This phase of the employee onboarding process can be quite overwhelming, so new employee onboarding best practices usually spread this over at least a couple of days, if not longer. Some companies may turn to digital onboarding to enable new hires to work through this process on their own schedule at home before they start on the job. Foundation building From an employee engagement perspective, this is possibly the most important phase of new employee onboarding. However, it’s often overlooked once the orientation steps are completed. During foundation building, every new employee develops their understanding of the company’s brand, workplace culture, and shared values. These aren’t always given out directly, either—an employee picks up the information and knowledge piece by piece through varied interactions and experiences. A company ensures that a new employee’s foundation is strong by paying close attention to how they are faring for the first few months of their employment. The team lead should follow up with them and engage in conversation surrounding company values, the employees’ strengths and areas of development, and their desired future. Mentoring and coaching Taking on a new position in a company where you want to be successful can be overwhelming. What do your bosses expect, and how are day-to-day situations handled? Who do you go to for those basic questions that seem too small-time for the busy higher-ups? Who can you look to as a partner on your level? Assigning a mentor or a coach gives new employees a “safe space” in which they can feel encouraged and supported without being judged or looked down on for needing help while they transition. This mentor or coach can guide and direct without having to be “in charge” of the new employee. Once an employee feels that they are solidly engaged in the company and their role, perhaps they will want to take on the role of mentoring or coaching someone else. This is a great way for them to feel valued and respected while reaffirming the goals and mission of the company, essentially strengthening their foundation as they grow. Re-boarding This step isn’t always necessary but is especially important for people who have left the company for some time and are returning or for employees who are transferring to a different division or position within the company. Let’s say someone was out on medical or family leave for a few months. They will need to meet new employees and get up to speed on changed policies or new initiatives. The company could show their positivity about the return with a welcome back luncheon or gathering, too, to show that they were missed. If an employee is moving into a different team or getting promoted, their reboarding process might include intensive training specific to their new role. They will need to learn about processes in that area of the company and whom they report to, as well as who reports to them. This process should include short- and long-term goal-setting and possibly pairing with a mentor or coach again. Important onboarding components Successful new employee onboarding (and continued “reboarding” for returning employees) has each of the previous steps, but each of those steps is filled with particular qualities that ensure success. The leadership and HR team, as well as the rest of the company, can set an organization up for success in new employee onboarding. Preparing ahead of time with focused attention on a few specific areas can mean that your new employees feel welcomed and supported and that the entire team has a positive attitude toward new talent coming on board. Onboarding is everyone’s job If asked, most employees would probably say that new employee onboarding is the job of the boss and the HR department. However, a successful company knows that everyone is a part of the workplace culture, and thus, everyone is a part of teaching new employees how things flow and what the team culture is. An employee onboarding checklist can be crucial so that everyone has the same routine and nothing gets lost in translation when onboarding employees. Unique onboarding experiences Although new employee onboarding best practices are key, that doesn’t mean that everyone should have the same experience. Think critically about the role each new employee will have at the company and what their particular needs are. Work with the HR department to create more individualized onboarding practices for particular groups of people or hand-select mentors that show experience in these areas. Managers These people know how to lead and have had success in this field but they need to know how it applies to the particular organization or division. Differently-abled team members How will they be accommodated and made to feel comfortable asking for help? Military veterans What support will they receive in transitioning to a civilian role? Second-chance workers Employees in this category also need extra support and acclimation time, especially when it comes to feeling valued and respected. Onboarding assessment Onboarding should be a dynamic process. You want to know if your onboarding practices are effective and if people feel supported and engaged from the get-go. Utilize a few of these strategies to get a full, accurate picture of what people experience when coming on board with your company. Time-productivity ratios How long does it take for an employee to get “situated” and begin adding value? The better an onboarding program is, the lower this ratio will be. Turnover and retention rates How often are you having to onboard new employees because of dissatisfied ones? Are people staying on the team to move into new positions or leaving because they weren’t supported? New employee surveys Deliver employee engagement surveys throughout the onboarding process and after to get an accurate picture of how people feel and what they need. Informal feedback Engage in casual conversation and informal check-ins to develop relationships and show that you are invested in an employee’s success and well-being. Start your workers off on the right foot New employee onboarding doesn’t have to be difficult. Taking time to prepare your company’s particular new employee onboarding process and regularly assessing its efficacy means you’ll be setting your employees (and your business) up for success.

An engaged workforce will lead to a strong company culture, low turnover, and fantastic results, while a disengaged workforce can easily lead to the exact opposite.  In this guide, we will explore the importance of employee engagement, how to assess and measure it, and strategies for improving it. Why does employee engagement matter? Employee engagement is more than just a buzzword—it has a real impact on the success of a business. When employees are engaged, they are more motivated, productive, and committed to their work. This leads to a range of benefits for the organization, including: Increased productivity: Engaged employees are more likely to go above and beyond in their work, resulting in higher productivity and better business outcomes. Improved retention: Engaged employees are less likely to leave their jobs, which can save a company money and resources on recruitment and training. Enhanced customer satisfaction: When employees are engaged, they are more likely to provide better customer service, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Better financial performance: Companies with high levels of employee engagement tend to have better financial performance, as engaged employees contribute to increased productivity and profitability. To put it even more simply, employee engagement matters because it directly impacts a business's success and competitiveness. By prioritizing engagement and creating a positive work environment, businesses can drive better outcomes and create a sustainable competitive advantage. Engaged workers vs disengaged workers Many employers find it difficult to accurately assess just how much of a difference an engaged worker can have on their business over a disengaged worker. Engaged workers Disengaged workers Highly motivated and committed to their work Lack motivation and commitment to their work Efficient and productive in their role Less productive and may require more supervision Regular attendance and low absenteeism Higher absenteeism and may call out sick more frequently Produce high-quality work that meets or exceeds expectations Produce lower-quality work that may not meet expectations Positive attitude towards their work and the organization Negative attitude towards their work and the organization Adaptable to change and open to new ideas Resistant to change and less likely to embrace new ideas Loyal to the organization and invested in its success May consider leaving their job or less invested in the success of the company Engage in continuous learning and development May not prioritize learning and development Actively participate in company events and culture May be less involved in company events and culture Willing to go above and beyond in their role Less likely to go above and beyond in their role What's the difference between employee engagement and the employee experience? Employee engagement and employee experience are related but ultimately distinct concepts. Employee engagement refers to the level of commitment, motivation, and connection that employees feel towards their work and their organization. It’s a measure of how invested an employee is in their work and how likely they are to go above and beyond in their role. On the other hand, the employee experience refers to the overall experience of being an employee at a company, including factors such as the work environment, culture, leadership, and development opportunities. It encompasses all aspects of an employee's time with a company, from onboarding to daily work tasks to interactions with colleagues and leadership. While employee engagement is an important part of the employee experience, it’s just one aspect of it. Other factors, such as work-life balance, growth and development opportunities, and the overall work culture, can also impact the employee experience. In short, employee engagement is a measure of an employee's connection to their work and their organization, while the employee experience is a broader concept that encompasses all aspects of an employee's time with a company. Both are important for the success and satisfaction of employees, and businesses should strive to optimize both to create a positive and supportive work environment. Whose job is it to worry about employee engagement? Management plays a particularly important role in shaping the level of employee engagement within an organization. Leaders set the tone for the company culture and can inspire and motivate employees through their actions and words. They should be open to feedback and ideas and be willing to listen and address the concerns of their team members. In addition to management, it is important for all employees to take ownership of their own engagement and be proactive in finding ways to stay motivated and connected to their work. This might involve setting personal goals, seeking out new challenges and learning opportunities, and actively participating in company culture and events. Ultimately, employee engagement is a shared responsibility and requires the involvement and commitment of all team members. By working together and creating a positive and supportive work environment, businesses can improve employee engagement and drive better outcomes for all. Assessing employee engagement Measuring your current employee engagement level is perhaps the most important early step in improving it. There are a number of ways to assess employee engagement, including surveys, focus groups, and one-on-one conversations with employees. Common employee engagement survey questions might include: How motivated are you to perform your job well? How invested are you in the success of the company? How well do you understand the goals and objectives of the company? Do you feel that your work is meaningful and impactful? How well do you feel your skills and talents are utilized in your role? Do you feel that you have the support and resources you need to be successful in your job? Do you feel that your contributions are recognized and appreciated? Do you feel that there are opportunities for growth and development in your current role or within the company? How satisfied are you with the work environment and company culture? Do you feel that your work-life balance is manageable and supportive of your overall well-being? It’s important to provide a range of possible answers, such as a scale from 1-5, to ensure you get the most accurate answers. Interpreting the results of an employee engagement survey can be challenging, as it’s important to consider the specific needs and concerns of each individual team or department. It may be helpful to compare the results to industry benchmarks or to track employee engagement strategies over time to see if they are having a positive impact. While surveys are a fantastic tool to measure employee engagement, there are some other methods you can try too. One-on-one conversations: Meeting with employees individually can provide an opportunity to get a more in-depth understanding of their engagement levels and any areas for improvement. Focus groups: Gathering employees together in a focus group setting can provide a forum for discussion and feedback on engagement issues. Employee task forces: Creating task forces or committees that focus on employee engagement can provide a structured way for employees to provide input and employee engagement ideas . Observations: Observing employees in their work environment can provide insight into engagement levels, including things like body language, work quality, and interactions with colleagues. Metrics: Tracking metrics such as retention rates, productivity levels, and customer satisfaction scores can provide an indication of overall engagement levels within the organization. Exit interviews: Asking departing employees about their experience and engagement levels while with the company can provide valuable insights into areas for improvement. Improving employee engagement There are a number of strategies that businesses can use to improve employee engagement. These include: Communication: Effective communication is essential for employee engagement. This includes regular check-ins with team members, transparent communication from leadership, and a willingness to listen to and address employee concerns. Communication can be improved through the use of tools like employee surveys, focus groups, and suggestion boxes. The impact of improved communication can be measured through increased employee participation in company events and decision-making processes, as well as higher scores on engagement surveys related to communication. Culture and work environment: A positive work culture and environment can go a long way in improving team engagement. This includes creating a sense of community and inclusivity, promoting work-life balance, and fostering a culture of trust and respect. The impact of a positive work culture can be measured through employee surveys, focus groups, and retention rates. Growth and development opportunities: Providing opportunities for training, development, and career advancement can help employees feel more invested in their work and their organization. The impact of these opportunities can be measured through employee feedback and the success of employees who have participated in employee engagement programs . Recognition and appreciation: Recognizing and appreciating the contributions of employees can help improve their engagement and motivation. This can include formal recognition programs, as well as more informal gestures of appreciation. The impact of recognition and appreciation can be measured through employee surveys and retention rates. Work-life balance: Ensuring that employees have a healthy work-life balance is essential for maintaining healthy people engagement. This might include offering flexible work arrangements, promoting the importance of taking breaks and vacations, and providing resources for stress management. The impact of work-life balance can be measured through employee satisfaction surveys and absenteeism rates. Collaborative decision-making: Involving employees in decision-making processes can help to improve their engagement and ownership of their work. This can be achieved through tools like suggestion boxes, town hall meetings, and employee committees. The impact of collaborative decision-making can be measured through employee feedback and the success of initiatives that were the result of employee input. Feedback and performance management: Providing regular, constructive feedback and a clear performance management process can help to improve employee engagement by giving employees a sense of direction and support. The impact of effective feedback and performance management can be measured through employee satisfaction surveys and improved performance metrics. Health and wellness programs: Offering wellness programs and resources can help to improve employee engagement by promoting physical and mental well-being. This might include offering gym memberships, mental health resources, and healthy eating options. The impact of wellness programs can be measured through employee participation rates and improved health metrics such as absenteeism and healthcare costs. Flexible work arrangements: Offering flexible work arrangements can help improve employee engagement by allowing employees to have more control over their schedules. The impact of flexible work arrangements can be measured through employee satisfaction surveys and retention rates. Employee involvement and empowerment: Empowering employees and giving them a voice in the decision-making process can help improve workforce engagement and ownership of their work. This can be achieved through tools like employee committees, suggestion boxes, and leadership development programs. The impact of employee empowerment can be measured through employee feedback and the success of initiatives that were the result of employee input. How do you measure the success of an employee engagement program? Any decent program is worthless without the means to measure how effective it is, and employee engagement programs are no different. Define success Before implementing any engagement initiatives, it’s important to define what success looks like for your organization. This might include identifying specific metrics such as retention rates, productivity levels, or customer satisfaction scores. Having clear goals in place will help guide your engagement efforts and allow you to measure their effectiveness. Assess the current state of employee engagement To effectively improve employee engagement, it’s important to understand the current level of engagement within your organization. This can be done through employee surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one conversations with employees. This will help to identify areas for improvement and guide the development of engagement strategies. Monitor the implementation of engagement strategies Once you have a clear understanding of the current state of engagement and your goals for improvement, you can begin to implement engagement strategies. These might include things like holding regular check-ins with employees, providing growth and development opportunities, or implementing recognition and appreciation programs. Measure and track progress To effectively manage the success of engagement efforts, it’s important to regularly measure and track progress. This can be done through employee surveys, focus groups, or through the use of metrics such as retention rates, productivity levels, or customer satisfaction scores. By tracking progress, you can identify what’s working well and what areas may need further improvement. Make adjustments as needed As you implement engagement strategies and track progress, you may find that certain approaches are more effective than others. It’s important to be flexible and willing to make adjustments as needed in order to optimize the success of your engagement efforts. Managing employee engagement for the long term Managing employee engagement programs over the long term requires a sustained and strategic approach. It’s not enough to think of employee engagement as a one-and-done task. It needs to be nurtured and continuously managed to ensure these programs bear fruits in the long run. Make employee engagement a priority Employee engagement should always be a priority for leadership and a core part of the company's culture. This means regularly communicating the importance of engagement, being open to employee feedback and ideas, and consistently taking action to address employee concerns. The moment these programs fall out of focus, your workers will realize, and results will likely plummet. Ensure alignment with business goals These programs will ultimately be limited in how effective they can be if they don’t properly align with the business’s goals. You need to find the right balance and create a real sense of synergy to both get the best out of your employees and ensure their long-term engagement. Involve employees in program design and implementation It’s easy to fall into the trap of forcing policies in a top-down matter, but a truly successful employee engagement strategy needs to involve your employees. This might involve gathering employee feedback through surveys or focus groups or involving employees in the decision-making process. Measure and track progress Regularly measuring and tracking the impact of engagement programs can help you identify what’s working well and what areas may need improvement. You can follow some of the suggestions we provided in the earlier section on measuring progress. Make adjustments as needed As engagement programs evolve over time, it may be necessary to make adjustments in order to optimize their impact. This might involve updating program offerings or revising program goals based on feedback and data. Again, you need to treat employee engagement as a living, breathing organism and make the right changes as needed. Engaged employees stick around longer Improving employee engagement is a continuous process that requires ongoing effort and attention. By understanding the factors that contribute to engagement, regularly assessing and measuring it, and implementing strategies to improve it, businesses can create a positive work environment and culture that drives success. Companies that prioritize employee engagement are more likely to retain top talent, boost productivity, and improve overall performance. As such, it’s essential for businesses to prioritize employee engagement as a key part of their HR strategy.

But what if we told you that encouraging employees to post about their jobs can be an almost effortless part of your hiring strategy? With social media use more prevalent than ever before , especially among Gen Z and Millenials, platforms like Facebook, Instagram , and TikTok are becoming the best places to attract new employees to your business. In fact, 86% of job seekers turn to social media when job hunting. So while you should have some guardrails in place around on-the-job social media use to ensure employees are supporting your business (instead of getting sucked into scrolling), encouraging employees to capture their work environment on social media can be a great hiring tool. When it comes to employee-generated content, there are two ways to go about it: get employees to post directly on your company’s social account (hello, employee takeovers!) or have your employees post to their personal accounts, tagging your business. Either way, getting employees involved in generating content has two major advantages. Authenticity Creating storytelling pieces such as day in the life videos provides a compelling, unbiased view of the job and company culture through the eyes of your employees. Positive work culture is one of the top criteria job seekers look for when job hunting. So, such content may attract like-minded individuals to apply for a job in your company. It also lets job seekers in on what a job is like and what it entails, helping them manage their expectations about the job. And when a job meets the expectations of your new hires, you can hope for higher retention rates in the long run too! Reach Aside from showing a more authentic side of your company, involving your employees in your social media strategy can also get your content a wider audience. Whether your employees are posting directly from their own accounts and tagging you or posting through your business account and resharing to their own, cross-promoting content is the easiest way to expand your audience. And if your employees are featured or creating the content, they’ll be more likely to share it. This is exactly what Walmart is doing. The retail giant has an exclusive program called Spotlight that’s dedicated to turning its workers into small-scale influencers for the company. Under this program, employees show behind-the-scenes of their jobs and even promote some of the new services Walmart offers. Now, imagine doing the same but for your hiring campaigns! Time Coming up with creative content that attracts prospective employees can take a lot of work. But your employees live and breathe social media. Coming up with on-trend content comes naturally and quickly to them. By pulling them into the process, you make it easier to collect tons of posts and schedule them out in advance, saving you time without sacrificing quality. If you don’t have a social media account for your company, check out our article to get some tips on how you can get started ! But if you already do, read on to find out how you can leverage your team to create amazing social content for your platforms. How to encourage your employees to post work-related content Make it a part of their work schedule The easiest way to get your employees to create social content is to build that responsibility into their work. Put a chart in the break room and have employees earn rewards for creating a certain amount of content during a set time period, or reward employees that create content that has high engagement rates. You can even create “social shifts;” an extra hour a week where employees come in solely to work on social content creation. But before jumping right into it, ensure that you impose some guidelines on the social media content they can share. Here are some you can start off with: Create a list of do’s and don’ts so their content won’t spark any negative backlash Share some brand style guidelines, such as how to use your brand logo correctly Create an approval process so you get eyes on content before its posted Give recognition to your employees on your personal accounts Actions speak louder than words, so don’t just encourage your employees to post but also do so on your account. For example, you can give a shoutout to top performers or repost their work-related content to show your appreciation. Doing so not only encourages your employees to post on their respective social media platforms but also helps to build a personal brand for yourself, which is important as it gives a more personable impression of you as a business owner. Thus, when users see such content, they are more likely to recommend their peers to your company as they view you as a supportive boss who creates a good environment for their workers. Provide referral benefits Sometimes, nothing works better than giving additional benefits! If your employee has a good following, encourage them to post about open positions on their personal platforms. Let it be known to your team that a referral benefit will be rewarded should someone get hired and retained through their social post. Don’t forget to create a system that makes it easy for you to track the referrers so that the right people get rewarded! Leverage hourly employees to create social media content In this digital age, social media can be a useful hiring tool for you to attract and reach out to job seekers. Many hourly employees are already turning to social media to post about their days on the job, though in most cases, this content isn’t officially vetted by the company or cross-promoted. Take advantage of your team’s social savviness to attract more employees like them.

While finding and hiring top talent is essential, keeping those hourly workers happy and engaged is the secret ingredient for long-term success. One of the biggest challenges in the QSR world is overworked hourly workers. When your team is stretched too thin, it’s easy for them to feel the heat and eventually burn out, leading to high turnover rates. Dr. Kathy Gosser, Director of the Young Centre for Global Franchise Excellence at the University of Louisville, has done some deep research on this topic, shining a light on the negative impact of overwork on hourly workers. But don’t worry—there are plenty of ways to make sure your team doesn’t get fried. Here are seven strategies that can help your hourly workers feel less overworked and more appreciated. 1. Don't schedule fewer hourly workers than you need This might seem like an obvious one, but too often, operators try to cut labor costs by scheduling a lean team. And while this works in the short term, it's a surefire way to burn out your hourly workers and leave your customers with less-than-optimal service. By using advanced scheduling tools and workforce management software, you can ensure that shifts are properly staffed and the workload is shared evenly. This keeps everything running smoothly, reducing stress for your team and serving up a better experience for your customers. 2. Create a positive work environment A happy crew leads to happy customers! When your hourly workers feel valued, supported, and part of something bigger, they’re less likely to feel overworked and more likely to bring their A-game every day. Encourage teamwork, celebrate successes, and make sure everyone knows they’re a crucial part of the mix. 3. Collect feedback from your hourly workers regularly Regularly checking in with your hourly workers can help you catch any signs of overwork before they boil over. Automated surveys are a great way to gather honest feedback and understand what your employees are really thinking. Use this information to make adjustments and keep the workplace running smoothly. Workstream Hiring Tip: Get ahead of the curve by conducting regular, short surveys with Workstream . With customizable templates and a mobile-friendly experience, it’s a piece of cake to gather feedback and track completion all in one place. 4. Prioritize training and support Comprehensive training programs help your hourly workers feel confident and prepared, reducing the stress that comes with uncertainty. By offering ongoing support and development opportunities, you’re showing your team that you’re committed to their growth, not just their output. 5. Embrace flexibility A good work-life balance is essential for your team’s well-being. Flexible scheduling, regular breaks, and paid time off all help make the job more satisfying and help prevent burnout . When your hourly workers know they have time to rest and recharge, they’ll be ready to serve up their best every day. 6. Streamline operations Streamlining your processes isn’t just about getting more done; it’s about creating a work environment where productivity thrives, and your team stays energized and motivated, reducing the risk of burnout. Tools like point-of-sale (POS) systems and kitchen display systems make order processing a breeze. Digital paperwork and app-based shift scheduling help everyone work smarter, not harder. When you bring in lean principles and focus on continuous improvement, you’re not just cutting out the clutter—you’re giving your hourly workers the freedom to concentrate on what really matters. It’s all about freeing up time and resources so your team can shine in the areas that count the most. 7. Provide opportunities for growth Nobody wants to feel stuck in a dead-end job. Offering clear paths for advancement is a great way to build a loyal workforce that's more likely to stick around. Recognize their achievements, offer incentives, and watch your team rise to the occasion. By mixing in the right strategies, you can prevent your hourly workers from feeling overworked and keep them sizzling with enthusiasm. Remember, a well-supported team is the secret to a thriving business. So, let’s whip up a positive and sustainable work environment that benefits everyone—because when your team is happy, your customers are too!

Human capital management (HCM) refers to the process of workforce management. HCM software has been used to help businesses get the most out of their workforce. This guide will answer the question of what human capital management is while also discussing the benefits HCM can have for your business. What is HCM? Human capital management (HCM) is a term that refers to the process of managing an organization's workforce. This includes activities such as recruiting new employees, onboarding them, training them, and managing their performance. To manage an organization's human capital effectively, businesses can implement a human capital management software solution. This history of HCM In the 1950s, the concept of human capital management first began to emerge. As the nature of work began to evolve, so too did the way we thought about employees. Thanks to advancements in computing and automation, employees were no longer viewed as cogs in a machine or steps in an assembly line. These advancements gave way to the rise of a new class of workers: the knowledge worker. Unlike their predecessors, these employees would provide a whole new level of value to a business as they were able to create, innovate, and think critically. It was this change in the workforce that led to the development of human capital management to manage and motivate these new employees. In its simplest form, HCM can be defined as a process that helps businesses to get the most out of their employees Fast forward to today, and there are many different careers that come out of human capital management. Whether it's in human capital management consulting or in HCM strategy, there are many opportunities to have a long career in this field. What are the elements of human capital management? There are many human capital management jobs out there due to how many elements there are within human capital management. Several of these elements include: Recruiting The process of sourcing and hiring new employees is one of the key elements of human capital management. This involves using a variety of methods to source potential candidates, such as posting job listings, leveraging recruiting agencies, or promoting roles on social media platforms. Onboarding Once a new employee has been hired, it’s important to onboard them properly . This includes providing them with information about their role and the company, helping them get up to speed with company policies and procedures, and collecting onboarding documents. Training For employees to be effective in their roles, it’s important to provide them with the necessary training. This can include on-the-job training, online courses, or even attending workshops or conferences. Managing performance It’s essential to regularly review an employee's performance and provide feedback so they can continue to improve their work output. This may involve setting goals and targets, providing coaching and mentoring, or issuing warnings or sanctions if needed. Benefits A key part of retaining employees is offering competitive benefits and retirement packages. This may include things like health insurance, pension plans, paid vacation days, or tuition reimbursement programs. Payroll Managing pay is a similar but distinct element to benefits. This includes issuing payments on time, calculating taxes and deductions, and keeping track of employee hours worked. Employee relations Maintaining positive employee relations is essential for keeping morale high and preventing turnover. This can be achieved through a variety of methods, such as regular communication , social events, or providing support during difficult times. Compliance It’s important to ensure that all employees are compliant with company policies and procedures, as well as any applicable laws and regulations. This may involve conducting audits or investigations, issuing warnings or sanctions, or providing training on compliance-related topics. Time and attendance Tracking employee time and attendance is important for a few reasons, such as managing payroll or identifying areas where employees may be slacking off. This can be done through manual methods, such as timecards or sign-in sheets, or by using an automated time and attendance system. What is the difference between human capital management and human resource management? While many make the mistake of using these terms as synonyms, the reality is that there are distinctions between the two. Human resource management , or HRM, primarily focuses on managing the administrative functions of an organization’s workforce. This includes recruitment, onboarding, employee relations, payroll, benefits administration, compliance with labor laws, and performance management. HRM is centered on the operational aspects of managing people within an organization. Human capital management, on the other hand, takes a broader, more strategic approach. It encompasses all HRM functions but also includes talent management, workforce planning, learning and development, and succession planning. HCM emphasizes optimizing the value of employees as assets (or “capital”) to drive organizational success, viewing employees not just as resources but as key contributors to the company’s long-term growth and competitive advantage. Why is HCM important? HCM provides an all-encompassing approach that can benefit your business in several ways. Firstly, it helps businesses to attract and retain the best people. By implementing an HCM solution, businesses can identify and hire the most talented individuals who fit with their organizational culture. Secondly, HCM can help businesses improve employee productivity. By providing employees with the necessary training and tools, businesses can ensure they are able to perform to their full potential. Finally, HCM can help businesses reduce costs associated with employee turnover. As a strategy, HCM brings all these ideas together in a highly integrated manner. A human capital management strategy will keep things organized and efficient and ultimately save time and money. What is HCM software? The workplace has never been as dynamic or fast-paced as it is today, and organizations are under increasing pressure to do more with less. Human capital management software helps businesses manage their workforce more effectively and efficiently. HCM software solutions are designed to automate and streamline the process of managing an organization's human capital. This includes activities such as recruiting, onboarding, training, and performance management. By automating these processes, businesses can save time and resources that can be better spent on other areas of the business. Recruiting The recruiting process is the beginning of the employee lifecycle, and it’s critical that businesses get it right. HCM software can automate the process of recruiting by helping businesses identify and hire the most qualified individuals who fit their organizational culture. HCM software can also automate the process of applicant tracking. This includes tracking applicants through the entire recruitment process from the initial application to the offer stage. This helps businesses keep track of all applicants and make better decisions about who to hire. Onboarding Onboarding is the process of welcoming new employees into an organization and providing them with the necessary training and tools to be productive. HCM software can automate the onboarding process by creating custom onboarding plans for each employee. This includes collecting documents like I-9s, assigning tasks, and sending welcome packets. By automating these tasks, businesses can ensure that new employees are properly onboarded and ready to start working as soon as possible. Training Businesses need to provide employees with the necessary training to be productive. HCM software can automate the training process by creating custom training plans for each employee. This includes sending reminder emails, tracking employee progress, and generating reports on employee performance. By automating these tasks, businesses can ensure that employees are properly trained and able to work productively from day one. Performance management Performance management is a key component of human capital management. HCM software can automate the performance management process by creating custom performance reviews for each employee. This includes setting goals, tracking progress, and generating reports on employee performance. By automating these tasks, businesses can ensure employees are meeting their performance goals and are able to improve their performance over time. Benefits of HCM solutions The best human capital management software has a plethora of benefits. Here are just some of the benefits your business could reap by implementing HCM software: Make data-driven solutions You no longer need to rely on gut instinct when making decisions about your workforce. HCM software provides you with the data and analytics you need to make informed decisions about your employees. This data can be used to improve the performance of your workforce and make better decisions about things like training and development. Reduce time and resources spent on HR By automating the process of managing your workforce, HCM software can save you a significant amount of time and resources, allowing you to focus on other areas of your business. Improved employee engagement When employees are properly managed and developed, they’re more engaged with their work. This leads to improved performance and productivity. Reduce employee turnover When employees are properly managed and developed, they are less likely to leave the organization. This helps to reduce the costs associated with employee turnover. Increase profitability By eliminating waste and improving the performance of your workforce, HCM software can help you increase your profitability. Improved customer satisfaction Happy employees lead to improved customer satisfaction. When your employees are properly managed and developed, they are more likely to be satisfied with their work and provide better service to your customers. Challenges of HCM While there are many benefits to implementing an HCM solution, there are also some challenges that businesses need to be aware of. Data security HCM solutions store a lot of sensitive employee data, including personal information, financial information, and health records. Businesses must choose an HCM solution that is built on a secure platform and has strong data security measures in place. Data accuracy HCM solutions need to be able to accurately track employee data. This includes things like job titles, salary history, performance reviews, and training records. If the data in an HCM solution is inaccurate, it can lead to problems with decision-making, compliance, and employee morale. User adoption HCM solutions can be complex, and it can be difficult for employees to use all the features. Businesses must choose an HCM solution that’s easy to use and has a robust training and support infrastructure in place. Human capital management in the cloud There has been a wholesale shift towards cloud-based software, and HCM solutions are no exception. Cloud-based HCM solutions offer a number of benefits compared to traditional on-premise solutions. Some of the main benefits of cloud-based HCM solutions include: Reduced costs Cloud-based HCM solutions are typically more cost effective than traditional on-premise solutions. This is because businesses don’t need to invest in the hardware and software required to run the solution. Increased flexibility Cloud-based HCM solutions offer businesses increased flexibility as they can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. This is particularly beneficial for businesses with employees who work in different locations. Scalability Cloud-based HCM solutions are highly scalable and can be easily adjusted to meet the changing needs of businesses. This contrasts with traditional on-premise solutions, which can be difficult and expensive to scale. Improved security Cloud-based HCM solutions offer businesses improved security as they are typically hosted by experienced providers who have invested heavily in security infrastructure. The future of HCM Human capital management has evolved a great deal since its 20th-century roots. As the workplace changes, so too does the need to evolve the way this new workforce is managed. Here are some of the ways we can expect HCM to evolve in the future: Mobile To truly engage modern workers, HR needs to take a mobile-first approach. This means that HCM solutions need to be accessible on the go via mobile devices. Predictive analytics The use of data and analytics will become increasingly important in the world of HCM. By using predictive analytics, businesses will be able to identify issues and trends before they become problems. This will allow HR leaders to take a proactive approach to employee management and avoid potential crises. Artificial intelligence The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is also likely to increase in the world of HCM. AI can be used for a variety of tasks such as identifying training and development needs, predicting employee turnover, and automating HR processes. But AI will also be important on a more rudimentary level. Things like chatbots will become ever more popular to service a much faster-paced work environment. In a world where we're always 'on,' it's important to have solutions that can keep up . Social Finally, businesses need to recognize that the digital world largely exists on social platforms. Embracing this change can allow for better engagement between workers and the company while also allowing easier lines of communication between employees. Summary Human capital management is all about getting the most out of your employees. Businesses that implement a clear HCM strategy can expect to see several benefits, such as improved employee engagement, increased productivity, and reduced turnover. Just remember that, like the workforce itself, HCM always needs to evolve to ensure that it's relevant and effective.

It allows them to manage the recruitment process more efficiently and effectively. In this guide, we’ll provide a comprehensive overview of what an ATS is and how it can be used to streamline the hiring process. We’ll also discuss some of the key features you should look for when choosing an ATS. So, if you’re looking to improve your recruitment process, read on! What is an applicant tracking system? An applicant tracking system is an application that helps businesses manage the recruitment process. It’s designed to streamline how companies collect, sort, and track job applications. An ATS can be used to track all aspects of the recruitment process, from initial job postings to final applicant selections. How do applicant tracking systems work? There is no singular ATS that all businesses use. Applicant tracking systems work in different ways depending on the specific software. However, most applicant tracking systems share some common features and functions. These common features include: Data storage Perhaps the most foundational function of an ATS is the storage of applicant information. ATS software is designed to collect and organize applicant data. This data can include everything from contact information, work history, resumes, and cover letters. Applicant tracking systems typically allow employers to search this data using keywords or other criteria. This makes it easier to find qualified applicants when needed. Screening Being able to screen potential applicants effectively is vital when handling large numbers of applications, which means it's important that your applicant tracking system has robust screening capabilities . These features should include: Smart-screening questions Smart-screening questions are mandatory questions within your application that enable you to automatically reject unqualified applicants. Eligibility parameters Eligibility parameters help you identify applicants who meet the minimum requirements for the position, such as \"years of experience\" or \"education level.\" Skill testing Some applicant tracking systems have built-in tests that allow you to assess an applicant’s skills and abilities. These can be helpful for positions that require specific technical skills. Resume-ranking functionality Another vital function that you can expect from your ATS is the ability to rank resumes. Applicants who have applied for a job through an ATS will have their resumes automatically stored in the system. This software will then use predetermined criteria to rank each resume. This criteria can be based on how well the resume stacks up to the job description and requirements. The ATS will also consider things like the applicant's work experience, education, and skills. By ranking resumes, the ATS can help you quickly identify the most qualified applicants for a job. This is a huge time saver as you no longer have to review each and every resume that comes in manually. Reporting Any decent ATS software should provide you with some basic reporting functionality . This includes things like the ability to track how many resumes have been received, how many candidates have been contacted, and how many interviews have been scheduled. This information can be extremely valuable, as it can help you gauge the effectiveness of your recruiting efforts. For example, if you're not receiving many qualified resumes, you may need to adjust your job postings. Or, if you're finding that most applicants are rejected after the first interview, you may want to reconsider your interviewing process. Automation Finally, you can expect your ATS to automate some of the more tedious and time-consuming aspects of recruiting. This can include everything from posting job openings on your website to sending automatic email responses to applicants. By automating these tasks, your ATS can save you a considerable amount of time and effort. This allows you to focus on more important things, like meeting with applicants and making hiring decisions. What are the benefits of using an ATS? Employers and recruiters have been utilizing ATS for years. The best applicant tracking systems have several key benefits: Time-saving Perhaps the main advantage of using an ATS is that it can save you a considerable amount of time and effort. By automating repetitive tasks, an ATS can free up your time so you can focus on more important things like meeting with applicants and making hiring decisions. Improved organization Another benefit of using an ATS is that it can help you better organize your recruitment process. An ATS can store all your applicant information in one centralized location, which makes it easy to keep track of things. Additionally, an ATS can automate things like job postings and email responses, which can help improve how you organize your hiring efforts. Higher quality hires Because an ATS can rank resumes and track applicant information, it can help you identify the best candidates for a job. This, in turn, can lead to higher-quality hires. Increased applicant engagement Finding great applicants isn't worth much if you can't get them to apply for your open positions. However, an ATS can help with this by automatically posting your job openings to multiple job boards and websites. This helps increase the visibility of your open positions and, as a result, can lead to increased applicant engagement. Keep up with the competition An applicant tracking system is almost mandatory if you want to keep up with the competition. This is because more and more employers are using an ATS to streamline their recruitment process. Failure to use an ATS will mean you'll likely be at a disadvantage when competing for top talent, and it can close you off from great hiring opportunities. Improved efficiency One of the main goals of using an applicant tracking system is to improve the efficiency of your recruitment process. An ATS can help you achieve this by automating repetitive tasks and storing applicant information in one centralized location. This makes it easy to find the information you need when you need it, which can save you a lot of time and effort. Reduced costs Finally, you can expect to see a reduction in costs when using an applicant tracking system. As you improve efficiency and cut out much of the unnecessary busy work, you free up time and money that can be spent on more important things like training your staff. What are the features of an ATS? When it comes to applicant tracking systems, there is a wide range of features you can expect , including: Resume screening A feature you can expect with just about any ATS is the ability to screen resumes. This will allow you to filter out resumes that don't match the criteria you need. This filter may be done based on the job description or other screening factors like smart-screening questions . Why this matters: When advertising a role, it's very possible to receive dozens, if not hundreds, of applications. Going through each application manually would be hugely time-consuming. Applicant tracking systems give you the ability to screen resumes quickly and easily. Removing applications that aren't a good match right away means you can focus your time on the most qualified applicants. Keywords A keyword feature allows you to parse through resumes and identify which ones contain the keywords you're looking for. These features also allow you to use negative keywords to avoid looking at resumes that include a keyword you aren't interested in. Why this matters: Many applicant tracking systems now use some form of artificial intelligence (AI) to help screen resumes. However, these systems are still only as good as the keywords you input. This means that it's still important for you to carefully consider the keywords you're using. You'll want to use both positive and negative keywords to make sure you're getting the most accurate results possible. Filters A filtering feature lets you narrow down the pool of applicants by specifying certain criteria. For example, you may want to only look at applicants who can work and live within a certain radius of the job location. Why this matters: The filtering feature is one of the most powerful features offered by applicant tracking systems. It's great for categorizing types of applications, as well as finding the very best match for a job opening. Automated emails One feature that applicant tracking systems offer is the ability to automate email communications. This means you can set up automatic responses after you receive a resume, when an applicant moves to the next stage of the process, and so on. Why this matters: Automated email communications can help keep your applicants updated on the status of their applications as well as the next steps they should expect. This can be a great way to improve communication and keep your applicants informed throughout the process. Advanced analytics Some applicant tracking systems also offer advanced analytics features . This can include things like being able to see what sources your best applicants are coming from or predicting how long it will take to fill a role. Why this matters: Advanced analytics can be a helpful way to get insights into your recruiting process. This information can be used to improve your process as well as make more informed decisions about your hiring. CRM software Many applicant tracking systems have CRM (customer relationship management) software built in. This allows you to engage your potential applicants directly via the system rather than needing to rely on external tools like email. Why this matters: CRM software can be a great way to keep track of your potential applicants and engage with them directly. This can help you build relationships, keep your applicants interested in the role, and ensure communication lines never fall through the cracks. The last thing you want is to miss out on a great applicant because you forgot to respond to an email. Applicant pool sourcing An applicant pool sourcing feature allows you to retain information and data from potential candidates even if they don't get offered the role for which they originally applied. This allows you to grow your applicant pool and contact individuals for future roles that may be a better match. Why this matters: Not every good applicant will get the job. But that doesn’t mean you can’t hire them later for a different role. Applicant sourcing features allow you to build a pool of potentially great candidates who may be perfect for an upcoming position. These tools are also built with compliance in mind since data storage is a sensitive issue. Integrations The best ATS should be able to integrate with your existing HR software. This allows you to have all your applicant data in one place and makes it easy to keep track of. Why this matters: Having a system that can integrate with your other HR software is important for keeping all of your applicant data in one place. This can make it easier to keep track of and ensure that you're not duplicating data entry. Onboarding Finally, many applicant tracking systems offer an onboarding feature. This means you can use the system to help new hires get acclimated to their new role and company. This can include things like collecting new hire paperwork, setting up training programs, or sending out welcome emails. Why this matters: Onboarding is an important part of the recruiting process and can help ensure new hires are successful in their roles. Having a system that can help with this can be a great way to improve your onboarding process. Drawbacks of using an ATS While ATS software is a fantastic tool to help recruiters and employers bring in talent, there are a few potential drawbacks to using applicant tracking systems. Cost The cost of the software, as well as the subscription fees, can add up quickly. Additionally, applicant tracking systems can require a significant time and resource investment to set up and maintain. Complexity Applicant tracking systems can be complex and require a certain level of technical expertise to set up and use. This can make it difficult for small businesses and startups to get started using applicant tracking systems. Inaccurate results Algorithms are not perfect. When your applicant tracking system uses a less reliable algorithm to select applicants, you may mistake a well-qualified candidate for a less qualified one. This can lead to good applicants slipping through the cracks and a potentially bad candidate experience . Lack of human touch Because ATS programs are automated, they lack the human touch that is so important in the hiring process. This can lead to a feeling of disconnection between applicants and employers. This could also lead applicants to feel disconnected from your business. Similarly, you may end up with an applicant who is good on paper but clashes with the ethos and culture of your company. ATSs are becoming more and more commonplace in the recruiting landscape. However, it's important to be aware of the potential drawbacks of using applicant tracking systems before deciding whether to use one or not. How accurate are applicant tracking systems? As it stands, ATSs are very accurate when you account for just how much data they work through. They can help narrow down an applicant pool to a manageable list of qualified candidates in a relatively short amount of time. However, there are a couple of caveats. Firstly, they struggle to differentiate between similar candidates. This is because ATSs are automated systems that rely on algorithms to sort and select candidates. These algorithms are not perfect and can sometimes make mistakes. This can lead to good applicants being overlooked or even rejected outright. Secondly, ATSs are not human and cannot replace the personal touch that is so important in recruiting. They can help narrow down an applicant pool and save time, but they should not be used as a replacement for human interaction. They cannot interview applicants, nor can they assess competence or character. Finally, the results you get are only as good as the data you input. This means that applicant tracking systems can only be as accurate as the information you give them. If there are errors in your data, the applicant tracking system will make errors in its assessment. For these reasons, it's important to use applicant tracking systems as one part of your recruiting process. They can be valuable tools, but they should not be the only tool you use. Applicant tracking systems should be used in conjunction with other methods, such as personal networking, referrals, and job boards. How to ensure success when implementing an ATS As it should now be clear, there are enormous benefits to using applicant tracking systems as long as you set yourself up for success. Recognize why you need an ATS What is the exact problem you need to solve? Success will come when the applicant tracking system complements your current recruitment strategy. Trying to fix what isn't broken will only lead to frustration. Get buy-in from all stakeholders An applicant tracking system can only be as successful as the people using it. This means that you'll need to get buy-in from everyone who will be using the system. This includes managers, recruiters, and even the IT team. Have a plan for data migration An applicant tracking system will only be as good as the data you put into it. This means you'll need to have a plan for migrating your data into the system. This can be a time-consuming process, but it's essential for success. Summary Incorporating an applicant tracking system can be the difference between a successful hiring process and a frustrating one. It can save you time and money while also improving the quality of your hires.

It demands dependability, otherwise you risk disrupting the lives of your team. But there are four other key components to modern payroll solutions that can save both time and money-but most quick-service restaurants don't know what they are! We invited Kerri Swope, Chief Customer Officer of payroll service Check, to share the five things your payroll provider should include, and why yours might be falling short! Transcript Daniel (00:00): Hello everyone, my name is Daniel. I'm with Workstream, and it's my pleasure to be here today with Kerri Swope. Kerri is the Chief Customer Officer at Check, and we're going to talk all about the four pillars of a modern payroll provider. Now, a lot of people think, uh, payroll isn't maybe modern or it's just kind of something they, they have to use. Uh, we're gonna talk about why that's not the case and why There are actually four different things that you should look for and you should definitely try to have when you're choosing a payroll solution. Uh, now Kerri, thanks for being here. It's great to chat with you. Kerri (00:35): Yeah, thanks so much for having me, Daniel. Daniel (00:37): Now to kick things off, you know, I introduced you as Chief Customer Officer at Check. Um, I'd love to hear a little bit more about your background experience and why you are qualified to speak on this topic today. Kerri (00:50): Yeah, of course, of course. Um, so, uh, as you mentioned, I am, uh, currently our Chief cos, uh, customer officer here at Check have been with check for almost a year now, but I have over 20 years of experience. So the bulk of my entire professional career has been in payroll and tax, and I've worked at some of the top payroll providers across the United States, including specialized providers in certain nuanced industries like care.com, HomePay, who focused on household employment specifically, um, and then also larger, uh, payroll provider platforms like Gusto. Daniel (01:27): Awesome. Lot of great experience. I'm excited to, uh, jump into some of that experience and, uh, I'm sure everyone watching this is as well. Um, now I kind of mentioned this, but I feel like a lot of the customers that I've spoken with, uh, at Workstream, they kind of see payroll almost as like a necessary evil. Uh, why do you think that that's kind of a, a common perception? Kerri (01:49): Yeah, no, you're absolutely right. Um, payroll really is a commodity and often viewed as a vendor relationship, very transactional in nature. And largely I think that kind of perception about payroll companies is because most have remained relatively stagnant in terms of innovation over the past several Devi, uh, decades. And so some of your more well-known payroll service providers really have origins. They were, you know, came into fruition pre-internet era oftentimes. Um, and so they've primarily really focused on their, um, innovation efforts on adding superficial functionalities without really adapting their platforms to the evolving needs of modern businesses. Uh, for context, some of our, the most popular payroll providers, their NPS score or their net promoter score, customer satisfaction is a negative eight. Um, <laugh>, so not great. Um, and 74% of employers would actually switch their payroll providers if they felt they can move to an all-in-one solution that met all of their business needs or more of their business needs offered a better product, a better customer experience, um, if they thought that platform actually could do those, you know, those things for them and meet their need, the unique needs of their business. So, um, it really is kind of that perception amongst many employers and businesses that payroll is just play payroll, it's a commodity, it's a transaction, and it's a necessary evil, unfortunately. Daniel (03:18): Yeah, very interesting stats that you called out. And so it seems like it's fair to say a lot of businesses are, they're willing to change if they could find something better, but maybe they feel like, well, can I even find something better? It might as well, right? Stick with the thing that I know works even if, uh, if I'm not very happy with it. Um, Kerri (03:38): Exactly, Daniel (03:38): Exactly. Yeah. Interesting. Um, so we kind of framed this all around the four pillars of modern payroll when we kinda, you know, emphasize that word modern. What would you say is a, the distinction between modern payroll and more legacy payroll? Kerri (03:56): Yeah, great question, Daniel. So when I think of traditional payroll providers, some of those that I have had the opportunity to work at, typically you think of a offering a one size fits all approach. Um, they're more of a generalist platform and solution. They lack customization to really address the specific requirements of a business like a restaurant or a franchise owner, for example. Um, they often are operating in silos, um, and so they require a business owner to have multiple costly platforms, disconnected software systems to really manage the various aspects of their business. So one system for recording payroll hours, one system for actually moving money, for example, another system for filing the taxes. Um, so it all results in really a cumbersome, outdated, and often very manual time consuming solution. Um, consuming a lot of valuable time for, you know, a a, a business owner on a day-to-day basis. (04:56): Whereas when I think of a modern payroll solution, um, something like workstream for example, it really is tailored for a specific industry and that industry's needs. So whether that's construction or household employment like care.com, HomePay, where I previously worked, or the restaurant industry, um, or serving small and medium sized businesses instead of large enterprise corporate America. So it really, you know, modern payroll is more tailored, more customized to the unique industries it serves in the businesses. Within those, it's also more integrated. So your payroll provider and with modern payroll really is gonna be operating as more in the same platform where you manage a lot of the other aspects of your business so that it is, you know, one platform talking to another platform and reducing duplicate data entry needs. So you're not having to put information in multiple systems, you're not having to pay for multiple systems. (05:51): You can really operate your business all in one place. Um, and then lastly, I would say like modern payroll really is simple. It's adaptable. It's not over-engineered. It's, you know, intuitive and seamless, which allows you to minimize time spent managing payroll and your tax compliance needs for your business. It minimizes errors, um, and really minimizes that need for like an extensive payroll tax, HR expertise and background. Um, if a, if you're using a modern payroll platform, it should be simple and easy to use and not require, you know, decades of experience like myself in payroll and tax to be able to operate and run your business. Daniel (06:28): Yeah, uh, a lot of good context there. I think it's fair to say, kind of what you said, modern payroll, it seems like it's, uh, it's not one size fits all. It's a more, you know, maybe a more custom tailored solution. It's more, uh, smart, a little more efficient, kind of some of those things. Um, so anyway, I'm excited. As we walk through some of these other questions, I think we'll kind of touch on specific examples of what that means, right? Something that's more efficient or smart or whatever. Okay, well what does that actually look like for someone watching this? What does this look like for my business? Um, so exactly. Cool, cool. Yeah. Alright. Um, well, let's start off with pillar number one of modern payroll. Um, and we've de decided that that first pillar should be great customer support. Uh, now every payroll provider and pretty much every software company in the world says we offer great customer support. Um, but when we say that, what does that actually mean? What do you think about that, Kerri? Kerri (07:31): Yeah, Daniel. Um, it's something I've built my entire career on and having an entire career of multiple decades in the industry of working on payroll and tax, it just really isn't an industry known for great customer support, unfortunately. Um, back to the point I was making earlier, the, you know, net promoter score in the industry is on average negative eight. So really telling, um, so when I think of what great support means, it really is a combination of having business context and subject matter expertise for the unique needs of the business. So from a business context, your payroll provider should special specialize in your industry. They should understand the specific needs of QSRs franchise structures, how that translates to multiple locations when you're running payroll, and do all of those things without causing disruptions to your business. You know, things like adding a location or modifying your employee pay because of different shifts, for example, should really be handled seamlessly by experts in your industry, which help you avoid delays, make sure your workers are getting paid on time, make sure your, um, employees are getting paid accurately, um, and that you're getting the support that you need from your payroll provider when you need it. (08:46): Um, you know, many payroll providers are generalists, as I mentioned earlier. They lack that expertise in specific industries. They're trying to have that one fits all approach, um, do the, you know, their wide market spread, and so they aren't able to actually provide that great subject matter expertise and that great business context to what you need. I'll give you a perfect example. At top payroll providers, the average tenure of one of their payroll support specialists is about 11 months. Um, it's a highly turnover attrition industry. However, at workstream, your specialists are, you know, an average of 11 years, not 11 months. So they really are able to demonstrate and bring that unparalleled expertise, their dedication to the field, to the industry that you serve. Um, and with that understanding and expertise, um, they're really able to solve a lot of the complexities that come with payroll in the industry, um, and are equipped to really handle those challenges versus a, like I said, one size fits all solution. (09:49): Um, I'll give you a a perfect example that just came up recently. Um, workstream recently assisted an employer. Um, they came from a prior provider switched to workstream to start handling work, uh, payroll through workstream. And the prior provider was not a specialist in the industry. And so they had incorrectly withhold withheld Social security and Medicare on, um, three different employees. They were students, so they were working as temporary workers during the summer months in between school semesters. And because of that, because of their age, their temporary employment status, the industry that they're working in, um, those students aren't special, aren't subject to certain taxes like social security, Medicare, for example. And so the prior provider not being an expert in this space, didn't handle it correctly. They withheld taxes from the employee, so the employee's not getting paid what they are owed. Um, oftentimes in this industry, you know, we're living paycheck to paycheck, that's really important. (10:44): Every dollar matters. And on top of that, the employer's paying more in taxes than they should. And as a small business franchise owner, also very important, every dollar matters. And so workstream was able to fix that, correct the information, and make sure the taxes are being withheld properly going forward, because Workstream has that expertise. They've been in the industry for, you know, over a decade, um, with the support team and the support team member was able to like, catch this right off the bat and fix it. So, um, that's just not the type of experience you're gonna get at every payroll provider, but the type of experience, what I consider really great customer support. Daniel (11:20): Yeah, it's such a, you know, it's such a relatable example because it's one of those things where, you know, payroll goes wrong like that someone's paid a little bit less than they're supposed to, like you said, the business owner, there's implications there, um, that can really derail, uh, an employer employee relationship maybe forever, right? Like a hundred percent. There might not be any going, any, uh, ability to go come back from that. Um, so that makes sense. I like that you called out, I, you know, I wrote down the, the understanding of the unique needs and challenges, uh, of your business is really important. And I think your example definitely speaks to that perfectly. Um, one thing that I wanted to ask specifically about when it come comes to customer support is, I've heard from different customers, um, that the, the process of switching payroll is maybe like one of the top most stressful things you can do as a business owner. Um, why is this specific time so important to have great customer support? Kerri (12:25): Yeah, uh, you're, you're absolutely right, Daniel. Um, I've, I've, I've done this work myself in my career. So I've hands-on keyboard actually helped employers switch payroll providers. And it, it absolutely is, um, a, a mission critical time for a business because you are dealing with people's money. You know, at the end of the day, a lot of employees rely on that paycheck to be accurate and timely, um, on a consistent paycheck to paycheck basis. And so when you're working, you know, in such a mission critical field like people's livelihoods are on the line sometimes, um, it's, it's really important to get it right and for it to be a smooth, smooth process. And legacy payroll providers really have lagged behind in innovation in this area, um, despite some attempts. Um, the reality is, is that, as you know, a payroll provider, you have a vested interest in making switching difficult and costly. (13:18): You know, if, if I believe as a consumer, as an employer, there isn't really a better solution out there, and you've made it really difficult for me to switch, switch, I'm gonna kind of just put up with subpar customer support, um, because of those two things. And so, you know, the prospect of that uncertainty as, and the associated time to actually switch and the effort required by a business tube move, all of that information from one software platform to another just outweighs the perceived benefits that might come with it. So in order to, um, you know, minimize that stressful moment in time as a business owner so that the business owner can ensure those employees are continuing to be paid timely, when they do switch, you have to really make it easy for them. So, you know, whereas for many payroll platforms, it can be anywhere from four to six weeks for a pretty straightforward switch. (14:11): Um, a couple employees, one location, maybe a few payrolls have been run in the year. It can be anywhere to multiple months for more complex businesses with several employees or lots of franchises, for example, um, to, to switch software, um, on top of just running your day-to-Day business, <laugh>. So, you know, it's, it's working with people's money, it's time consuming for the employer. So it really needs to be a seamless process, and that's where that customer support really comes into play. Daniel, you know, if, if I'm going to spend the time and energy, I wanna make sure someone's there to hold my, when I have questions and ideally take the work off of my plate altogether, which, you know, if you're switching to workstream payroll is exactly that. It's not a multi-month error prone endeavor. You know, workstream has built a modern tooling, uh, whereas a lot of other payroll providers haven't, um, done that successfully to enable companies to seamlessly migrate that historical wage data over from one platform to the other, um, and be hands off in the process for the most part. And as I mentioned, workstream has those experts on hand when questions do come up to be able to answer. Daniel (15:26): Yeah. Yeah, that, uh, a lot of good information. Um, I wanted to ask you, I, I kind of touched on this before, um, but every company says they offer great customer support. You go on there, there's some landing page, right? We, our support is great. Um, and then, you know, when you're asking, uh, a sales rep, of course they're gonna say, yeah, we, we have awesome customer support. Okay, so everyone says that. What are some specific questions that a business owner, um, can ask as they're kind of going through the vetting process to kind of weed through, okay, do they actually offer the great customer support or is this just kind of a, a facade? Kerri (16:08): Yeah, yeah. Um, you're absolutely right. Sales tactics 1 0 1, yes, we have amazing customer support. Um, so the types of questions I would be asking, um, if I were an employer considering switching to a new payroll provider or an, you know, a brand new business owner who is looking for my first payroll provider are things around, you know, is my support question gonna be triaged by an actual human? Is someone a, is there an actual human on the other end of the phone or on the other end of this email who's gonna be assisting me? Or is it, you know, ai, for example? Um, how long should I expect your support team to take to answer my question or resolve my issue? For example, I might as a business owner get a really scary tax letter from the IRS and not have any idea why I'm getting it, how to resolve it, what it means, and it could impact the success of my business potentially, or cost me lots of dollars in penalties and fines if I don't resolve it quickly. (17:06): And so, you know, how long is the payroll provider typically take to resolve something like that? Um, you know, when should I expect their team to be online able to support me? As we've talked about money movement, mission critical part of being in the payroll business and being a business employer, you wanna make sure your employees are getting paid on time. You wanna make sure they're being paid accurately. And if a question comes up or an issue inevitably comes up, it's part of the nature of the business, is your support team gonna be there to be able to help me at 7:00 PM on a Thursday to make sure that that bank money movement transaction happens when it's supposed to happen, and that my employee's gonna get paid on Friday, um, for example. Or does your team shut down at 5:00 PM and you know, I'm left my own devices and trying to figure out how I'm gonna get my worker paid, or I might actually lose that employee altogether because they are living paycheck to paycheck and I can't pay them reliably. (18:00): Um, also like what channels? Payroll is complicated. Sometimes, uh, you know, email exchange is not the most efficient way for a business owner to get their question asked. Oftentimes they don't even know which, you know, what questions to ask. Do you offer phone support? Are you willing as a payroll provider to hop on the phone with me if I have a question and I need some extra handholding? Or you, do you only offer, you know, email support? Do you offer chat or text, for example? So those are some of the things I, I, I like to ask or like, you know, to, to recommend to a business owner when they're considering a payroll provider solution. Um, and then I think the other one is really, you know, do they specialize in this industry? Do they have deep subject matter expertise like the work stream does on this specific nuanced, complex industry that has its own set of regulations and compliance laws to adhere to, um, so that they really are gonna be able to have that business context and subject matter expertise? Or does your team have any background whatsoever supporting customers in this business? So Daniel (19:03): Yeah, those are some great recommendations. Um, I love that you call that, especially like the availability of support, because I feel like may, it's, it's can't just be me no matter what I need help with whatever platform, like Amazon, whatever it, I feel like every single time something goes wrong, it's like one hour after the support has closed for the day, like every single time inevitably. Yes. It just feels that way. So, uh, anyway, that, that one spoke to me, uh, specifically <laugh>. Um, so let's move on to pillar number two that we've identified, uh, uh, from modern payroll. Um, and that is compliance friendliness. So just to recap, number one, uh, was customer support number two is compliance friendly. Uh, can you give us an idea of what sort of compliance issues, uh, might be especially costly for a quick service restaurant or another business that employs a lot of hourly workers? Kerri (19:59): Yeah, absolutely. Running a business with hourly workers, regardless of the industry is hard enough. Um, but then you add the complexity of trying to keep up with the myriad of laws and regulations. Every state is different. Every, you know, county or city can potentially be different. Um, so it just adds a layer of complexity to being a business owner, um, that your payroll provider really should be able to support you as an employer business owner and take that burden off your plate. So, um, you know, one of the things, especially in the quick service business for example, that we see come up a lot or that I've seen come up, come up a lot, is around the type of workers that they tend to employ. So employees are hourly, so they are, um, non-exempt workers, which means they're subject to overtime or double pay if they're working on certain dates. (20:52): Every jurisdiction is different. Every state is different in terms of their overtime laws. So it's not just the IRS that you have to comply with, but you also have to comply with California state local overtime laws, for example. Um, they're often shift workers. So typically, you know, I am working special hours on an evening shift or a weekend shift, and that comes with its own set of regulations that a business owner has to comply with. Um, or I'm oftentimes working different jobs. One day during the week I might be, um, on dish washing, the next day I might be working the front service counter. And so that also also requires pay, potentially different pay rates. So multiple pay rates in a single pay period. I might be working at multiple locations. And so working for, you know, this particular location one day and then the next day working at this location, all of those types of things, especially in this particular industry, come with a set of rules and regulations and compliance, um, laws that you have to and adhere to. And when you don't, that comes with a cost of penalties and interest that can be really costly to an employer. In addition, it just reduces employee satisfaction if they're not being paid appropriately for the type of work that they're doing. And so, high turnover rates can happen, loss of job satisfaction and engagement. And you've spent as a business owner all this time training and onboarding this new hire, finding the new hire and recruiting them in the first place only to then lose them because your payroll provider wasn't there to help you stay compliant. Daniel (22:25): Yeah, definitely a lot of, uh, a lot of complexity like you mentioned. I was thinking in your, with your example of, uh, you know, maybe you have a worker that splits time between two different locations if, you know, if you own a, a franchise, uh, restaurant, you know, with two different locations, maybe those locations are in different counties or different, even different states right next to each other, you know, you can just see how, how quickly things can get so complex. So, uh, yes. Yeah, definitely some, uh, some examples that really kind of illustrate that. Um, so with all of the complexity and kind of the risk that comes with compliance, what are some ways that a payroll platform can kind of reassure business owners to feel a little bit more confident? That's like, you know, my, my payroll solution has my back. I, I don't need to be reading up on the latest in, uh, labor laws and, you know, all the different regulations that apply to me. Kerri (23:22): Yeah, yeah, definitely. As I mentioned earlier, you know, you should be able to, as a business owner rely on your payroll provider to help ensure you're compliant, which is also why it's so important that when you are vetting payroll providers, you make sure they have that expertise and specialize in your specific industry. So if I'm a quick service restaurant, making sure my payroll provider really knows the laws and associated with that industry, 'cause every industry is different. So, you know, your payroll provider really should be guiding you through are your workers independent contractors, are they employees? And what does that mean for you as a business owner in terms of the types of things that you have to do to comply with? Do you know, do you have to do I nine verification to make sure they're eligible to work in the United States? Um, are they assisting you with new hire reporting? (24:09): 'cause every tax agency when you hire a new employee requires you to report them for unemployment sur purposes. Um, and if they're going above and beyond, are they assisting you with risk mitigation and management, um, by employing various automated checks for fraud? Are they as a payroll provider helping you as a business owner mitigate any fraud risks, for example, which can be very costly if something like that happens. Um, you know, some providers even assist with, um, assist business owners with tax account management. Like, are you getting my unemployment rate from directly from the tax agency every year for me, or do I need to keep up with that? Also, very expensive, can result in penalties and interest if my tax rate has changed year to year and I didn't realize it because I'm not as a business owner, you know, I own a Burger King, I may not know that Texas, for example, changes my unemployment rate in July instead of the start of a calendar year in January. Um, and may not realize that it changed mid-year and that I have been underpay. So, you know, those are the types of things that I would recommend and I often expect a payroll provider to be helping at a minimum, at least guiding and assisting and educating employers on what to look out for, how to stay in compliance and if they're going above and beyond, like I said, even taking that a step further and doing it for them. Daniel (25:29): Yeah, great examples. Um, I guess the next, uh, question that makes sense. I, I asked this about the previous, uh, pillar, but as a business owner is vetting different payroll solutions, um, what are some specific questions that they can ask? I mean, you've kind of touched on some of the, the issues yeah. That you could for formulate questions around, but what would you recommend as far as specific questions? Kerri (25:55): Yeah, specifics are, do you do I nine verification? Will you do complete the new hire reporting? Do you do tax rate exchanges with each of the tax states that I, in tax agencies that I operate within? Um, will you assist me with, um, registering my business if I hire a new employee in a new state for the first time? Um, are you completing fraud checks, uh, to mitigate fraudulent potential activity? Um, will you let me know when the state changes and issues a new W four form? That's a real common one that many of us, you know, I filled out a W four when I first started working for check. I'm not as an employee out there making sure that a new form hasn't come out that I need to now fill out again. Um, and business owners often aren't either. That's, you know, I'm just trying to run a successful business. (26:43): I'm not keeping up with when the IRS or my state provides an updated W four form. Um, so that's a big one that tends to happen. Um, are you gonna let me know when I need to make sure that my bank accounts are funded, um, so that I can make tax, uh, so that you're making tax payments timely and filing timely? Are you going to let me know when I need to make sure that the W2 is to my employee every year end so that the employee can, can file, there's regulations involved with making sure you get that type of information to your workers on time and by certain deadlines. Um, a big one in this particular industry, especially for quick service restaurants or any, um, any business with hourly employers is, will you tell me when I need to pay overtime? Or what paid time off laws are in certain jurisdictions where I might employ workers? It varies both on overtime and paid time off regulations from state to state, city to city, county to county. It's a lot to keep up with. And when it does, even if you do know it now, it may change in the future. How are you supposed to know, like when those things change and when you know you might need to start paying overtime? And so those, those last two especially are huge, um, benefits that a payroll provider should be helping a business under stay in compliance with. Daniel (27:59): Yeah, those are, that's a great list. I feel like I need to, uh, we need to like type this all out and, and share this <laugh> uh, with everyone watching this. 'cause I'm, I feel like it, you know, put that up on your wall. Kerri (28:10): Yeah. I hope I'm not scared anybody off Daniel (28:11): <laugh>? No, no, no, not at all. I, I think this is gonna be very helpful. Um, alright, uh, I think it's time to move to pillar number three of modern payroll. Uh, to recap, number one, uh, was great customer support and number two was compliance friendliness. Um, and I think we determined that number three is user experience. So we already talked about the kind of perception that, uh, you know, payroll providers are, you know, I'll I'll say dinosaurs, uh, not user friendly. Why is a positive user experience so important? Kerri (28:51): Yeah, um, let's take it on two sides of the house is kind of how I think about it. One is as the business owner or the employer, and the other is on the employee side. 'cause it really is, um, needs to be a seamless positive experience for both, um, stakeholders. So on the employer side, think about busy. You are, as an employer, you have a number of obstacles in your way to making sure you're running an efficient, profitable business in an increasingly intensive, complex labor market. Um, with rising costs everywhere right now. So you as an employer don't have time and you don't have the margins to really waste on running payroll, navigating complex nuance, uh, comp, you know, regulations. You have a business to run. So time is of the essence and time is money. And so your time really should be invested in running the day-to-day operations of a successful restaurant, for example, not moving data, um, from one platform to another, double entering data across multiple systems, um, managing errors when they occur. (30:00): You really want a well-designed payroll system that streamline these processes for you, reduces the time that you're spending on these required payroll tasks and frees up very valuable time, um, to focus on other core business activities. It's also important as an employer from a financial exp uh, perspective, payroll involves really complex legal re regulatory requirements. And so a user friendly system, um, will help ensure compliance with the tax laws, like we were just talking about, labor regulations like we were just discussing and reporting requirements which will reduce the risk of errors. And then because of errors, potential penalties that an employer might otherwise have to pay. Um, when we talk about the employee side, the flip side of this, um, some of the features that a, a user-friendly payroll platform should include for the employee perspective really is, especially this generation I'll speak to, to work streams, employers and employers in the quick service business or restaurant industry for example, they expect, you know, workers expect a lot from their employers. (31:03): They have an expectation of a mobile friendly experience. I wanna see my pay stub on my phone, I don't wanna have to log in, I'm busy, I'm on the go, you know, I'm paid hourly. It's important to me. I need to make sure when my paycheck is, is is available. I need to make sure it's accurate. And I got paid for every one of those hours I worked hard for and I wanna be able to see it on my phone. Um, I wanna, if I need to make an update, I need to be able like, hey, I've just, you know, changed jobs, I have multiple jobs, I need to update that W four we were talking about. I need to be able to do that on the fly. Um, I need to know that you, you know, you're gonna support my flexible work arrangements. I work at multiple Burger Kings, multiple smoothie kings, and I need to know that you're gonna help, you know, I can manage my shifts and see my shifts, um, for example. (31:49): So current systems really are prohibitive to a lot of providing an experience like that at scale, um, at most, you know, legacy payroll platforms. And what that means is you could potentially end up losing employees that you invested heavily in as an employer into the hiring and onboarding and training process just to disappoint, disappoint them. 'cause you don't have these types of features that they're expecting and looking for, um, or a payroll experience that, you know, their peers might be benefiting from because they are on workstream payroll. Um, it really is just a fundamental aspect of the employer employee relationship, to be honest, at its core. And so a seamless user-friendly payroll system ensures that those employees are not only paid accurately and on time, so they're, you know, more satisfied, happy employees, but they're also more likely to stay. Daniel (32:36): Yeah, I think as you know in what you were saying, the thing that really stood out to me is like your, your payroll solution that you choose, it's, it ultimately becomes a reflection of your, you as a business owner, right? Like your, your employees. They, they're not necessarily gonna be like, oh, well, you know, it's, it's not my employer's fault that this is such a bad experience. It, they're kind of gonna lump the whole experience in uh, absolutely with their experience as an employee. Um, the other thing that I was thinking of that's kind of interesting is like, uh, you're, when you're vetting a payroll, uh, provider, you're ultimately, it's like, well I'm, I'm choosing someone that my employees are going to interact with maybe more or just as much as any other technology for my business. Um, mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, hiring software, your, your employees, uh, they go through that process. (33:28): They're, they're onboarded and then that's kind of probably it. Um, but yeah, like you said, e every week potentially they're going to, or every day. Yeah. Or every day for some, uh, yeah. For some businesses, uh, they're going to, uh, you know, interact with this solution that you choose in some way. So it's really important to make sure that that is not a bad experience. 'cause it could kind of be a death by a thousand cuts thing, right? Every single time it's like, oh, I have to log in. Oh, it's telling me I have to use my desktop computer or whatever it is. Like that could be, uh, very jarring if you, if you're an employee having to do that over and over again. Kerri (34:04): Exactly. Exactly. Daniel (34:06): Um, alright. Um, so I, you kind of touched on this a little bit, but I wanted to just dial down a little bit more. Um, what, uh, what are some risks that come with an overly complex system? Kerri (34:24): Yeah. Um, it's funny, I, so, uh, leading our operations teams at check, I think about this in a myriad of ways, not just being a payroll platform, um, but also, you know, if I am for my own teams, you know, thinking through like, is it over-engineered? Am I, did, did the product make it harder than it needed to be given the size of the business of check, for example? And so I think payroll providers saying same situation if I'm a small business owner, if I have one franchise, for example, a, a Chick-fil-A and I don't have hundreds, or even if I do have hundreds, how easy is this built for what my needs are as a business owner? So really an overly complicated payroll system, um, that wasn't built to custom needs of, of my, of running the particular business or the particular industry that I'm in can lead to errors in, in accuracy to start. (35:15): So complexity increases the likelihood of those errors in payroll processing, such as incorrect calculations or mis deductions, um, or data entry mistakes. Um, and those errors can lead to compliance issues, financial penalties, and as we were just talking about Daniel, employee dissatisfaction, it also can lead to, you know, a time and resource drain. We talked about that a little bit, um, and hit on that a second ago around, you know, running your business should be your core focus, not running your payroll. Um, running your payroll should be easy. And sometimes these overly complex payroll systems that weren't built for your unique business needs can be draining from a time and resource perspective for both employees and employers. So, um, you know, managing that complex payroll system, it's not streamlined, it's not seamless, it's not integrated with your other systems, requires significant time, requires resources, um, and requires expertise. (36:13): So, you know, I, running a a franchise business, um, quick service restaurant, I probably don't have 20 years of experience running payroll and being an HR expert, um, I have experience running a business. Um, and so I shouldn't have to have that type of experience being an HR payroll tax expert, um, in order to just run my payroll and make sure my employees are getting paid timely. And so in that case, employers oftentimes may spend excessive time troubleshooting issues, um, or reconciling discrepancies or mainly processing payroll tasks because, um, they don't have that expertise and the system's too complicated. Um, and then on the employee side, you know, the employee dissatisfaction, it can lead to payroll errors, delays in employees getting paid, excuse me, or, um, inaccuracies caused by the complexity which can erode employee trust and confidence. As you mentioned, Daniel, as an employee, I don't think of the payroll provider out there. (37:12): If my payroll's not right, I'm going to the business owner, I'm going to my employer and expect and, and going to them and saying, how come you didn't pay me correctly? I'm not going, oh, it's okay. This payroll provider that we used just messed something up, um, or didn't make it easy for me to enter your time properly, for example. And so employees may become frustrated with various payroll issues, which can lead to, to turnover, for example. And then, you know, the last thing I'll just hit on is just the increased cost. Overly complicated payroll systems, they're not built for your business needs. So you often are paying for things you don't need for features you're never going to utilize to run your business on a day-to-day basis, which means you're managing and maintaining a complex payroll system that requires additional investments in software that you're not using, um, training that you may never need, um, and, and support services that really aren't meeting your needs, um, or providing really great service, uh, like we talked about earlier as well. So that can kind of all escalate, add up over time and end up, you know, being very costly for an employer who just needed something simple to run their business. Daniel (38:19): Yeah, there's a, there's definitely a lot at stake. Uh, I think is kind of to summarize, uh, all that you've shared there. Um, alright. I think we've, we've made our way through the first three pillars of modern payroll. Uh, just one time, one more time recap. Uh, number one was customer support. Number two was compliance. Number three, user experience. And number four, I feel like this has been sprinkled throughout, but we wanted to make sure that we called out, uh, the fourth pillar is choosing a provider that's really geared toward your specific industry. It's not just a one size fits all. Um, now once again, you've, you've kind of spoken to this a lot, Kerri, but let's just, you know, really succinctly say why is this something that matters so much? Kerri (39:07): Yeah, yeah. Um, it's a, it's a great final point to make. Um, Daniel is, your payroll provider should not be confused by the type of business that you are running. Um, they should know the ins and outs of QSRs, of franchise structures, of multiple location payroll runs, having workers at different locations in different regions in the same pay period. Um, all of those things should not create hiccups or painful moments or costly penalties for you running your business as an employer. Um, running a business, as I said earlier, is hard enough. Trying to keep up with the myriad of compliance regulations should not add to that complexity for an employer. Um, and it's often area where if you do have a payroll provider who really does specialize in your industry, they can and should support you as an employer and take that burden off of your plate, not make your job harder. Daniel (40:01): Yeah. Um, now one question that came to mind as you were saying that, you know, uh, there are certain payroll providers that are kind of the, the most popular, the ones that maybe a lot of people think of when they think of the concept of a a payroll software. Um, what are those industries like, which industries are those providers typically built around or what are, you know, what are they most represented? Uh, as far as like, it's probably, I'm guessing it's probably not quick service restaurants, so, uh, yeah, I'd love to know <laugh>. Do you, do you know which, which are the other industries that they're typically more represented by? Kerri (40:37): Yeah, yeah. Um, you're right, it is not quick service, uh, restaurants. Um, think about your largest employers from like a centralized standpoint, so healthcare workers, for example, um, and white collar desk workers. So desk based employment often, um, is, is uh, where most of these, um, payroll, larger payroll providers, um, who've been around for decades, um, focus, uh, government workers for example. Um, so often where there are not hourly wage workers, non-exempt workers, it's more exempt based. You don't have the complexity of overtime regulations in that regard. You don't have the shift differential issues to deal with. You oftentimes don't have the multi-location concerns, um, varying jobs and responsibilities and varying pay rates associated with those varying jobs in a payroll. And so those largest employers, um, those, those typically, they aren't tailored, they don't need to be tailored. They're, I'm salary, I'm exempt, I don't have a lot of complex nuance payroll regulations to comply with. And that's why a lot of these larger, more popular payroll platforms, um, have been able to, you know, sustain for decades, um, without innovating. It's, you know, more generalist, it's more, um, one size fits all as we talked about. And so I don't have to support all the, the complexity that a quick service restaurant, um, requires, for example. And, um, so that, I would say that's probably where a lot of the, the industry focus is, is geared towards, um, like I said, desk based workers, government, healthcare. Daniel (42:21): Yeah. Now, uh, in terms of those businesses that employ a lot of hourly workers, you know, quick service restaurants, et cetera, um, what are some specific features or, or functionality that you should be on the lookout for if you're, if you're trying to avoid the one size fits all, you know, you think of in terms of, uh, your vetting different solutions going to their website, what sort of bullet points should you be looking for to make sure it's like, no, the, this business understands what I actually need, uh, with my my hourly workforce? Kerri (42:56): Yeah, yeah. Um, the things I would, I would hit on are features, um, around faster payroll. As we've talked about. These are hourly employers, they are employees, excuse me, they're often living paycheck to paycheck. And so does the payroll platform provide next day pay, for example, can, can I work, you know, a set of hours today and be paid for those hours tomorrow? Um, as an employer perspective, how many payroll runs? A lot of these legacy platforms are more standardized and I run payroll once a week and I have to make sure I get all of my employees in that payroll run once a week, otherwise you might charge me more. Um, or I have to write it, you know, do the check manually instead of direct deposit, you know, so unlimited payroll runs are really important in this particular industry with hourly workers, um, ability to pay hourly employees at any combination of workplaces. (43:50): We've talked about, you know, the need to be able to support multiple work locations. Um, so any combination of, of earnings, because I, as I said, worked as a dishwasher one day, worked the front service counter the next, um, and worked in, you know, one location in one city one day and then another city in location the next. Can you support that? Um, custom earning codes and earning rates is another one that I think is really important, important for these hourly workers as well. Um, you know, and then from an another, just last one from an employee perspective is how much work is, are, you know, is there on me as the employer to make sure when I hire new employees, a lot of seasonality happens, A lot of temporary work. We talked about the student employee earlier. Uh, example, I'm bringing on lots of employees in the summer months who are often students and they come and go after three months. You know, do, am I as the employer having to do a lot of that employee onboarding or do you as a payroll provider help, um, with, you know, with that, uh, or do you give the employee a way to do it themselves? Um, so those are a handful of things we haven't touched on yet that I would call out. Daniel (44:59): Yeah. Another, uh, another great list. I think maybe print out a second one and put that on the wall too. Um, as for things to remember. Um, Kerri, thank you so much for, for sharing all of your knowledge and your expertise today. I think I'm speaking for everyone that's going to be watching this. I think this has been very, very helpful, um, and especially appreciate like all of the specific examples of, of things people should be looking for, um, as they're vetting their payroll provider to hopefully, hopefully, uh, you know, if if some people watching this aren't that satisfied right now, they can get to a better place and, and find one that's more of a partner, like you said. Yeah. Um, I just wanted to give you the opportunity, you know, with, you know, all those people watching this. Do you have one final takeaway recommendation, uh, or one final thought? Kerri (45:50): Yeah, Daniel, thanks so much. Um, really appreciate you having me. Like I said, hopefully this is helpful and I haven't scared any employers off from, you know, trying to handle the nuanced comp, you know, compliance and payroll regulations that impact their business. Um, hopefully they don't walk, that's not the main takeaway after seeing this. It's more so there are better solutions out there, whereas maybe a, you know, five to 10 years ago there weren't, and if you find, you know, the right payroll provider to do exactly like you said, be your partner, um, as opposed to a vendor and just a transactional relationship, it really can be a game changer for your business and it is worth it. Um, and it's worth it because you will get better support. Um, they, you know, payroll providers like Workstream exists now. They didn't used to exist before. They're providing really amazing, phenomenal support, um, and doing it in some game changing ways that make it not painful to switch. So there's better out there. Um, so have faith and um, it doesn't have to be as complicated as it's today. TAGS Payroll Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

How do you find reliable candidates faster? Starting an employee referral program is a great strategy. Referred applicants are less likely to turnover and more likely to be high performers. Having a referral program in place allows your employees to be an additional layer of filtering in the hiring process, where they can help determine whether the job would be a good fit for the candidate and vice versa. Your employees are the best ambassadors for your business because they know how the company functions and what personalities and characteristics are the best fit for your company culture. Ever heard of the saying birds of a feather flock together ? By tapping into your employees' network, you increase the chances of getting more applicants with similar characteristics as your current employees, as they're likely to befriend people similar to themselves. This means if your employee is hardworking or detail-oriented, the person they refer could have similar characteristics, too. On the flip side, they can also determine if their friends or family members have the skills and work ethic you're looking for. This means they're more likely to recommend applicants suited for the role and will also be careful about who they refer because their reputation is also on the line. In this guide, you'll learn all about employee referral programs and how to build one that works for you and your team. At the end, we've included a handy checklist to help you stay organized throughout the process. Do you need an employee referral program? Before you go buying gift cards and telling your employees to refer their friends, take a step back to consider your business case and any potential legal issues. Ask yourself these questions: How many hours could you save in recruiting by having a referral program in place? What are the cost savings? What are the costs necessary to put a referral program in place? Weigh the pros, cons, and costs to evaluate if this is the right move for your hiring strategy—and to help get buy-in from others involved in your hiring process if needed. Look into the legalities. Do you have in-house legal counsel, and if not, should you consider having one? Legal counsel is important to ensure you're building your program fairly and avoiding unintentional discrimination. Think of potential loopholes or areas that could be questioned. Ensure the referral program is open to the entire organization, all candidates will be screened equally, and fair recruiting methods are employed when sharing about new openings in the organization. Building an employee referral program A successful employee referral program is clearly defined, easy to follow, and optimized often. These are the five steps you should take to build a well-rounded and impactful program. Define the objectives Determine the process Decide on the incentive Collect feedback and review Amplify the program Determine the process Referral programs should be as straightforward as possible because the last thing you want to do is discourage employees from making referrals. How should you collect referrals? Employees could submit referrals through a form Some intranet portals enable employees to submit referrals Employees can make email introductions between you and their referee You can include a section in job applications that allows applicants to fill in the name and email address of their referrer What information should you collect? If you're collecting referrals through your applications, an applicant tracking system will manage your referrals for you. If you're using an alternative method listed above, be sure to collect all the information you need about the referee (name, email address, phone number) and the referrer (name, email address, phone number, employee number, location, etc.). Will you fast-track applications? Another question to consider is whether or not you will fast-track referred applicants. Do they get to skip a round of interviews, or do they go through the same hiring process as other applicants? Who can refer applicants? Some organizations restrict HR employees from participating due to a conflict of interest. Many organizations limit their programs to full-time, permanent employees and exclude temporary employees. Clearly indicate the terms and conditions of your program so your employees know who can participate and what is considered a successful referral, such as when they can expect to receive an incentive (if this is X days after the new hire's first day, or after they have passed their new hire probation period). How will you announce and promote your referral program? Tell your team in company-wide emails, during shift meetings, or even via your intranet or bulletin board. Think about how to market this to external candidates as well, as it could be considered an attractive employee benefit. It should also be part of the new hire onboarding process so all employees are aware of the program and know how to participate. Communication should be ongoing. Decide on the incentive Referral programs often come with an incentive to reward employees when their referee is offered the job. You may choose to go with a standard referral bonus or non-cash incentives like an extra day off, charity donations, food treats, or even recognition. Consider your incentive based on your budget and what you know about motivating your team. Incentives can even differ based on the type of role you’re hiring for. An employee who helped fill a harder-to-fill position could receive a larger referral bonus. Determine if a one-off payment, which is more commonly done, or a split payment works better for your organization. One-off payments are often processed once the new hire has been onboarded. Split payments are broken out into two cycles: after the new hire has been onboarded and when they’ve completed their probation period. Collect feedback and review After a month or two of running your employee referral program, begin asking for feedback and conducting reviews. This allows you to identify if the referral program is meeting the goals and objectives set in step 1. Review: Goals and objectives: Keep track of referrals to determine long-term goals such as retention and culture fit. Process: Do employees find it hard to use the system? Did anyone have issues receiving the incentive? How can you make the process more streamlined? Incentives: Have there been sufficient referrals? If not, consider looking into better incentives to motivate employees. You can even ask them! Metrics: Look at the number of employees hired from the referral program as opposed to other recruiting methods, the employee participation rate, your new hire retention rate, etc Constantly reviewing your referral program allows you to find areas for improvement and sometimes even uncover examples of employees abusing the system that you need to address. Amplify the program Now that you’ve launched and optimized your employee referral program, it’s time to increase its reach. Here are some ways to take your program up a notch: Accept referrals all the time instead of only when you have an active open position. This enables you to build a solid pool of applicants you can tap into when a position does open. Just remember to ask permission to keep an applicant’s resume on file. Have open communication with the employees and the candidates on the status of their referral to build trust and provide a positive experience for both parties. This encourages both the referrer and the referee to participate again should the opportunity arise. Share feedback on their referrals with your employees , such as their strengths and weaknesses and why their referrals were accepted or rejected. This will help your employees learn what you’re looking for and help them communicate with their friends or family members if they don't get the job. Have an efficient hiring process and evaluate candidates quickly to prevent losing them to other companies in the hiring process due to slow or no response There's a lot to consider when building an employee referral program. Check out our free employee referral program checklist to ensure you're not missing any details when building yours. Employee referral program checklist To build and maintain a successful employee referral program, you must ensure it’s clearly defined and easy to follow, streamlines the hiring process, and is often reviewed and optimized. Follow these six checklists to ensure you’re being thorough and thoughtful in building your program. Evaluate the need for a referral program Employee referral programs are effective ways to complement your hiring process and get your existing team involved. Review the criteria below. If at least one of the scenarios applies, an employee referral program may be right for your business. There is a shortage of candidates There is a shortage of quality candidates There is a budget for referral incentives Hiring managers spend more than half their day on hiring tasks Current hiring costs are high The current cost of hiring is more than the potential cost of setting up a referral program You have sufficient manpower to build and run the program You can consult a legal team on how to build an unbiased program Define the objectives Determine your goals and the outcomes you’re hoping to achieve so you can get buy-in from stakeholders and later evaluate how well your employee referral program is working. What is the goal of the hiring program? Hire more candidates each month How many? Increase employee retention How many months? Improve the culture fit of new employees How will you measure this? Performance outcomes Reduce hiring costs By how much (in %)? Reduce hiring time By how many hours? Increase % of accepted job offers How many? Increase the number of applicants in a month How many? Determine the process Referral programs should be as straightforward as possible because the last thing you want to do is deter employees from making a referral. Here are some things to consider as you’re building out your program Determine how you will collect referrals Through an online form Through an intranet portal Employees send an email to the hiring manager Having a field in the application form Collect referrer's information Name Work email address Mobile number Employee number Department Relationship with the applicant (depending on your organization) Collect referee's information Name Email address Mobile number Resume Notice period Program guidelines Will you fast-track referred applicants? Does the referred applicant get to skip a round of interviews? Or do they go through the process like regular candidates? Who can refer applicants? Full-time employees Part-time employees Senior management Human resources Others: When will employees receive their incentive? days after the new hire's first day After the probation period Once the new hire has been onboarded Payment of incentive One-off payment Split payment (into two cycles) After the new hire has been onboarded After probation period has been completed Announce the referral program to your employees Company-wide emails Shift meetings Intranet portal Bulletin boards Text notifications During manager check-ins Market the referral program to applicants Include it in the job description List it in the career portal Mention during career fairs List it on your organization’s website Decide on the incentive Referral programs often come with an incentive to reward employees when their applicant is offered the job. Consider your incentive based on your budget and what you know about motivating your team. Type of incentive Referral bonus Extra day off Gift cards Gift Food treats Charity donations Recognition during staff meetings Points (that can be redeemed) Collect feedback and review After a couple of months of running your referral program, take some time to review how well it’s performing and any adjustments you need to make. Goals and objectives. (Customize with the goals you set in step 1) Process Employees can use the system with ease No one has issues receiving the incentives No employees are abusing the system Incentives There have been sufficient referrals The referrals are attractive enough Metrics to track (number of) employees hired from the referral program vs. other recruitment methods Employee participation rate: Retention rate: Amplify the program Now that you’ve successfully launched and optimized your employee referral program, look into how to increase its reach and maximize it for scale. Expand the reach of your program Accept ongoing referrals even if you don’t have an active open position Ask for permission to keep resumes on file Have open communication with employees and applicants on the process Provide employees feedback on referred applicants (i.e. why a referral was hired or not) Share this article TAGS HR Resources Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

With recession fears on everyone's mind, industries like food and commodities are already getting impacted by a reduction in foot traffic and more conservative spending. As a business owner in the food, hospitality, or entertainment industries, there is no more important time than now to think of ways to retain your customer and recession-proof your business. And while it's easy to immediately consider what costs to cut, what you should really be asking yourself is where you can invest. Discounting is NOT the answer With inflation and food costs at record highs, spending money on dining and entertainment is likely first to gets cut from the budget. But discounting your product or service to attract customers today could lose you more customers tomorrow . Apart from possible price wars with your competitors (which won't end well), the biggest risk is that it could lead to a long-term negative perception of your product. Customers pay for products or services based on their perceived value of the product. But discounts can call into question the product’s original value. Discounts also primarily attract value-minded consumers. Sure, during an uncertain economic climate more consumers will be hunting for deals, but under stable circumstances, some of those same consumers will return to their regular spending tier. That means you've now attracted value consumers who will not be happy when you eventually increase prices again—and you've likely lost your target consumer who's moved on to brands that are more aligned to their original price point. Instead of giving consumers the same product or service for less, consider giving them more for the same cost—making their dollar feel like it goes further. Low lift ways to elevate the customer experience During an unstable economy, consumers will either cut luxuries completely or downgrade them. Families who regularly go to dinner at full-service restaurants might go to fast-casual restaurants instead.  Those who love weekend trips to the movie theater might try a dollar theater or digital rental. Adding value to the customer experience now is a great way to try to keep current customers from churning (by giving them more). It also helps new customers feel positive about choosing a budget-friendly option they may not have otherwise. Giving customers more during a potential recession may sound crazy, but there are relatively inexpensive things you can do that add value. Modified table service If you own or operate a quick-service restaurant (QSR), consider offering modified table service on Friday and Saturday nights. This is a relatively small disruption that won't require much more than potentially staffing an extra employee for those few shifts. But this small upgrade makes the dining experience a bit more special for your customers. Host a family night Times like these can be hard on families. Consider hosting a free kids night at your restaurant or throw in a free treat with any kids movie ticket. Providing extra perks for kids (which is often on the cheaper end), will make it easier for parents to choose your business when looking for ways to entertain their children. Rally your employees Ever wondered why Starbucks baristas ask for your name while taking your order? Starbucks first introduced this system in 2012 to make the in-store experience more personalized and friendly. It has now grown to be something that everyone attributes to the brand and makes it a leader in the coffee shop space. During stressful times, these small moments of personalization and delight can go a long way. Train your employees to ask about customers' days, give compliments, or crack jokes. Customers are always more likely to go to a business with happy, helpful, fun employees, than a place where the employees are memorable for the wrong reasons. Keep customers engaged Add low-cost elements to your business that keep customers hanging out longer.   This could come in the form of trivia nights where winners stand to win gift cards or even just bragging rights. Having several board games available in your lobby or restaurant, accessible to all customers, can also help liven up the atmosphere. These don’t have to be costly. Simple card games such as Uno and Monopoly Deal go a long way. Such games will also set your business apart from others, with the additional entertainment value which can be a huge plus, especially for friends who are looking to socialize. A little more goes a long way Customer experience is going to be increasingly important, especially with a recession on everyone's minds. Whether or not one hits, taking steps now to recession-proof your business by elevating the customer experience will keep your brand at the top of consumers' minds if their budgets do get tight.
