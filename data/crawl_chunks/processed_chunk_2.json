However, after implementing Workstream's user-friendly platform, his struggling locations saw a remarkable increase in applications, some up to 1400%, creating a brighter future for his Bojangles franchise. \"Within the first 90 days is when we typically lose people. If we can monitor their progress at 30, 60, and 90 days, we’re more likely to retain them over a year. Workstream has helped keep that organized because we know when they’ve applied, interviewed, have data and key metrics from pre-hire to post-hire that helps you to retain people, which is obviously huge dollars and cents.\" Rajiv Dinakaran Owner and Operator, Georgia Foods, LLC. dba Bojangles The problem Low applicant flow hurts growing franchise business About Bojangles Georgia Foods is a 41 location franchisee of Bojangles. Bojangles is an American fast-food restaurant chain specializing in Southern-inspired cuisine, with a particular focus on biscuits, chicken, and breakfast items. It was founded in 1977 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and has since grown to become a popular regional chain primarily located in the Southeastern United States with both company-owned and franchise locations. Locations: 800+ Industry: Restaurants Employees: 9,900 Rajiv Dinakaran cares a lot about every employee who works at his 41 (and counting) Bojangles locations in Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. Long before becoming a franchisee himself, he worked at his father’s Bojangles restaurant as a crew person while in high school. Because of his 15 years of industry experience, Rajiv realized hiring would always be a big concern or a big opportunity—especially when trying to acquire and staff new locations. With an HR platform that required job postings and applications on employment sites to be managed manually, time that could be spent training and developing crew members was being dedicated to paperwork. Five years into being a franchisee, Rajiv also noticed certain locations were only averaging two or three applications a month. When asking people at his struggling Bojangles restaurants about their hiring challenges, it simply came down to “we just can’t find help.” But was it really a matter of not having enough job seekers to staff those franchises or not reaching them where they are? the solution Simplifying hiring for applicants and managers alike While looking for a more user-friendly hiring solution, Rajiv and his operations team discovered Workstream. Within 60 days of using the platform, once struggling locations began averaging 30 to 40 applications per month—an increase of as much as 1400%. Rather than struggling to find help, those very same Bojangles restaurants are now fully staffed. Text-to-apply For Heather Cunrod, Director of People & Culture for Rajiv’s Bojangles locations, Workstream has been a game changer. “I definitely think it’s cut about 50% of my time. They can just text to apply and do the application on their phone—instead of walking into a location, getting a paper application, sitting down, filling it out, handing it in, not knowing where they’re at in the process.” Onboarding The platform also streamlined the onboarding experience for hiring managers. “Before,” Rajiv recalls, “someone’s birthday was entered (in the system) something crazy like 12 times because they had to enter it in the initial application, enter it in their hiring paperwork, then enter it in the back-office PC, and then enter it into payroll. Versus Workstream, it’s just like they apply (once) and it’s done. What used to take 20 minutes a person is down to maybe a minute.” Team Operations With Workstream, Rajiv’s operations team has also improved their retention strategy overnight. “Within the first 90 days is when we typically lose people. If we can monitor their progress at 30, 60, and 90 days, we’re more likely to retain them over a year. Workstream has helped keep that organized because we know when they’ve applied, interviewed, have data and key metrics from pre-hire to post-hire that helps you to retain people, which is obviously huge dollars and cents.” 1400% increase in applications built for the hourly workforce Back office operations are under control Workstream has streamlined Heather’s entire recruitment, hiring, and onboarding process. She can realistically get somebody in the door within an hour after an interview—which is especially helpful when you average 50 hires every week and need to ensure their direct deposits are good to go. For Rajiv, Workstream is a no-brainer. His operations team now enjoys a one-stop shop for their staffing needs at all 41 locations. Assistant managers, store managers, and district managers can now spend more time shaping work culture, knowing their staffing needs are taken care of.

Promotions Any sweepstakes, contests, raffles, surveys, games, or similar promotions (collectively, “ Promotions ”) made available through the Services or by us may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules, as well as please see our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms, the Promotion rules will govern. 18. Dispute Resolution Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (the “ Arbitration Agreement ”) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with us or our Workstream Parties and limits the way you can seek relief from us or our Workstream Parties . a. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (collectively, the “ Dispute ”), which cannot be resolved informally in accordance with Section 18(b) below, shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any actual, alleged or threatened violation of confidentiality or violation of Workstream or its providers intellectual property or other proprietary rights, Workstream or its provider may immediately resort to court proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth above in order to seek immediate injunctive relief without posting of a bond, proof of damages or other similar requirement. The institution of any action for injunctive relief does not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit any claim seeking relief other than injunctive relief to arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement applies to You and Workstream and any Workstream Party. b. Informal Dispute Resolution There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and us. If that occurs, we are committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and us agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and us therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference. c. Arbitration Rules and Forum The arbitration proceeding will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“ AAA ”) before a single arbitrator selected pursuant to the AAA rules. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding. Any final award or judgment may be filed and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties shall share equally in the costs assessed for the arbitration, and each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. Any arbitration proceeding may not be consolidated or joined with any other proceeding and will not proceed as a class action. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE THEIR CASE, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING INVOLVING MULTIPLE CLAIMANTS, BUT THEY INSTEAD CHOOSE AND AGREE TO HAVE ALL DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN DECIDED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION . d. Place . The place of arbitration shall be San Francisco, California, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties to the arbitration. The parties acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1–16, shall govern the interpretation, enforcement and proceedings pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. The parties expressly agree that any and all actions taken under the Arbitration Agreement and related provisions, including but not limited to all filings, orders, judgments, and awards made in any arbitration proceeding, are confidential and may not be disclosed to any third party. e. Survival . This Arbitration Agreement provision will survive the termination of these Terms. f. Time Limitation on Claims. The parties agree that they must initiate arbitration within one (1) year after any Dispute arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred. g. Class Action Waiver . YOU AND WORKSTREAM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both You and Workstream agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. h. Waiver of Jury Trial EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 18(A)  YOU AND WORKSTREAM AND APPLICABLE WORKSTREAM PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You, Workstream, and any of the Workstream Parties are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 18(a) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. 19. Governing Law Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles. If any dispute between the parties is not subject to arbitration, then the state and federal courts located in Dover County, Delaware, will have exclusive jurisdiction. You and Workstream waive any objection to the venue in any such courts. If your local law requires that consumer contracts be interpreted subject to local law and enforced in the courts of that jurisdiction, this section may not apply to you (but only to the extent that local law conflicts with this section). 20. Disclosures for California Customers If you are an individual residing in California, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210. 21. Terms Applicable To New Jersey Consumers No provision in these Terms will apply to any consumer in New Jersey if the provision limits remedies for (i) negligence, (ii) products liability claims, (iii) the punitive damages laws, (iv) the New Jersey Uniform Commercial Code, or (v) failure to reasonably protect against harm arising from certain criminal acts of third parties (e.g., computer hacking and identity theft). The provisions of these Terms concerning the exclusion or limitation of certain damages are not applicable in New Jersey with respect to statutory damages, punitive damages, loss of data, and loss of or damage to property. Workstream reserves all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under the laws of New Jersey and under the laws of your state. 22. Electronic Communications For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights. 23.Severability and No Waiver If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Workstream’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. 24. Export Control You are responsible for complying with the export laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you represent, warrant, and covenant that you are not: (1) located in, or a resident or a national of, any country subject to a U.S. government embargo; (2) listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties; or (3) engaged in activities directly or indirectly related to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 25. Entire Agreement These Terms (including any Supplemental Terms) reflect the entire agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, representations, statements and understandings of the parties. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Use of the word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.” Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically. Please note that e-mail communications will not necessarily be secure; accordingly, you should not include credit card information or other sensitive information in your e-mail correspondence with us.

It's more than just calculating hours worked and issuing paychecks; it involves several other components like managing tipped employees , setting up payment schedules, and ensuring direct deposits are done correctly. Defining Restaurant Payroll The backbone of any successful restaurant business lies in its effective management of payroll. ' Restaurant payroll ' is the sum of money spent on wages by a restaurant proprietor, which encompasses not just hourly pay or salary but also gratuities for employees who earn more than $30 per month in tips. This includes not only hourly wage or salary but also tips for your staff who regularly receive over $30 per month in tips - they fall under the category of tipped employees . The challenge comes when we consider multiple pay rates for different roles within the establishment. For example, chefs might be salaried while servers work on an hourly basis with variable tip income each month. Understanding Gross Pay in Restaurants Gross pay plays an essential role as well in this equation because it's how much your employees earn before deductions like taxes and insurance premiums are taken out. Calculating gross pay can get tricky especially when considering overtime pay and differential rates that apply to working during holidays or outside regular shift hours. It's important to note, the perfect labor cost percentage typically falls between 25% and 35% of sales. This varies based on whether you're running a fine dining establishment or a casual eatery. Understanding Payroll Taxes for Restaurants Navigating the world of payroll taxes can feel like traversing a culinary minefield. But fear not, we've got your back. Here's an overview to help you make sense of it all. Payroll Taxes Explained The first thing to understand is that restaurants are required by law to pay certain types of payroll taxes . These include FICA and MEDFICA which finance social insurance programs such as Social Security and Medicare. To put it in simple terms, imagine if each dollar earned was a delicious pie. You'd need to slice off pieces (tax) for Uncle Sam before serving up the rest (net pay). Now picture this happening every time wages are paid out - welcome to the reality of restaurant payroll . Paying these correctly helps ensure employees' future financial security while keeping your business compliant with tax laws. But how do you know what amount should be deducted? That’s where things get tricky because calculation varies based on factors like total hours worked or tipped income received by staff during any given pay period . Gusto , one popular choice among small businesses , simplifies this process through their full-service software system making sure no stone is left unturned when it comes down calculating and filing appropriate amounts due from both employer employee side each wage cycle – saving you more time than waiting for dough rise at home. Remember: Just like crafting the perfect menu requires understanding different ingredients and their impact on the final dish, so too does managing a successful restaurant involve mastering the complexities of payroll taxes . Ensuring Compliance with Minimum Wage Laws Restaurant owners face unique challenges when it comes to minimum wage laws . These laws can be a tricky maze, especially when considering tipped employees . Navigating Minimum Wage Laws for Tipped Employees Tipped employees are those who customarily and regularly receive more than $30 per month in tips. It's essential that restaurant businesses keep track of these tips as they impact the base wage paid by the employer. If the wages plus tips of an employee do not reach the federal minimum wage , employers must supplement to make up for it. The complexity increases because some states have a higher minimum wage than at the federal level. This means restaurants operating across different states need accurate data about each state’s individual laws. To ensure compliance with these varying rules, many restaurant owners use software tools such as Gusto Payroll Software . Such tools not only automate payroll calculations but also provide real-time updates on changing labor law requirements. Paying attention to minimum wage regulations is crucial for your business – not just because you want to avoid legal trouble or penalties but also because fair pay practices boost staff morale and help retain top talent. Managing Employee Benefits and Compensation To retain your staff in the competitive restaurant business, it's essential to manage employee benefits and compensation effectively. To stay ahead of the competition, you must devise a comprehensive benefits and compensation package. Implementing Effective Compensation Strategies In order to attract top talent and maintain an engaged workforce, offering competitive salaries is key. But that's not all; tipped employees need special attention too. According to federal law, if tips don't bring them up to the minimum wage level, employers are required to make up the difference. Beyond wages though, providing comprehensive health insurance options shows employees they're valued. Health coverage is often seen as a significant benefit by workers across industries - restaurants included. It also pays off for businesses themselves: good health care means healthier employees who take fewer sick days and can give their best at work each day. A great way of retaining your star performers is through incentives such as bonuses or profit sharing schemes based on meeting specific goals or milestones. It's a win-win situation – when your team does well, so does your restaurant. All these efforts lead towards better employee retention rates because people appreciate being rewarded for hard work with tangible benefits besides just paychecks. Streamlining the Payroll Process for Restaurant Owners As a restaurant owner , managing payroll can be as complicated as perfecting your grandma's secret spaghetti sauce recipe. But it doesn't have to be. The beauty of the day and age we live in is that old manual tasks can now be automated. The days of a payroll service being on paper and pen and then delivered through check which gets taken to a bank and deposited in a bank account are long gone. The functionality of the payroll process is easy and seamless and takes some pressure off of business owners and even new hires . The Impact of Payroll on Restaurant Operations When it comes to restaurant operations, payroll isn't just a matter of compensating staff - it has an extensive influence on the business. It's an integral part of the business that directly affects various aspects of operations. Payroll and Labor Expenses From servers to chefs, each employee contributes significantly towards labor expenses. This is where effective payroll management can make a difference. Keeping track of hours worked and managing overtime pay not only helps maintain accurate data but also aids in controlling food costs by reducing unnecessary labor expenses. Influence on Employee Retention A reliable payroll system that ensures timely direct deposits fosters trust among staff members, thereby enhancing retention rates. Regularly receive correct payments without errors? Now that's what makes employees stick around. Taxes and Compliance Issues An efficient restaurant payroll software keeps you compliant with wage laws at both the federal level and state levels while handling tax payment responsibilities like unemployment tax or income tax efficiently. Better Decision Making through Reports Tracking Wrapping things up, quality payroll reports shed light on your labor distribution. This insight is a game changer when it comes to making strategic calls for what's next. After all, \"What gets measured gets managed.\" FAQs in Relation to Restaurant Payroll What should payroll be for a restaurant? A healthy restaurant payroll should range between 25% to 35% of total sales, although it varies based on the type and size of your eatery. How do restaurants calculate payroll? To figure out restaurant payroll , you add up gross wages, account for overtime pay , factor in tips for tipped employees , then deduct necessary taxes. How do I create a payroll for my employees? You can make an employee's payroll by figuring their hours worked times hourly wage . Then subtract withholdings like taxes and benefits. Payroll software makes this easier. Conclusion When it comes to restaurant payroll , we've stirred the pot and served up a feast of knowledge. Understanding gross pay , handling tipped employees , keeping track of hours worked - all key ingredients for your success. Navigating minimum wage laws isn't easy but with some guidance, you can ensure fair compensation. Remember that leveraging software tools like Gusto or Homebase simplifies this process significantly. In essence, managing restaurant payroll is not just about crunching numbers. It's an art form requiring precision and patience to balance labor expenses while retaining staff through competitive benefits. Your journey may have started in the kitchen but mastering restaurant payroll helps make sure your business thrives long-term!

As a veritable “jack-of-all-trades,” it’s his job to make sure everything is running smoothly—and that means everything from hiring to installing carpet if a new location needs it. \"The time savings have been incalculable with Workstream.\" Michael Hartley Director of Operations The problem Hiring in new markets About Golden Ticket Cinemas With over 20 locations across 12 states, Golden Ticket Cinemas is one of the fastest growing theatre chains in the country. They pride themselves in creating a \"modern theatre experience for small and mid-size markets across the US.\" Industry: Theatres As Golden Ticket expands, Michael oversees the opening of more theaters and expansion into new markets. But as exciting as growth is, hiring and onboarding quality employees is a huge time suck. That required hours every week sourcing, screening, interviewing, and onboarding, which left little time to focus on other priorities in his role. One big hurdle: reaching a pool of quality applicants in a new area. Navigating local job boards, social media, and other networks eats up precious time. With the pressure of being fully staffed come opening day, he has to move fast, and there simply isn’t room to stress over a new recruitment strategy. More problems came with onboarding. Making sure his employees were correctly filling out the proper paperwork and then having to manually enter that paperwork into the system led to more headaches than Michael cared for. In his words, “How can we focus on innovation when we’re filling out paperwork all day?” This system is not sustainable for any business, let alone a growing one, and Michael knew it. After searching for fixes, he found Workstream. The solution An all-in-one platform Michael turned to Workstream first for its hiring capabilities, and soon realized how important it was to have all his HR functions under one platform. Adopting this all-in-one approach has changed the game by increasing operational efficiency and automating manual tasks. Having the right system in place has given Michael time to focus on innovating and removed a huge burden off his shoulders. Hiring quality candidates Workstream has allowed Michael to easily find the right people for a role by helping Golden Ticket stand out in new job markets. Recalling a recent experience, he said, “When I put the listing up, I had no idea what I was going to get for applications. I soon had 200 to go through. It was actually faster than we were ready for.” Implementing the right system Focusing on having the right systems in place has helped Michael keep overhead costs down, allowing him to spend more time training and developing employees, serving customers, and finding other areas to improve. “With Workstream, my systems and data are finally working for me, not against me.” Streamlining payroll Avoiding manual data entry has been a game changer for Michael’s business. Running payroll is no longer a major source of stress, since it’s baked into the same HR platform he uses for hiring and onboarding. the wins Peace amidst the chaos Perhaps Michael’s favorite part of switching to Workstream is the peace of mind he feels. Having a trusted ecosystem and relationship that he can lean on is a huge benefit. “Workstream has been one of the better decisions we’ve made.” See how Workstream can help you manage and pay your hourly workforce",

The hardest part? Keeping them engaged in the process without losing them to the competition. \"The team at Workstream sees their customers as a gift. If you're going to sign up with Workstream, you're going to be given immense value now and into the future.\" Tim Sweetman Owner/Operator The problem Hiring the right people About Tim Sweetman Industry: Restaurant Tim understands that the first step to keeping his customers happy is hiring the right people. “Our customers deserve to have great employees that are serving them,” he explains, “We don’t want to waste any time or run short staffed and give customers a bad experience because we are struggling to onboard somebody or wasting time on administrative tasks.” The question, though, was how? Attracting great talent wasn’t the problem. The problem was keeping applicants engaged long enough to actually hire them. With no way for candidates to track their application status, they would resort to calling Tim for updates. They were often getting lost in the shuffle or quickly snagged by competitors. Rather than filling an open role in a few days, it  took as long as several weeks. A manual onboarding process followed, requiring new hires to learn the platforms, apps, and software needed to do their job. For Tim, this is one of the hardest aspects of hiring new employees. “No matter how good we’re going to be, we’re going to have turnover at some point.To have to reteach a tool is really really difficult. It’s also really difficult to have multiple apps that you’re having to learn and implement.” Jumping back and forth between several different apps is confusing and takes up too much time. Tim knew there had to be a better approach. The solution Streamlining HR tasks through automation and consolidation Once Tim discovered Workstream, he realized it was what he had been searching for. It ticked all the boxes and solved his number one pet peeve: wasted time. By automating the recruiting, hiring, and onboarding processes, plus consolidating his tech stack, Workstream helped save time and alleviate the burden of switching through a mess of apps. Quick onboarding With Workstream, not only does he keep applicants engaged but also onboards them faster than before so they can do what they do best–provide exceptional food and service. All-in-one platform Tim put it best: “Time is money for us. We need people who are serving customers. We don’t want to waste a lot of time doing other things. Before Workstream, there were a number of areas that we would have to manually import into an HR platform. It just didn’t speak well. And now with a click of a button, everything is placed into our HR platform. Someone is onboarded literally in an instant. There’s a ton of time saved there. It allows employees to just jump right in.” the wins More time to focus on what matters most By increasing the efficiency of his business, Tim has been able to provide more value for his customers—and that’s what matters most. With Workstream, he has the tools to empower his team, provide exceptional service, and embrace further innovation. See how Workstream can help you manage and pay your hourly workforce",

    "text": "Crumbl franchisee gains applicants and operational efficiency with Workstream For six-location Crumbl franchisee Christian Bankhead, attracting new applicants was the easy part. The challenge Christian faced was losing those applicants somewhere in the hiring process. Between the initial screenings and interviews, he estimated only 5 percent of applicants would return to complete the hiring cycle. After switching to Workstream and shortening the cycle down to just a week, everything changed. “The biggest thing is the customer service. I know my implementation specialist by name. I also know my payroll customer support by name. It’s awesome! That makes me feel that I’m valued.” Christian Bankhead Multi-unit franchise owner and operator, Crumbl The problem Keeping applicants engaged felt impossible About Crumbl Crumbl Cookies is a fast-growing bakery franchise known for its rotating menu of freshly baked, gourmet cookies. Founded in 2017 in Logan, Utah, Crumbl offers an innovative weekly lineup of unique cookie flavors alongside its signature warm chocolate chip cookie. With a focus on quality ingredients, eye-catching presentation, and a fun, interactive customer experience, Crumbl has expanded to hundreds of locations across the U.S. Its iconic pink boxes and viral social media presence have made it a favorite among dessert lovers nationwide. Brand: Crumbl Industry: Restaurant Employees: 29,000+ Locations: 1,000+ Finding the right number of qualified applicants on a consistent basis is challenging enough. For Christian, the bigger problem was keeping those applicants engaged throughout the hiring process. He was losing up to 75 percent of new employees before they ever started. “We struggled to communicate consistently with our applicants. We would review them once a week and invite them for an interview. Maybe they would remember their interview…or not. And we were only getting about 5 percent to actually really come in and complete the hiring cycle,” Christian said. For a long time, he relied on multiple programs to handle their recruiting, hiring, and onboarding needs. “One of the most frustrating parts as a new manager is trying to figure out all the different systems and platforms. When someone was hired, we had to tell them to download seven apps.” Employee retention was another major hurdle for Christian. “There is a series of checklist items that we need to do for them to be able to work. Even those we hired, we struggled to retain even 25 percent of them. To staff my store, I was interviewing hundreds of people and having thousands of applicants. That was really hard. It was very time consuming for my general managers and myself.” Hiring quickly began to conflict with daily operations. To manage all six locations and his growing workforce more effectively, he needed an all-in-one solution that could do more than recruit and hire employees. The solution Improving admin processes with one integrated HR platform During his search for a platform that fit his needs, Christian gave Workstream a try. Almost immediately, he noticed the difference—especially when compared to the systems of the past. Not only for its ability to source applicants, but for how it benefited his existing employees. One app for workers and managers Christian’s employees found it difficult to locate important information without his help. “The majority of my employees want to understand when they’re getting paid, what the dates were in their pay period, their withholdings and things like that.” Today, those details and more are readily accessible with one app. Automated interview scheduling “When we made the transition to Workstream, it became very automated. And the thing I liked most is the ability to schedule right away—being able to set my open schedule and have them pick availability. Instead of us having to reach out and find a time for these applicants, they were appearing within the next day. It was really powerful and got us way faster into the hiring cycle.” Faster onboarding Workstream optimized Christian’s hiring-to-onboarding process as well. “My demands change week to week. When I need to bring somebody on, I often need to bring them on within a week. It shortened our total hiring cycle from probably three weeks down to a week. That made a massive difference.” the wins Investing in the future Workstream saves Christian hours every week. Time spent hiring for all six Crumbl locations has gone from 15 hours a week down to five. Smart screening questions help ensure that everyone who comes in to interview is qualified and ready to go. But more than just an HR tool, Christian sees Workstream as a differentiator. \"One of the toughest parts about hiring hard workers is they often will take the first job presented to them. Being fast and being agile helps us present an offer to them faster than our competitors.” “It allows me to kind of figure out where to invest my time. It’s kind of like an investment. One that pays over time and continues to improve. But I can tell you that you’ll see it right away.” See how Workstream can help you manage and pay your hourly workforce",

That’s why it has to be easy. As a business owner you want to protect yourself and have the most efficient software that is easy to use.” Nadeem Bajwa Owner, Bajco Group, Papa Johns The problem Efficiency suffers when operations aren't streamlined About Bajco Group After the success of its first two Papa Johns locations in 2002, Bajco Group quickly expanded into one of the largest Papa Johns franchisees in the US. It now owns and operates over 260 locations in 11 states, with more on the way. Its vision and mission to become a best-in-class owner-operator in QSR guides it in leveraging cutting-edge technology to create value for its customers and employees. Locations: 260+ Industry: Restaurants In the restaurant industry, there’s never enough time. Nadeem noticed that his store managers were forced to juggle daily operations with the ongoing responsibility of hiring and onboarding new team members. With competing responsibilities jostling for priority, many managers were unable to prioritize effectively and hiring and onboarding fell through the cracks. Nadeem summarized the challenge: “Normally there’s one general manager working the restaurant. If you have two new team members to onboard, do you want to focus on your customer, or are you going to focus on [onboarding]? Both are important. But your customer is not going to wait around.” Beyond efficiency challenges, escalating costs also brought mounting pressure for Bajco Group, and with it came the need to balance growth and service against the relentless rise in food and labor expenses. Nadeem was at a crossroads: find a better process or face the consequences. The solution Integrating HR, hiring, and payroll for a smooth admin experience After being introduced to Workstream, Nadeem realized that an all-in-one approach to payroll, HR, and hiring was what he had been looking for. Not only did Workstream deliver a modern, user-friendly experience, but it allowed him to consolidate several disconnected tools into one streamlined system. Instantly updated records “We used to onboard somebody,” Nadeem explained, “then there was more manual work which would frustrate the managers. With [Workstream], you just onboard and everything–all information–just flows to the end and that makes everybody’s job really easy.” User-friendly software \"As a business owner, you want to have the most efficient software that is easy to use. It's all about user experience,\" says Nadeem. With Workstream's efficient, user-friendly platform, even his less tech-savvy employees can navigate it effortlessly. the wins Better efficiency = better customer service Nadeem believes that when businesses equip their teams with the right tools, they empower their employees to focus on what matters most: delivering exceptional customer service. In partnering with Workstream, he bet that all-in-one technology would unlock the efficiency he’d been looking for, and the early results speak for themselves.

You don't have to fill out these forms on one side and then go to payroll and fill out the other forms. They just merge together. That's super easy for me.\" Kim Major Hiring Manager, Culver's of Louisville The problem Disjointed processes bring complicated problems About Culver's Culver’s got its start in 1984 in Sauk City, Wisconsin—the beloved hometown of founders Craig and Lea Culver. Along with Craig’s parents, George and Ruth, Culver’s built a loyal following by serving up their now legendary signature combination of ButterBurgers with Frozen Custard. Since day one, the Culver family has realized that the secret to lasting success is always about putting people first. In 1990, the first Culver’s franchise opened in nearby Baraboo, WI, quickly followed by more beyond state lines in 1995. Today, Culver’s can be found across 26 states in the US. Locations: 965 Industry: Restaurants Employees: 25,000+ When Kim took over hiring and onboarding, scheduling interviews was the most difficult part of her day. She spent hours tracking down applicants only for them to ghost her. “I had to call them and a lot of people don’t answer the phone for a number they don’t know.” But because there was no other option, she was stuck chasing applicants. And once an applicant was hired, Kim faced another road block: onboarding. Before Workstream, this task was done the old fashioned way: on paper. Trying to track, organize, and maintain the flow of documents felt impossible. Running payroll brought another set of complex challenges. Outsourcing payroll processing seemed to solve the complexity issue–until it didn’t. Rather than saving time, outsourcing actually created more confusion than before. Kim had to spend hours wrangling data and correcting errors. It was time for a change. The solution Automating and integrating hiring, onboarding, and payroll Workstream was the game changer that Kim had been looking for. The automated interview scheduling, digital onboarding, and payroll functionalities brought immediate time savings, and also helped reduce stress. Automate interview scheduling Kim loves that applicants can use Workstream to schedule their own interviews and receive automated reminders. She estimates that the time she spends scheduling interviews has been cut in half. “I have my availability, and they pick a time that’s convenient for them and me… I now probably spend more time actually doing the interviews than trying to get people to come in for the interviews.” Digital onboarding Digital onboarding has also been a godsend: “With Workstream I have an onboarding checklist that’s like, okay your tasks are done, you can move on. I can just click on [someone’s] name and it’s all right there.” Save time on payroll Payroll is also much easier for Kim since she can now quickly do everything herself. “It’s super easy. I can probably get payroll done in 15 to 20 minutes. If there are pay changes or benefit changes, I can go in and put them in immediately. I don’t have to wait. That way everything is done. It’s that simple… it’s all in my hands. I don’t have to worry about a third party.” the wins Save time and stress Kim loves that she now enjoys a better connection with new hires thanks to Workstream. She can get them interviewed, hired, onboarded, and paid faster and with fewer headaches than before, all of which frees up valuable time that she can spend on higher-impact responsibilities. She’s excited to explore more of the all-in-one functionality that Workstream offers and introduce other Culver’s groups to the platform so they can experience the improved efficiency for themselves.

Kendra Rustebakke, an Administrative Manager at Dall-Haus, LTD, Jake’s franchise group, experienced this challenge firsthand: “We started with paper employee files and eventually moved to an online applicant system. But it made it more complicated and made it harder to really track everything.” As Sandi Anderson, Director of Operations at Dall-Haus, LTD, notes, “You would have to look through resumes, and then individually call them, or send a message, or an email to the applicant and try to get a hold of them.” Going through applications alone could take up a good chunk of the day—without any guarantee of reaching someone or setting up an interview. Their previous hiring and onboarding tools were also limited when it came to managing an existing workforce across several restaurants and multiple states. They needed a system designed for greater efficiency. Even a beloved QSR like Culver’s isn’t immune to retention problems. Turnover remains a huge deal throughout the industry. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data suggests a 75% annual rate of employee turnover, meaning three out of every four restaurant workers hired quit within one year. For Jake, clear and easy communication was essential to improving retention. It would all be so much easier with one solution to address the needs of his growing business. The solution A more efficient HR workflow While searching for an HR management system that would streamline the recruiting, hiring, and onboarding process across his nine Culver’s locations, Jake discovered Workstream. Right away, its automated, user-friendly, and mobile-first functionality proved to be a winning combination. Simplifying day-to-day operations Jake loved just how simple Workstream was to get up and running from his first log-in. “In this day and age, we have information overload, which is a great thing. But sometimes getting that information and using it correctly is a bit of a challenge,” Jake notes. “But I can get into Workstream easy. I don’t have to use a cheat sheet for how to access stuff. Any given time I can log into Workstream and get a quick snapshot on where we’re at, whether it’s high level or if it’s down to the details of any particular applicant.” Improving communication “When you’re going between multiple locations, the goal is keeping to that schedule,” Sandi says. And her schedule often includes finding, contacting, interviewing, and hiring great candidates. “With Workstream, it’s a lot faster just to get a hold of them. It sends out automated messages. I think that’s really nice for the applicant because they immediately hear back right after applying.” She estimates the time to fill roles at her Culver’s locations has been cut by 50% simply by how Workstream reduces the usual back-and-forth communication needed just to reach an applicant. 50% reduction in time to hire 3X applicant volume the wins Personalization and speed = hiring success Every day, Jake and his team find new ways to get the most out of Workstream. Sandi likes how managers can add their names to direct messages for a personal touch. Faster response times resulted in a higher volume of applicants than before. Their Waterloo Culver’s location alone received 3X the amount, with Cedar Falls now close behind with 2X the applicant volume since joining Workstream. Learning she had the option to limit an applicant’s ability to schedule their own interviews until after a manager gets a chance to review their resume is yet another game-changer for Sandi. It’s this ability for customization that assures the team they’ve found their HR solution. See how Workstream can help you manage and pay your hourly workforce",

    "text": "Going digital: How this Jimmy John's group saves hours on hiring each week When the executive vice president of a multi-location Jimmy John’s franchisee realized their administrative challenges were slowing them down, she went on the hunt for the right HR tech. With Workstream, they streamlined their hiring process, reducing time spent on weekly hiring tasks from four hours to as little as 30 minutes. \"For us, Workstream just really closed the gap between how hard the applicant has to work to get this job. Because if they have to work too hard, we know they’ll work somewhere else.\" Deb Merrill Executive VP over Jimmy John's franchise group The problem Piles of paperwork slow down hiring and onboarding About Jimmy John's Jimmy John's is a well-known American fast-food chain famous for its sandwiches, speedy delivery, and emphasis on fresh ingredients. It has grown into a significant player in the fast-food industry with numerous franchise locations across the United States. Locations: ~2,745 Industry: Restaurants Employees: ~45,000 As executive vice president of an ownership group that operates 12 Jimmy John’s franchises, Deb Merrill often has to wear several hats. On a daily basis, she oversees HR tasks, payroll, and safety enforcement. Across all these operational duties, Deb was spending several hours each week. In addition to Deb’s time, her area managers were spending hours auditing their GMs’ work, and GMs were spending time auditing their assistant managers’ work. Hiring was a costly process; adding up to 20 or 30 hours of work per Jimmy John’s location each week. The culprit? All of 12 restaurants were still managing hiring manually on physical paper. This meant using reams of paper for printing their new hire packets, employee handbook updates, or job applications. Without an online application method, her team had to make sure that each item of paperwork was filled out completely by hand—and any delays gathering this information meant delays in new hire starts. the solution Digitizing processes to save time Deb decided to try Workstream. However, switching to a digital onboarding solution wasn’t an easy decision. In the past, she’d tried other tools which proved too difficult for her managers to figure out. “It ended up being more effort for me, more work—I still had to collect the physical documents as backup because nothing was completed,” Deb says. But not with Workstream. Onboarding Unlike the other HR systems she’d tried, Workstream proved virtually painless. “It took me about a day to get all of my documents ready for Workstream. And maybe about a day for everybody else to get trained on it. The first payroll that we did where everyone was using it for their onboarding was the easiest payroll I ever had. It was all worth it to learn Workstream.” Document and Signature Management She’s also excited about their upcoming employee handbook update. What was once an annual event that involved printing and distributing over 200 handbooks to be individually signed and returned, is now a quick text and digital signature. Another manual process Workstream simplified and made online for Deb. “I’m very excited about this.” Hiring Applicants love it too. When looking for jobs at one of Deb’s Jimmy John’s restaurants, applicants can now apply via text message. and get a response instead of coming into the store. And when they get hired, they can even complete their onboarding paperwork over the phone. 87.5% less time spent on hiring tasks built for the hourly workforce Feeling freaky fast Gone are the days of having new hires stop by to fill out a 25-page booklet or come back whenever an item is missing in their onboarding paperwork. Instead of dedicating up to four hours each week to hiring tasks, Deb now spends maybe 30 to 60 minutes. And she’s not the only one impressed by Workstream. “My managers are happier. They’re spending more time making sandwiches than being focused on payroll or HR items and less time being upset.” Now that Deb can see how quickly her managers contact and respond back to job seekers, she feels she’s optimized the applicant experience.

    "text": "How a Zaxby's franchisee saw a 500% increase in applicants with Workstream Needing to get his 14 Zaxby’s locations fully staffed, franchise owner Ben Little turned to Workstream. Thanks to its digital processes and automated workflows, Ben was able to streamline the hiring process for his managers, enabling them to improve the applicant experience. “You’re going to save a ton of money and streamline the entire process. Your hiring managers are going to love you … it’s just a no-brainer.” Ben Little Chief Operating Officer, 14 Zaxby's locations The problem Low applicant volume made hiring feel impossible About Zaxby's Zaxby’s is an American QSR chain offering chicken wings, chicken fingers, sandwiches, and salads. They operate primarily in the southern United States and are mostly owned by franchisees. Locations: ~900 Industry: Restaurants Ben initially relied primarily on individual job posting sites for his sourcing needs and encountered several issues. Postings got expensive quickly, easily costing up to tens of thousands of dollars a month. And with free job sites, it was not unusual to get less than 20 applicants a month, which was not going to cut it when he had 14 restaurants to staff. With so few applications coming in, his hiring managers often missed notifications—and potentially good applicants. It didn’t help that the application process was long with plenty of forms and details to fill in, which deterred younger applicants with shorter attention spans. To try to get more applicants in the door, hiring managers were constantly following up through phone calls, only to get ghosted when it came time for the interview. Ben and his team had accepted that this was just the way hiring would be: a numbers game where the objective was to get as many people to respond to them as possible in hopes that a few would stay engaged long enough to get hired. The solution Smarter sourcing and automation increase applications Streamlining the hiring process for both applicants and managers has had a big impact on Ben’s restaurants. With Workstream, they saw a 500% increase in applicants, improving their chances of hiring quality workers. Sourcing tools Sourcing is also less time-consuming. Workstream enables Ben’s team to manage all their job postings across different sites in one easy-to-use dashboard. They can even sponsor posts without ever leaving Workstream. Text-based hiring When hiring managers previously reached out to applicants, their calls would appear as unknown numbers, reducing the likelihood that applicants would answer. However, with Workstream, applicants receive text messages through the application link and are more likely to respond. It also provides greater convenience when rescheduling or providing more information about the job. Automatic scheduling Workstream enables applicants to schedule their own interviews via text based on the hiring managers’ availability. Ben’s team has seen the difference this makes when hiring younger applicants who prefer text messaging to phone calls. By automating interview scheduling, more applicants are coming in for interviews than ever before. 500% increase in applicant volume built for the hourly workforce An intuitive and streamlined hiring process Now, hiring managers save time on making phone calls and securing applicants and can spend more time focusing on things that matter, such as improving the applicant and employee experience. By embracing technology to streamline hiring processes and prioritize applicant experience, Ben has not only overcome challenges of low applicant numbers and high turnover rates but has also positioned his restaurants for sustained growth and success, becoming some of the top performing Zaxby's restaurants in the country.

    "text": "Hiring your way: How a Burger King franchise group got 10x more interviews Viking Restaurants, a Burger King franchise group, was struggling to get applicants to staff its 26 restaurants. By customizing the hiring process, embracing mobile, and implementing self-scheduling with Workstream, they experienced a 10x increase in interview completion rates. “For us to be as successful as possible, we need the best possible employees that we can get. Workstream allows us the ability to get better employees. That’s been a success for everyone.” Troy Hennen Director of Operations, Viking Restaurants The problem An application dry spell leads to poor customer service About Viking Restaurants Founded in 1954, Burger King is the second-largest fast-food hamburger chain in the world. Home of the iconic flame-grilled Whopper, the brand is known for its commitment to premium ingredients, signature recipes, and family-friendly dining experiences. Viking Restaurants is a growing franchise group with more than 26 Burger King restaurants in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. They’ve been serving high-quality food with outstanding guest service since 2006. Locations: 26+ Industry: Restaurants Employees: ~600 Today’s QSR industry continues to face a nationwide labor shortage, which makes it challenging to find and retain qualified employees. Steve Prow, a District Manager who oversees five of the 26 Burger King franchises for Viking Restaurants, understands this challenge better than most. One of his Burger King locations hadn’t been fully staffed for almost two and a half years. In a 12-month period, that particular restaurant would only receive a total of 40 applications—not all of them qualified applicants. Setting up interviews was another challenge. Al Martinson, Operations Support, was spending too much time reaching out to applicants for managerial roles. “Nobody answers their phones today, so I would wait for a callback. Sometimes we’d connect. I’d suggest the time, and they might come back and say ‘That won’t work.’“ As staffing struggled, so did customer service. the solution Customization and automation to the rescue Sensing their existing applicant system might be part of the problem, Al and his team made the decision to try Workstream. Almost immediately, restaurant managers noticed a change for the better in every aspect of the hiring process—including the number of interviews completed. Customizable hiring “One of the things we use in our ad slogan is ‘live life your way’ tied in with the ‘have it your way’ message of Burger King. And this applicant system really allows the candidate to apply in a way they want to, set their own interview schedule, and it’s really allowing them to do it their way,” Al says. Workstream made it possible for his team to customize their applications to their needs. In this instance, making the form easy and simple enough to complete everything on their phones. Automated scheduling “It all starts with the first impression,” Steve notes. “Our managers know when the interviews are coming, and we schedule for that time. In the past, maybe somebody showed up for an interview, and we didn’t plan for it. Then it’s maybe, ‘I’ll get to you when I can.’ So we didn’t start off on the right foot. By having my managers set the times they know when interviews are going to be, we do a much better job of being organized and showing them we’re a good company to work for.” Troy Hennen, Director of Operations says, “All that time not spent having to look at applications to call somebody, but letting our applicants set up their own interviews is a financial savings.” 10x more interviews on average built for the hourly workforce A better experience for managers and applicants alike Since using Workstream, Burger King locations throughout their franchise group are completing 10X more interviews on average. With managers getting a text every time that somebody applies, response time is almost immediate—ensuring a great applicant experience at the start. Once the franchise group switches to its new payroll system, Workstream will play a big role in collecting employee paperwork, sharing documents, and simplifying the onboarding process.

Best regards, <Sender's Name> Conducting performance reviews Checking in with your employees on a regular cadence is essential to resolving issues early and increasing retention. Performance reviews also provide an opportunity to recognize the work of high performers and give guidance to under-performers. Follow these checklists to make sure you’re ready to have productive check-ins with your team. Before the meeting Outline an agenda and schedule enough meeting time to cover all topics Ask employee to complete a self-evaluation (optional) Review employee's self-evaluation (optional) and job description Review employee's performance targets Gather your thoughts and all the data to meaningfully discuss: The goals and objectives of the review Employee’s performance over the past X months (what was done right / what can be done better), particularly as it relates to goals set during the last review New goals and targets Career development aspiration During the meeting Give the employee context on what the goal/purpose of the employee review is Start the conversation on common ground by reviewing the employee’s responsibilities together Discuss the progress they’ve made toward their goals and assessment of competencies Discuss potential roadblocks or undocumented contributions by employee, asking the employee for input and insight Discuss and get aligned around what the next phase of goals will be Ask the employee about their career aspirations and outline a plan for working toward it Thank them for their contributions and for being on the team Set up another meeting if there is insufficient time After the meeting Modify or update performance review based on conversation Finalize and sign employee performance form Run through final performance form with employee and obtain their signature Keep reading to learn how to best support high-performing and under-performing team members.' , High-performing employees Take a look at their self-evaluation (if you had them complete one) Make note of how they view their own performance Have they identified any struggles you should address? Recognize their effort and work related to their responsibilities Call out moments they’ve gone above and beyond their responsibilities Discuss ways they can grow Ask about their professional goals and if there are any roadblocks or additional resources they may need to be successful Set new targets based on previous performance ⭐ Tip: Let this be a discussion. Allow your employee to suggest targets too! Wrap up Congratulate them on their performance and encourage them to keep up the good work Under-performing employees Take a look at their self-evaluation (if you had them complete one) Take note of how they view their own performance Have they identified any struggles you should address? Bring up potential areas of improvement Create a list of items you’d like to discuss Frame your feedback as what can be done to improve rather than weaknesses or deficiencies Be direct (but kind) rather than generic Make it a dialogue between the two of you vs. just talking at your employee. Ask them questions. Seek context. Give the employee time to absorb what they heard Acknowledge the areas where they performed well Offer help and advice Share personal experiences where possible. This allows feedback to be more authentic and meaningful and conveys empathy Don’t be mean. Your goal is to help them improve, so show you care and guide them in the right direction Wrap up Set realistic goals they can work on Reinforce that while there are things that need to be worked on, learning is part of the journey and you’re here to help Surprising and delighting employees A little recognition goes a long way in making your employees feel appreciated and proud to work for you. Tying rewards to milestones like anniversaries or good performance reviews is a great way to ensure you’re consistently showing your team some love. But we also recommend throwing in surprises here and there to delight employees when they least expect it. And remember, recognition doesn’t always need a price tag. Work your way through this checklist to reward your team in new ways all year round. Milestone rewards Take a moment to celebrate your employees’ birthdays and work anniversaries Gift card to their favorite store or restaurant Movie tickets The day off Special treats like cake Celebratory lunch Performance rewards Acknowledge great performance, whether that’s during a performance review cycle, or a standout moment when employees go above and beyond Donate to their favorite cause in their name Give them some extra company swag Custom trophy or plaque (This is a fun way to award an Employee of the Month too!) Bonus Shoutouts on your social media pages or company-wide emails Team and peer rewards Celebrating as a team is a great way to build camaraderie. Celebrate great teamwork at least once a year Give the team new swag Do an offsite activity together like a night of bowling, group lunch, or tour of a local attraction Take a wellness class together, live or virtual Participate in a charity activity together Learn a new skill or hobby together like pottery or origami Acknowledge special occasions and holidays, especially if your team has to work during them Bring in treats Decorate your business Host a team party Encourage employees to dress up their uniform to match the occasion Implement a peer recognition program Enable employees to vote on who is the Employee of the Month Create a space for employees to shoutout each other whether it’s on paper or during team meetings Surprise rewards Find opportunities to surprise and delight your employees at least twice a year. It’s often enough that it doesn’t feel rare, but not so often that it loses its impact. Bring in treats Give employees new swag Set up an at-work scavenger hunt for employees to discover throughout the day (This could be as simple as hiding gold coins on St. Patrick’s Day.) Your business relies on the strength, health, and happiness of your people Managers juggle a lot. But when it comes to how you manage prospective and current employees, you can never drop the ball. Each interaction is an opportunity to attract an employee to your business or reinstate an employee’s loyalty to where they work.

    "text": "THE HOURLY WAGE INDEX How much should you pay your hourly workers? The wage wars rage on. With 3.5 million open hourly jobs in the U.S., employers are competing more than ever to attract applicants—and how much you're willing to pay could be your advantage. Discover how your pay practices stack up against other regions, positions, and industries. Wages aren’t everything! While pay is one of the main factors that hourly employees consider when choosing to join (or stay at) a company, it’s not the end all be all. Research shows that advancement opportunities, supportive management, and schedule flexibility are all incredibly important as well. Want to learn more about this trend? We dive deep into the data behind which perks and benefits matter most to hourly workers. Check out our full conversation with expert Sara Wasserteil of Cara Collective. Frequently asked questions What is the difference between gross wages and net wages? It's important to remember that the Hourly Wage Index data above reflects gross wages, or the amount of money an employee earns before accounting for payroll deductions like taxes, benefits, or wage garnishments. Due to variability in tax rates across locations, slightly lower gross wages in a certain location might result in higher take home pay, or vice versa. What is a good hourly wage? This question is a difficult one to answer, as a \"good hourly wage\" is highly subjective according to experience, work responsibilities, cost of living, and other factors. We recommend using Hourly Wage Index data as a starting point. Once you have established a baseline for certain positions, do further research into similar businesses in your area. Lastly, consider surveying your employees. They're the best resource to help you know what is a good hourly wage, what competitive pay looks like in your location, and how competitive wages change in your industry over time. Offering competitive pay is one of my top priorities—what other resources do you have that might help? We know that getting applicants to pay attention to your business can be extremely challenging, and that offering competitive pay is a huge part of that. Wages aren’t everything, however! Applicant experience is another important factor that can help set you apart from your competition.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Franchise HR tech 01/15/25 Serving the hourly workforce: A guide to compliance Share this article I’ll venture to guess that the driving force behind your decision to own or operate your business was not a passion for regulation. Managing hourly workers brings unique challenges, particularly when it comes to compliance. You have to navigate a complex set of federal, state, and local labor laws, and you do so while trying to keep your primary focus on operating your business successfully. It’s also not a stretch to assume that you are committed to the well-being and overall job satisfaction of your hourly workers. After all, you chose a “people business”: one that puts the service your team provides to your customers at the center of your success.  Compliance isn’t just about avoiding fines—it’s about creating a workplace that is fair, transparent, and safe. So, what are the most common compliance issues we face, and how can we protect our business and our workers? Common hourly compliance challenges Minimum wage and overtime rules Compliance with minimum wage and overtime laws is a fundamental requirement for employers of hourly workers. These rules vary by state, with some jurisdictions setting higher minimum wages or additional overtime regulations than federal standards. Employers must stay up to date on local laws to avoid costly fines, wage disputes, and reputational damage. Look up your state's labor laws here . Recordkeeping in line with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) The FLSA mandates that employers maintain accurate records of employees’ hours, wages, and other key employment details. Non-compliance in recordkeeping can lead to penalties and audits. Employers must ensure that their systems for tracking time and pay are thorough, transparent, and accessible for regulatory review. Worker classification as exempt or independent contractor Improper classification of workers as exempt or independent contractors instead of non-exempt employees is a common compliance issue. Misclassification can result in significant liability for unpaid overtime, taxes, and benefits. Employers must understand both federal and state laws to ensure workers are classified correctly. Break and rest periods Break and rest period laws vary widely across states, with California having particularly detailed requirements. Employers must be vigilant in providing mandatory meal and rest breaks, tracking when workers take those breaks, and compensating employees when breaks are not provided. Failure to adhere to these rules can lead to penalties and class-action lawsuits. Off-the-clock rules Employers are required to pay hourly workers for all time spent performing job-related tasks, including pre-shift or post-shift activities. Common violations include not compensating employees for time spent setting up equipment, cleaning workspaces, or attending mandatory meetings outside of regular hours. Strict policies and training managers to adhere to the policies are necessary to ensure all time worked is documented and paid appropriately. How the right technology makes compliance easier It’s normal to get frustrated.  We invest time and money to make sure we’re doing the right thing for our business and our hourly workers, and yet we live in fear that small, unintentional errors can have big consequences.  My experience, though, is that good technology can not only save time and expense but also alleviate anxiety and empower us to focus on the reasons we chose this business in the first place. Stay on top of hours and breaks with a proactive time clock tool Recently, I led the business transformation of Wise Sons Jewish Delicatessen in the San Francisco Bay Area. We urgently needed to reduce overhead expenses, and one of the highest-impact moves was to implement time and attendance technology. The result was a double-win: a big reduction in administrative work at the corporate office (we no longer needed to fill an open position!) and easier, more accurate tracking of hours, breaks, and shifts for payroll. A modern, digital time clock can make a world of difference when it comes to reducing errors and staying compliant with labor laws. Look for a time clock solution that automatically flags discrepancies, such as missed punches or overtime, and geofencing features that prevent buddy punching of offsite clock-ins. This can save you from the hassle of manually reviewing and correcting errors, ensuring your records are accurate and payroll-ready. Be vigilant about overtime hours and scheduling Schedules aren’t static. I ran a large Jamba franchise group, and the smoothie business is the most weather-driven category I’ve ever seen. It’s impossible to forecast your guest traffic for the next two weeks because the weather forecast can change so quickly.  We often found ourselves updating the forecast not only for tomorrow but for this afternoon!  It was essential that we had a nimble scheduling system that enabled us to make changes and still remain compliant with work rules. A strong scheduling tool should also help you maintain compliance with labor laws and avoid costly mistakes. It should track employee hours in real-time, identifying when workers approach or exceed the overtime threshold, and automatically calculate overtime pay according to federal, state, or local regulations. Customizable overtime rules are key, allowing businesses to align schedules with specific laws, such as daily overtime or holiday pay requirements. Alerts and flags for overtime shifts give managers the chance to adjust schedules or redistribute hours to prevent violations. Additionally, detailed reporting provides insights into overtime trends, helping businesses optimize schedules and stay audit-ready. Have a secure source of truth There’s a saying I’ve heard from HR leaders through the years: “If it’s not documented, it didn’t happen.”  You’ve provided all the right policies, procedures, and forms.  You’ve handled performance matters with sensitivity and care.  You’ve facilitated employee terminations to the spirit and letter of the law.  But can you prove it? The unfortunate reality of our business climate is that sometimes we DO need to prove it in order to protect our balance sheets. A secure and efficient system for managing worker records , documents, and e-signatures is essential for maintaining compliance in hourly businesses. The best tools offer centralized, encrypted storage to keep sensitive employee information safe while allowing you to control access based on user permissions. These systems should support quick imports and exports, real-time updates, and seamless access from any device, including mobile, making it easy to manage data wherever you are. Digital document and e-signature tools further streamline compliance by enabling you to assign and collect essential acknowledgments, such as onboarding paperwork, policy updates, or offboarding forms. This ensures that key documents are signed and stored securely, providing an audit trail for compliance purposes. By replacing costly and inefficient paper processes, these tools help you maintain accurate, organized records while saving time and reducing errors. Final thought This year, I connected with Nadeem Bajwa, Co-founder & CEO of Bajco Group.  Among his many businesses are over 250 Papa Johns restaurants .  Nadeem shared some wisdom that I come back to when I feel discouraged by challenges in our industry: Essentially, we’re all playing by the same rules. The same government requirements. The same compliance guardrails.  I can whine about it all I want, but every bit of energy I put into complaining could instead be invested in problem-solving. With the right technology, risk management doesn’t have to be daunting and scary; it can be streamlined and automated. In fact, I can give myself a competitive advantage and a greater chance of success.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 02/24/25 How to avoid a communication breakdown with your hourly workers Share this article In any workplace, good communication is the key to a smooth operation. But when you're managing hourly workers, staying connected comes with its own set of challenges. Between changing schedules, shift swaps, and the fast pace of the job, keeping everyone informed and engaged isn’t always easy. Let's take a look at some common communication mistakes hourly business owners and managers make and help you avoid them so your team feels heard, supported, and ready to do their best work. 1. Ditch the outdated communication methods Email might work for corporate offices, but for hourly workers who are always on the move, it’s not the best way to get urgent updates across. Relying solely on emails, printed schedules, or bulletin board notices can leave employees out of the loop and frustrated. Instead, embrace messaging platforms that make communication instant and easy. Whether it’s shift reminders, schedule changes, or quick team check-ins, tools like mobile-friendly apps or text-based notifications help keep everyone on the same page. Just make sure there are clear guidelines about professional messaging so work doesn’t blend too much into personal time. 2. Be proactive If you’re only addressing issues when employees bring them up, you’re missing out on opportunities to improve workplace morale and efficiency. Many hourly workers might not feel comfortable voicing concerns or giving feedback unless they’re asked directly. Proactively checking in—whether through one-on-one chats, team meetings, or quick pulse surveys —makes a big difference. It helps build trust and gives you real-time insights into what’s working (and what’s not) in your workplace. The more you show you’re open to feedback, the more engaged your team will be. 3. Don't use a one-size-fits-all approach Not everyone communicates the same way. Some team members prefer a quick text, while others appreciate a face-to-face conversation. If you’re only using one method to communicate with your team , you could be missing out on more effective ways to connect. Take the time to learn your employees’ communication preferences and adapt where possible. Offering a mix of communication channels—like messaging apps for quick updates and in-person meetings for bigger discussions—ensures that everyone stays informed in a way that works for them. 4. Set clear expectations Few things frustrate employees more than unclear job expectations. If your team doesn’t know exactly what’s expected of them—whether it’s daily responsibilities, performance standards, or workplace policies—it can lead to confusion, mistakes, and unnecessary stress. Make sure job descriptions are clear from the start, provide specific instructions when assigning tasks, and check in regularly to reinforce expectations. A quick “Hey, just checking in—any questions about the new process?” can go a long way in keeping everyone on track. 5. Watch for non-verbal communication Communication isn’t just about what you say—it’s also about how you say it. Your tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language can all influence how messages are received. For example, a rushed or distracted tone during a check-in might make an employee feel like their concerns aren’t important. Similarly, crossed arms or lack of eye contact could unintentionally signal frustration. Paying attention to these non-verbal cues—and encouraging your team to do the same—can prevent miscommunication and strengthen relationships. 6. Create feedback loops Your team has valuable insights, but if there’s no system in place for them to share their thoughts, you’re missing out on ways to improve operations. Employees who feel like their feedback doesn’t matter are less likely to stay engaged or bring up concerns. Make it easy for employees to share feedback—whether through regular surveys , suggestion boxes, or just casual conversations. And don’t just collect feedback—act on it! When employees see their ideas being implemented, it reinforces that their voices matter, which leads to a stronger, more motivated team. Better communication, better workplace Hourly workers are the backbone of your business, and how you communicate with them can make all the difference. By avoiding these common mistakes, you can build a culture of trust, respect, and open communication that keeps your team engaged and your business running smoothly. Prioritize clear and timely communication, listen actively, and make adjustments based on employee needs. When your team feels informed and valued, they’ll be more motivated to do great work—and that benefits everyone.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter Hourly business trends 12/23/24 From delivery driver to 250+ units: Growth lessons from a top Papa Johns franchisee Share this article When I first started as a delivery driver at Papa Johns, I never imagined I would one day oversee more than 250 locations (with more on the way). Starting behind the wheel gave me a unique perspective on restaurant operations. I saw firsthand the challenges our team members faced, from managing phone orders while making pizzas to juggling customer service responsibilities. This ground-level experience proved invaluable as I climbed the ranks and eventually became a franchisee. My journey has taught me countless lessons about operational efficiency and smart growth, and I'm excited to share three of these lessons with you today. 1. Embrace innovation during crisis During the unique challenges of 2020, I noticed our in-store staff struggling to balance multiple responsibilities and still delivering the high level of customer service I dedicated to providing. After exploring a handful of solutions, I established a centralized call center—a decision that transformed our operations. Not only did this improve our customer service, but it also led to larger ticket sizes as our dedicated call center staff could focus entirely on customer interactions. This experience reinforced the fact that challenges bring with them the opportunity for innovation and that you have the potential to come out the other end stronger. This philosophy is one I recommend to all business owners since obstacles are endless, and so are the opportunities they bring. 2. Technology is an investment in the future When it comes to adopting technology, I've learned that newer isn't always better. Adaptability, however, is crucial. I look for platforms that have the ability to grow and evolve with my business needs rather than legacy systems that tend to be obdurate. By selecting technology partners looking to grow alongside my business, it gives me the opportunity to help shape the features and functionality I need. This symbiotic approach serves to increase the value of the technology I’m using and ends up benefiting other business owners as well. I approach technology investments a little differently than many of my peers. Rather than focusing solely on immediate ROI, I see business technology as an investment in our future, similar to insurance. This mindset has helped us build a more resilient operation. 3. Prioritize efficiency—especially for management In the QSR industry, time is precious. That applies double to managers, who consistently run out of hours in the day to check everything off their list. This truism inspired me to prioritize administrative efficiency in our processes and technology. By lessening the burden on managers, we can allow them to focus on what truly matters—our customers and team members. Freeing up time for our managers also equips them to better respond to all those unexpected challenges that arise in the QSR space. You are putting them in the position to be proactive rather than reactive. Always look ahead As I continue progressing toward my goal of becoming the first Papa Johns franchisee to reach 500 locations, I'm constantly evaluating new ways to improve our operations. Automation, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies present exciting opportunities for our industry. To those looking to succeed in the QSR space, I offer one final piece of advice: remain open-minded. Success in today's market requires more than just great food—it demands a willingness to embrace change and continuously improve. That guiding principle has served me well throughout my journey. TAGS Hourly business trends Nadeem Bajwa Nadeem Bajwa is one of the most significant franchisees within the Papa Johns network. Bajwa's journey, starting as a delivery driver, to becoming a stakeholder in the Papa Johns franchise network, speaks to his operational acumen and strategic vision, having built his first Papa Johns location 22 years ago and now scaling to own over 250+ locations. With extensive experience in expanding restaurant operations and adopting new technologies to enhance guest experience & look for ways to drive efficiencies not only for his operations, but for the broader QSR community as well.

That’s why Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting matters. Starting January 1, 2024, many businesses, especially small and medium-sized ones, must report details about their beneficial owners to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) under the Corporate Transparency Act. This might not sound like a big deal, but the stakes are high: fines, penalties, or even criminal charges for non-compliance. For business owners managing an hourly workforce, this adds yet another administrative task to an already long list. If you’re juggling payroll, scheduling, and compliance, adding BOI reporting might feel overwhelming. But it doesn’t have to be. Let’s break it all down—what BOI reporting is, why it’s required, and how you can submit your information quickly and easily, ensuring you meet the January 1, 2025 deadline and avoid unnecessary stress. Let’s tackle this together and keep your business running smoothly. What is BOI reporting? BOI reporting is a new requirement from FinCEN aimed at increasing transparency and reducing financial crimes like money laundering. It requires certain businesses to submit details about their beneficial owners —individuals who: Own or control at least 25% of the company , or Have substantial influence over company decisions. If you’ve ever wondered, “Who’s really in charge?” BOI reporting makes that answer crystal clear. Why BOI reporting matters Failing to file on time can result in steep penalties, including fines of up to $500 per day for noncompliance. While that’s a strong motivator, completing your BOI filing on time also gives you peace of mind. Early compliance helps you avoid the year-end scramble, ensuring you’re not juggling this alongside payroll, scheduling, and other responsibilities. Who needs to file? Most businesses structured as corporations, LLCs, or similar entities are required to file. However, there are 23 exemptions, including large operating companies (with more than 20 employees and over $5 million in annual revenue) and sole proprietorships. If you’re unsure about your filing status, review the BOI Compliance Guide for clarity. Step-by-step guide to BOI reporting 1. Gather the essentials BOI filing requires detailed information about both your business and its beneficial owners: For your business : Name, address, EIN (Employer Identification Number). For beneficial owners : Full name, birth date, residential address, and a government-issued ID (e.g., driver’s license or passport). Organizing this information ahead of time will make filing faster and smoother. 2. Determine if you’re exempt Not all businesses need to file.

With over 70 million hourly workers representing 60% of the U.S. workforce, the insights shared have never been more relevant. The inaugural On the Clock Summit in San Francisco, CA For those who weren’t able to attend, we’ve collected four highlights for you! 1. Recognize the unique challenges of the hourly workforce Workstream CEO Desmond Lim opened the summit by emphasizing the distinct nature of managing hourly workers: \"This space is very tough to manage. There’s a very high turnover rate; people may speak Spanish or Chinese.\" As business owners and managers in the hourly space can attest, traditional management approaches often don't work quite as well for hourly workers. These workers aren’t behind a desk, they’re often multilingual, and their work can easily vary from week to week. Businesses need to make use of specialized tools and strategies to meet their unique needs. Tip: Invest in systems and processes specifically designed for hourly workforce management rather than trying to adapt corporate tools to fit hourly worker needs. 2. Create clear paths for career advancement Julia Stewart, Former Chair & CEO of Dine Brands Global and Current Founder & CEO Alurx, Inc., shared a powerful insight about employee retention : \"The number one reason [for turnover] is 'I don't have a clue how to get promoted here.'\" She described seeing one restaurant chain transform its workforce by creating and communicating clear advancement paths; the result was 62% of general managers being promoted from within the organization. Tips: Develop clear job descriptions for each role level Create visible career ladders Communicate promotion criteria openly Implement regular career development conversations Desmond Lim, Co-Founder & CEO, Workstream; Mustafa Shakur, Co-President, Pure Fuel Sport, & former NBA player; Max Mullen, Co-Founder, Instacart; and Julia Stewart, Founder & CEO, Alurx Inc. & former Chair & CEO, Dine Brands Global 3. Encourage high-performing teams through purpose One of our favorite panel discussions featured Julia Stewart, Max Mullen, co-founder of Instacart, and Mustafa Shakur, co-president of Pure Fuel Sport and former NBA player. Their conversation showed that high-performing teams , whether in corporate settings or hourly work environments, share common characteristics: A clear sense of purpose Strong accountability (both individual and team) Regular recognition Alignment on goals and mission As Max noted, \"Everybody likes to be recognized for doing a good job... having really clear standards and recognizing people for going above and beyond... reinforces your company's values and mission.\" Tips: Create regular recognition programs Connect daily tasks to the larger company mission Celebrate team and individual achievements Lei Xu, Co-Founder & CSO, Workstream 4. Prioritize what matters In the quick-service restaurant space especially, workers face endless demands. With so many priorities competing for attention, it can be easy to lose sight of the things that matter most. And while technology and other tools have the potential to help the situation, the wrong technology can quickly become a distraction. Nadeem Bajwa, CEO of Bajco Group, explained how he maintains a balance. “When we hire people, we don't train [managers] to be good at using technology. We see if they have a passion for serving the customer and making a good product. If they have a passion to win and make money for us—that's where we look at.” Tips: Determine the number one priority for your company and workers. If you’re a QSR, they are probably similar to Nadeem’s: customer service, good quality, and passion Align with all leaders in your organization on these non-negotiable priorities Reinforce these priorities in all communication with your team, and proactively look for areas to improve Camelia Coupal, Co-Founder, Coupa Cafe; Michael Harley, Director of Operations, Golden Ticket Cinemas; and Nadeem Bajwa, CEO, Bajco Group The inaugural On the Clock Summit was inspirational, motivating, and fun! It was a privilege to bring so many leaders together in one place, united by mission. As Desmond noted, \"We are all here because of a shared passion for this hourly workforce. Hourly workers are truly the core... they do the work every single day.\" TAGS Company news Hourly business trends Workstream Workstream is the leading HR, Payroll, and Hiring platform for the hourly workforce.

This makes sense: every hourly worker is a human being with a unique set of experiences, needs, demands on their time, passions, interests, and strengths. Yet, hiring programs cannot be so personalized. Particularly in the hourly workforce space, with constant high turnover, we need more workers, and we need them now. So, we end up in a steady pattern of filling vacant roles. If it feels like your business spends more time hiring than it does serving customers, you are not alone. The monthly turnover rate for QSRs jumped from 135% in 2019 to 144% in 2021 to 150% in 2024. That means for every 10 people on staff, more than 15 people leave the team each month . And it’s harder than ever to fill those jobs: There are 70% more job openings in 2021 than before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 10% fewer people are looking to fill those jobs. Plus, the entry-level workforce now has more options than ever before, with a nearly threefold increase in gig work and logistics jobs (such as warehouse and delivery work) It’s a small wonder that our traditional hiring practices are struggling to find—let alone retain—quality hourly workers. Fewer workers for more jobs in more fields means that businesses are competing with each other to woo the attention, interest, and dedication of the available workforce. Any of us who have experienced a dip in hiring quality and quantity understand the pain points of working understaffed with constant turnover. Those pain points hit the pocketbook, too. Employee churn costs money both in hiring/recruiting costs and in lost productivity. Wondering just how much? The National Restaurant Association estimates the cost at $2,000 per employee. The restaurant research firm TDn2K calculates it higher—$2,100 to $2,800. Even using a lower-end number, that average turnover rate is costing you $28,000 each month for every 10 positions you have on staff. If you have more employees—which you undoubtedly do—you can do the math: It’s expensive. And this isn’t even getting into the intangibles—how is the customer experience impacted by employee turnover, operating understaffed, and limited resources being spent on hiring? What about the company’s reputation with potential future workers? These concerns are practically universal with any company in the hourly workforce space. Put them all together, and they illustrate why businesses with a fluctuating workforce are shifting their hiring practices: They must do so to remain competitive—even to survive. A sound and sustainable hiring strategy keeps your locations fully staffed by hiring proactively and anticipating the churn. It engages your hourly workers and meets their needs, keeping them on board and reducing the need to hire in the first place. It also advances the presence of your brand, building a reputation within your community among both customers and potential team members. This guide presents actionable insights and practices for developing a strong hiring program personalized to your brand and your current position. After all, hiring and retaining great hourly workers may be statistically tougher than ever—but all of us who enter this space relish a good challenge—especially when meeting it head-on sets us up for continued growth and success. Evaluating and evolving your hiring strategy according to your needs To build out and improve your hiring strategy, you need to understand thoroughly where you stand right now. You likely have a clear picture of your P&L, but what about your hiring strategy? Is it articulated in any formal, documented way? Or is it more reactionary, hiring as-needed for vacant or understaffed roles? Whether you’ve formalized your hiring strategy or not, it’s actually a complex combination of many factors. We recommend assessing these aspects of your hiring experience, from top to bottom, as best you can: Where are you sourcing applicants? (Job boards and career fairs—which ones? Employee referrals and word-of-mouth? Walk-ins? Social media?) Where did you source your best and/or longest-tenured hourly workers? Which channels are providing you with the best cultural fits? How much are you spending on advertising and promotion for hiring? Where are you spending it, and how does that correlate to the success of those hires? What is your churn rate? How many positions do you have at full staffing levels, and how often are you hiring for them? How often are you operating at full staffing levels, and how often (and to what extent) are you operating understaffed? What trends do you see over time for applicant flow, hiring rate, and retention rate? How have your staffing needs evolved over time? How have your hiring practices correlated with your business's financial successes or struggles? It’s key to dig in deep enough to find the actual answers to these questions—not simply the answers you think or believe to be true. You might presume your new hires are coming predominantly from job postings when they are actually coming from employee referrals . Or maybe you’ll find that your churn rate is different than you anticipated—and perhaps, for better or for worse, it’s driven by particular factors in your operations. You can also conduct more qualitative research into these questions. Talk to your team members— hourly workers and supervisors—and ask for their experiences, both in their own hiring process and in their time with the company. Their perspectives might shed insight into your hiring practices and tell the stories that numbers can’t about the human elements behind the numbers. Get clear on where you want to go Once you understand where your business stands, you can formulate where you want to go. What are your business goals? Often, people express these in terms of gross sales or net profit, but you might have other quantifiable goals—to double your franchise locations in five years, to be the top-selling QSR in your neighborhood, or to be able to donate a million dollars a year to local nonprofits. Accounting for how your business is doing right now, where you want to go, and when you want to get there, you can develop a staffing plan to understand how many people you’ll need to help you attain those goals. One piece of advice: The restaurant industry is not an end-goal game. Rather than setting one-time goals by themselves (such as “This location will make a million dollars”), set rolling goals that can help you meet and exceed those goals (such as “This location will net $50,000 a quarter”). To help you get there, you can even take more fixed goals, like doubling your number of franchises, and break them into improvement markers at your current locations. This will set your business up for sustained success, and it will also help you staff to plan. Adjust your strategy to get where you want to go Once you have that clear sense of how to evolve your business, you’ll also have a sense of your gaps—and the future needs you’ll meet to fill them. How many people do you need, in what roles, to get where you want to go? And how do you need to build your hiring strategy to meet those needs on an ongoing, rolling basis? Understand your general staffing needs You can assess and estimate your staffing needs going forward in several ways: Staffing ratios rely on the rule-of-thumb method to estimate staffing needs according to organizational structure. Let’s say your ideal setup is five FTE hourly workers on the floor for every manager. Short-term, you’ll need to maintain that number of workers for optimal operations. Long-term, if you’re expanding, you know you’ll need to plan on hiring five more staffers for each manager you add or promote. This strategy works well if you’re maintaining the same operational structure. Productivity ratios estimate how much product or customer throughput your team can handle per person. Then, you can apply that estimate to sales forecasts or growth goals to determine your hiring needs. A QSR that sells 10,000 sandwiches a month, with five hourly workers on the floor at any point, can anticipate needing to hire five more staffers to reach 20,000 sandwiches a month—or maintain those staffing levels to hold steady at 10,000 sandwiches. Get flexible with a dynamic hiring plan Of course, how often do things go according to plan? And when is the restaurant world ever a perfectly insulated environment where your ratios remain static and always effective? No straightforward business forecast or staffing plan will go as anticipated. So, it’s critical to focus instead on being adaptable. A simple way to do this is to be proactive instead of reactive. As one of our Workstream customers once said: “You need to start hiring today for the roles you’ll need filled three months from now.” Let’s use those hypothetical five FTE workers per manager again. You want to maintain that ratio, but let’s say that historically, you need to rehire for three of those hourly positions each quarter. Rather than reacting to a vacant role by hiring, you can anticipate that hiring need by planning to hire one hourly worker a month on a rolling basis. Yes, sometimes this will result in having six workers to schedule for shifts—and playing the numbers, you’ll still sometimes be a worker down. However, the staffing will stay more reliable, keeping the customer experience smooth and preventing much of the lost business cost of an understaffed team. The hiring growth to business benchmarks If you’re taking a growth mindset to get where you want to go, you can also set benchmarks for hiring additional hourly workers and scaling out the organizational structure. The productivity ratio described above is not always predictive—meaning doubling your workforce may not automatically double your throughput. You need to hire more people when the growth is ready to happen, more than the other way around. To do so, you can tie your hiring strategy to financial, commercial, or other benchmarks. For instance, you might hire another manager only after your store sees X% increase in sales or customer visits. Or, rather than setting a date to sign up for another franchise, you decide to do so only after your existing location maintains a certain sales figure for Y months. Define your plan Ultimately, evaluating and developing your growth strategy will require you to customize everything to your own circumstances. After all, there’s no magic ratio for maximizing staffing to profit. And you might have other aspects of the customer experience that determine your staffing needs—the speed of service, the number of locations, expanded hours, community outreach, and involvement. But no matter your targets and your goals, building this hiring strategy requires more than simply hiring more hourly workers. You need to hire people in progressive steps, with dynamic flexibility, to take that growth incrementally in a meaningful, sustainable way. Consider these key points when building out your adaptable hiring plan to get where you want your business to go: How many hourly workers and in what roles do you need to reach your goals? When do you need them, when will they be most impactful, and when can you best afford them? How much of this can you realistically attain through hiring? How much can you realistically attain by reducing churn? What roles do you need to backfill? Based on your historical churn data, how often do you need to fill them? How can you address this need with a rolling hiring strategy? What new roles or skills do you need to onboard to maintain the status quo or to scale up your current operations and to evolve and propel your business further? At what point do you need them—and when can you hire for them? How can you modernize your scheduling and staffing practices to maximize the potential of your workforce in terms of both their productivity and their satisfaction with your company? Historically, how much has hiring cost you—both in direct costs (job boards, hiring managers, etc.) and in indirect costs (lost productivity from being understaffed, managers focused on hiring instead of serving customers, etc.)? How much time has it historically taken your company to fill vacant roles? What other resources are you dedicating to hiring, onboarding, and retaining hourly workers? The honest, thorough answers to these questions will help you clearly understand the tools and support you may need— and those you already have—as you build out your workforce. The rest of this guide will steer you to the best practices for creating a sustainable hiring program you can adapt to your own evolving, growing enterprise. Attracting and sourcing applicants There is no shortage of specialized ways to attract and source job applicants—but all of them fall into one of two camps: inbound recruiting and outbound hiring. If you understand the differences between them—and why they both matter to a successful and sustainable hiring strategy—you can put the actual practices in a better context. The quick version? Inbound recruiting , or passive hiring, is the method of attracting potential candidates to your business. You put out honey, and the bees will come to you. Outbound recruiting , or active hiring, is when a business goes on the search for potential candidates. You bring honey with you, and you offer it to the bees. Now, honey is an apt image because all hourly workers take jobs to meet certain needs. An income is the obvious one, but candidates have other needs that your company might match: a particular benefits package , a strong community culture, or opportunities for career growth. Inbound hiring strategies broadcast those aspects of your organization—the flavor of your honey, if you will— on an ongoing basis to build brand awareness. The idea is that potential hourly workers will like what they see over time, and the right ones will decide they want to work with you. These long-term strategies are based on the premise that you will always need to seek out new team members, which is particularly true in the QSR space. Outbound hiring strategies are more immediate. If you need to fill a particular role, and you announce hiring for that role, or you recruit specific individuals suited to that position, you’re using active hiring practices. You’ll still use your company culture and benefits as incentives, but your goal is to get them to apply for that job—not to sell them on your company. The simplest way to picture this is the classic sign-in-the-window . If it’s hanging all the time with a message about “Come work with us!” that’s more inbound. If it’s hanging on an as-needed basis and advertises “Hiring Line Cooks and Shift Managers,” it’s more outbound. QSRs traditionally conduct more outbound hiring practices, particularly because of their standard turnover rate and entry-level positions. But relying on these as the primary driver for applications limits your flow of candidates. Incorporating both inbound and outbound marketing and recruitment practices will create a more sustainable rolling hiring strategy, which can be used in any of the following strategies. Develop and promote your brand and culture Your company culture is a critical part of sourcing the best-fit candidates. More than one-third of hourly workers find culture to be very important. Candidates like to know what they’re applying for— beyond a wage . If you stand apart from your competitors and appeal to your applicants, you will succeed in hiring. But culture is one of those hard-to-define and even harder-to-explain concepts. So, how do you translate the on-the-job experience to a pool of potential employees? And how does it impact your hiring results? Relaying the culture of your organization means telling the story of your company—not in the “we were founded 50 years ago” sense, but in the “here’s what it’s like to work with us” sense. So branding your culture relies on that old storytellers’ maxim: Show, don’t tell . Here’s what that means in practice. You can tell applicants that your workplace is fun. Or, you can show them pictures of hourly workers having a good time—you can show them a video that walks through a typical day in the life, and you can show other employees describing what it’s like to work together. To show off your brand’s culture, ask yourself (and your team!) questions like, “Why would a motivated person feel drawn to work for this business?” and “Why do our most dedicated hourly workers continue to work with us?” The answers to those questions can form the basis for how you show off your restaurant. The culture you promote can go beyond the daily experiences of hourly workers—it can also dig into the shared ethos of the organization. What are your company's shared values, goals, attitudes, and practices? Candidates who jive with those core tenets of your business are more likely to apply for jobs—and to stick with them once they’re hired. Finally, the branding and the culture need to complement each other. Whether your workplace is friendly, formal, casual, or businesslike, everything from your social media to your job postings can reflect that tone. This practice of promoting your brand and culture extends through all the other practices you incorporate into your overall hiring strategy. Build a branded career page A branded career page on your website is one of the first places to implement your culture. Think of this as the one-stop shop for anyone interested in working with your company. Imagine someone telling you about this great clothing company. They think you’d look great in their clothes. Instead of running straight to the store, you’re likely to check out their online presence, where you’ll get a sense of the brand’s vibe and style. That’s exactly what a branded career page does for your hiring process—and for potential candidates. After all, candidates are 1.8x more likely to apply for a job if the company is familiar to them. To accomplish this familiarity, your career page should: Share the company’s story by providing genuine photos and videos (NOT stock imagery or footage), employee-created content, employee testimonials and messaging tailored to your culture. Reach the right candidates by creating content and job descriptions for the applicants you want—which can go so far as personalizing content based on what’s relevant to them. Drive applications by helping candidates to self-select whether they are a good fit for your company, culture, and available positions. Remember, too, that a career page is about more than just the content—it’s also about the feel of the content. Everything from your color scheme to your font choices, the accessibility of the layout, and the functionality of the page reflect your business’s values and attitude. Candidates will have an experience with this page that will shape their impression of your entire business, and it will be a major factor in deciding whether they want to work with you. Use diverse job board platforms Some strategies are tried-and-true because they work. There’s a reason businesses still put “now hiring” signs in the window, after all. And certain online boards, like Monster.com, are here to stay. But more avenues for hiring exist now than ever before. You should use as many of these job boards as reasonably possible so that you’re not missing out on all the new applicants turning to these new and diverse channels. Not only are you losing out on some top candidates with your absence, but they are going to work for your competitors instead. It’s also important to maximize your time and efforts. Posting job openings on multiple platforms can consume all of a hiring manager’s time, not to mention handling all the incoming applications and inquiries. You can reach a wider audience of potential candidates with exponentially less effort on your end by using platforms that automate this process . Involve your current hourly workers Your current hourly workers are your single greatest recruitment resource. Third-party endorsements, such as your employees’ positive comments, add depth to your business’s credibility. Their testimonials, photos, and videos on your career page will do more to advocate for your company than any marketing-speak you can dream up. Starbucks’ careers page on Instagram (@starbucksjobs) is one great example of incorporating current hourly workers into a hiring strategy. Beyond their expert ways of broadcasting their culture through concise copy and wordplay, they have an abundance of employee portrayals on their feed . This inclusion offers prospective hires a glimpse into how their work lives could look if they only applied to one of the many Starbucks locations. In the next couple of sections, we’ll look at ways to incorporate your hourly workers into a hiring strategy through referral programs and (like Starbucks) through social media engagement. Incentivize referral programs When current hourly workers recommend friends and family to work for you, that is more effective than any job posting. Think about it: Wouldn’t you be most likely to suggest a workplace to your best friends if you enjoy working there yourself? You might be benefitting from organic referrals from your employees already. Great. But you can increase your reach simply by incentivizing team members to send more candidates your way. (For example, you might pay a referring employee $300 for each referral that is hired and stays on for 60 days.) Your culture might shape how you build and implement these incentives. And they will be worthwhile investments—even beyond the costs of hiring. Because of that personalized recommendation from someone who experiences your company culture, referred candidates are more likely to fit right into it . Chances are that the referred candidates will only apply if they are attracted to your company culture in the first place. Plus, employees who suit the culture tend to have higher levels of satisfaction and are more likely to stick with the company longer. This is also an opportunity for you to level up your current referral program . One possibility is to automate the program, making it easier for current team members to share job opportunities with their networks. Leveraging this kind of technology will enable your team to reach a larger audience of quality candidates more quickly and easily. Learn the powers of different social media platforms Social media platforms allow you to enact inbound and outbound hiring practices all at once. Your posts are a stellar way to engage customers and potential employees —who are most likely already customers. A truly engaging social media presence is itself a branding tool: look no further than Wendy’s willingness to roast anyone and everyone on Twitter, and you’ll understand the power of an active account. However you implement social media, remember that people generally like lighthearted and interactive brands . Your presence will cultivate your audience’s expectations of what it’s like to work with you. And remember to strike a balance between posting consistently (whether that’s daily or weekly) without veering into spamming your audience or posting uninteresting, valueless content just for the sake of posting. Here are some tips for applying hiring strategies to some of the more popular social media platforms: Instagram Instagram is known for its aesthetically pleasing feed and its image-driven posts. Accounts succeed with engaging visual content, more so than with text (although text incorporated into visuals can be an effective tool): Keep the creative content consistent with your branding—in visual style as well as in attitude and tone. Use striking colors and designs that will catch the eye in a feed full of outstanding imagery. Rely on simple infographics and punchy text to convey messages to your viewers. Opt for minimalism over excess. Instagram also offers tools to boost the visibility of your content: Instagram Stories are temporary posts and are, therefore, excellent for on-demand and urgent hiring needs. It’s more acceptable to post more often to Stories than on your regular feed, which can come across as spamming your followers. IGTV allows you to post videos and animated graphics, with or without sound, affording you additional ways to engage viewers and develop your brand presence. X (Formerly Twitter) X is popular for finding jobs: 58% of job seekers use X in their search. It’s a particularly applicable tool for hiring in the 25-34-year-old demographic, which accounts for almost 30% of Twitter’s users. X is predominantly known for its 280-character limit that drives concise and to-the-point posts, with liberal use of hashtags to filter tweets on particular topics. (This is where Wendy’s thrives; its infamous roasts are the epitome of pithy.) Images, videos, and links can also help convey your message and draw attention to your tweets. The reply and retweet features also enable you to build threads of information, such as all the perks of employment or a how-to on applying. They are also great ways to incorporate employee experiences into your feed. Chick-fil-A, for instance, retweets videos and photos of their employees at work and their accomplishments. This shows off the culture for prospective candidates and rewards hourly workers for their efforts. Tiktok This video platform has quickly become one of Gen Z’s most highly used apps. It’s known for sharing quick, humorous videos and spreading viral challenges—but TikTok has also recently launched a pilot program to connect job seekers and employers using the #TikTokResumes hashtag. Users can submit video resumes using the app, providing an alternative to traditional application procedures—particularly beneficial for younger workers, who may not have much experience but can show off their personality. From the hiring perspective, such TikTok engagement strategies help you learn more about candidates before actually meeting in an interview. Using TikTok also increases your brand awareness and broadcasts your hiring campaigns to more people—a nice combination of inbound and outbound recruitment. And it’s effective. Chipotle saw a 7% increase in the number of applicants after posting recruitment videos. Their content was entertaining, humorous, and engaging enough to reach a wider audience as part of their campaign to hire 10,000 new employees. Facebook The mother of all social media platforms, Facebook is perhaps less cutting-edge than the other popular apps. That said, it is multifunctional. You can set Instagram to automatically repost to your company’s Facebook page, and you can repurpose tweets and TikToks there as well. It’s generally a good idea to have a Facebook page for your company —even for each location in a franchise, with location and contact information and site-specific hiring announcements. Facebook has also adopted certain tools similar to other platforms, such as Stories that mirror Instagram’s. Diversify your team Diversity is a nice thing to aim for—but that’s not why you should aim for it. Diversity in your workforce attained through a conscientious hiring practice, can make your team more versatile, more creative, and more relatable to customers. Think about it: you have a diverse customer base. That’s likely true in terms of age, ethnic background, gender identity, and socioeconomic status. The more your team behind the counter reflects the customers in front of it, the more your employees will be able to relate to customer needs and desires. They’ll share similar experiences and backgrounds. And this is true for more than just hourly workers. If your hiring manager and your marketer reflect different aspects of your customer base, for example, they’ll be better able to develop an effective hiring campaign that speaks more directly to the community. Forbes furthers this idea that diverse groups of people also tend to make better decisions. They point University of Michigan professor and social scientist Scott Page, who—in his book The Diversity Bonus— attributes this gain to cognitively diverse groups (which is affected by how people identify with different groups) thinking differently than more homogeneous teams. Forbes also points to IMF managing director Christine Lagarde and what she calls a “larger horizon” when gender diversity creates this same bonus. She describes how banks with women in top leadership roles tend to sport stronger fiscal profiles and lower consumer risks— yet despite this benefit, women comprise a mere 2% of bank CEOs and 20% of their boards. Or, we can think of it much more simply: the more diverse the perspectives on your team, the more potential you have on board for ideas, skills, and experiences that will improve your organization. Recruit nontraditional workers This is an offshoot of diversifying your team: Hiring nontraditional workers depends on who exactly the traditional workers are in your industry. But, in general, it means being open to offering jobs to people with experiences outside your industry—experiences that can prove valuable to your team, even if they come from atypical directions. A pool of candidates that is often under-tapped consists of people with criminal backgrounds . Many communities offer programs to help one-time inmates reintegrate into the world and fill job positions in the labor market. The United States has 19 million people with felony convictions, and the biases around those convictions can make it very difficult to find meaningful employment—no matter how excellent they would be at it. Furthermore, nearly 700,000 people are released from prison each year—and offering them a chance at employment opens this deep pool of candidates. It also helps improve diversity in your team because a disproportionate number of incarcerated people are people of color. You can find nontraditional workers using other methods, as well. If your industry tends to employ teenagers, look at older adults. If it tends to employ college graduates, look for nongraduates with a track record of meaningful work. Whatever ways you expand your recruitment reach, always recognize that non-traditional employees face non-traditional challenges. They may lack some of the experience or skills the job requires. These hourly workers may require a sound onboarding and training program, as well as coaching and support throughout their employment. In return, many of these employees will turn out to be your longest-tenured because you gave them a shot when no one else would. Hire both internally and externally The debate between hiring in-house hourly workers for other roles and hiring outside candidates is often framed as a build-or-buy conundrum. Do you build up from within or “buy” from outside the company? A comprehensive, sustainable hiring program requires you to think more about build- and -buy. Internal hires have an understanding of what the hourly workers are doing and experiencing. They also understand your culture and see how you’ve invested in and believed in them. Promoting from within tends to be faster and less costly, as well. But external hires have benefits too; namely, you can draw from a much larger pool of applicants. These candidates might have more experience in the particular role you’re filling, especially if it’s a supervisory or skilled position. However, they will need to learn the culture as they go. “Cultural fit is the most important factor when you are considering hiring somebody externally,” explained Roger Ahlfeld, vice president of human resources for Tedeschi Food Shops in Rockland, Massachusetts. “When you promote people internally, one of the biggest advantages is that they already know how to work in the environment.” In the QSR space, many hourly workers are external hires simply because these are fairly entry-level positions. You might hire within to fill other hourly positions, though—say if a cook has an interest in moving to a front-of-house role. Supervisory positions or skilled roles, such as GMs, hiring managers, or marketers, can happen either way. Although there is no simple solution to knowing whether external or internal hiring is the right course of action, SHRM offers some general guidance to consider: When to consider looking externally: Tough corporate turnarounds or strategy shifts are underway. Performance reviews on current employees are inconsistent or nonexistent. Specific skills are needed that are not readily available within the organization. The organizational culture needs an injection of multiple perspectives. Processes are in place that support job training and full integration into a position. When to consider looking internally: An organization is thriving. Performance reviews are consistent and transparent. An abundance of company- or industry-specific skills are required for the job. It may be hard to understand or fit in with a unique and strong organizational culture. No or few processes are in place to support job training and integration into a position. Engaging applicants with speed and ease In traditional hiring practices, the human element is the limiting factor: How many applications can one prospective hourly worker complete? And how many applicants can one hiring manager review, sort, contact, schedule for interviews, and make decisions on? Let’s face it: Hourly workers are in demand, and QSRs are competing against each other for them. Hiring hourly workers is all about speed. And you need to engage them first. Each pause in the application process improves the chance that a quality candidate will get an interview or an offer from your competitor, removing them from your pool. And the employer with the more engaging process is more likely to win the competition for the applicant’s attention. Being the first to offer applicants a position doesn’t guarantee they’ll take it—but it certainly increases the chance they’ll accept. You’re a sure thing at that point, and your speed shows your interest in them. Plus, a faster, more efficient, and more engaging hiring process lands you the better candidates—and it streamlines the process for your managers, maximizing their time and effort, minimizing the applicants who ghost them, and freeing them up to focus more on the restaurant’s countless other needs. Paper applications, back-and-forth phone calls—these are relics. You can use better ways to engage applicants and find the best ones for your team. Make the process seamless for applicants Ghosting isn’t just for dating anymore—it’s becoming common practice for job seekers to go cold and quit communicating with potential employers (and even with their new jobs). According to Indeed, 28% of applicants ghosted a workplace in 2020. While employers can’t counter every possible reason for ghosting, they certainly can make the application process as seamless as possible. Seamless—and really quite quick and easy. After all, it’s a lot harder to ghost a hiring manager who’s communicating with you than one who’s leaving you hanging. And the secret weapon for engaging prospective applicants is already in your pocket. Text message communication is your best friend Text messaging is perhaps the single most powerful tool for improving the applicant experience . It’s more than convenient: It’s the preference for the largely millennial and Gen Z workforce. Three-quarters of millennials choose text messages over phone calls, and prospective hourly workers who receive text messages rate their experience 50% higher than candidates who don’t. Sure, texting can feel casual to many of us who didn’t necessarily grow up with it. But it’s the best way to communicate with most of today’s hourly workers. It is convenient for both you and them—and in today’s world, it’s also a sign of respect for the applicant’s time and schedule. A phone call demands an immediate response: answer or ignore. A text message allows an applicant to read and respond when they can focus on it. Texting is also your best bet to be noticed: Text messages have a 90% open rate, largely read within the first three minutes. Plus, texts see 18x the response rate of emails. So even if your hiring system relies on email communication, it can behoove you to follow up on email correspondence with a text message nudge to check their inbox. And best of all? You can lean on texting for every stage of the hiring process. Simplify—and speed up—the application process Most QSRs have moved some or all of their job applications online. Good. But as simple as it is to type in your home page, navigate the menu to the hiring section, and identify the location you’re applying for ... that’s asking a lot, relatively speaking, of your prospective applicants. Put another way: It’s not how they’re already using their phones. Make the process as quick as possible for them. Use text-to-apply features in your job postings (which you can use to send a direct link to the application or even to initiate a quick application-by-text). Alternatively, you can use QR codes the same way—just scan and boom! They’re applying to work at your restaurant. Similarly, keep the job application as brief as possible. If candidates have to go digging for information, a percentage won’t come back—but you can once again use texts to remind them to continue their unfinished applications. Get creative with finding the right fit The problem with a quick application—from the hiring manager’s perspective, anyway—is the lack of information. So use text messaging (and all its app-based cousins) to engage your applicants while getting to know them better. Many such ideas in this vein use video, a la Snapchat. Brands such as A&W ask people to send in short video resumes or to film responses to certain application and pre-interview questions. These allow job seekers to show off their personalities in ways that might be more natural or comfortable than written answers— and certainly more insightful than answering yes/no questions. Similarly, you can engage with applicants by sending them videos or interactive media about your workplace, your benefits, your culture. The possibilities here are endless—but each of these ideas helps to screen prospective candidates before even getting to the interview stage. If an applicant is likely to ghost, they’re less likely to send you a video response to your questions. And if an applicant shines on screen more than on a written resume? Now you know. Plus, you can do all of this directly in a text message thread—or use texts to send direct links to where the information needs to go and to acknowledge that you’ve received what they’ve sent. Schedule interviews In our own stress to find quality candidates, we sometimes forget that the process is stressful for them, too. Choosing to schedule interviews by text instead of calling can allow candidates to put themselves in the right headspace. And—we can’t stress this enough—if you’re conducting the interview itself by phone or video, schedule it ahead of time by text rather than simply calling to talk spontaneously. They can refresh their memory about the role since they’ve likely applied for multiple jobs. They’ll then be able to perform at their best during the interview. As a bonus, because you’ve already opened the door to texting, they’ll feel able to contact you instantly if the need arises before or after the interview. Say they’re having technical difficulties, or a doctor’s appointment ran long, or your hiring manager doesn’t show. They can text you to check in rather than leaving anyone hanging. Follow best practices for engaging by text Just because text messaging is simple and relatively informal, don’t make the mistake of thinking it’s casual and easy. Texting comes with its own best practices, just like any tool, and here are our recommendations: Ask candidates for their permission . Unsolicited texts can feel invasive or unwanted. So let applicants tell you what they prefer. After all, they’re the ones making first contact through an application. Include a quick section for candidates to mark their preference for communication, be that text or email (or even a phone call). ID yourself and use a work phone . Anytime you initiate text contact, lead with your name, your position, and your company. That tells recipients your message is not spam, and it offers them context for who’s communicating. And by using a work phone, you keep a healthy boundary between your work and your personal life (not to mention not giving your personal number to strangers). Keep it professional . Of course, your text message can be friendly—and if your branding is more casual, you can tailor the formality of your messages to match. But it’s essential to convey professionalism by, for example, using complete sentences and avoiding abbreviations and shorthand. Pay attention to timing—and be timely . Your initial contact should always come during regular business hours (unless the candidate has indicated a different preference in the application). And while you shouldn’t be expected to text outside your own working hours, if a candidate texts you back during your evening shift, by all means, respond. Prompt responses show you are motivated to work with them—and keep the hiring process speedy. Automate to save time and maximize effort All this seamless application stuff sounds great for applicants. But what about for GMs and hiring managers? Isn’t asking them to spend their days texting candidates just one more responsibility on their plate? It would be if it weren’t so straightforward to automate. The more you can incorporate a system that automates the application and interview process, the more you can maximize your hiring team’s efforts. Take a look at NRD Capital, a prominent middle market private equity firm that counts Fuzzy’s Taco Shop and Frisch’s among its holdings. Using a text-automated hiring platform, these QSRs engage applicants as soon as they apply—and they get candidates in for interviews in less than two hours—all without requiring a moment of the GM’s focus. “We were losing on hiring because we didn’t respond to applicants fast enough,” Frisch’s COO, Darrin White, says. “Automating communication between us and the applicants increases our chances 10 to 1.” With the right automated system in place, managers won’t need to expend their efforts on non-skilled tasks that otherwise take up a ton of time—like screening applications and scheduling interviews. Of course, you can personalize your own automation system to reduce friction in the hiring process, but here are some common strategies that work: Smart screening That initial process of sifting through applications consumes a lot of time, particularly if the applicant flow is as high as most QSRs need it to be. If the application process is electronic and standardized (either by text, via the restaurant’s app, or on the website), you can set hiring parameters to screen applicants for basic requirements. That way, no one spends even a moment eliminating the non-qualified applications. More advanced hiring technologies can also help you assess the quality of applications before progressing them to the interview stage. We talked about some of these in the sections above—examples include asking applicants to upload a short video introducing themselves. Thus, smart screening takes two basic forms: information gathering to see if candidates meet your basic requirements and personalized responses to engage applicants and to self-filter the ones who are less serious. Automated interview scheduling Another drain on hiring managers is the effort of making back-and-forth calls and texts just to schedule a single interview. Imagine if every applicant who passes the smart screening didn’t have to wait for a follow-up to schedule an interview—but instead had the option to self-schedule immediately after applying. An automated hiring platform can provide permission-based calendar access to promising candidates so they can schedule an interview with you or your hiring managers during the times you’ve marked as available. The applicants get an immediate confirmation text, and the hiring manager receives a notification that an interview is scheduled. This is how QSRs like Fuzzy’s and Frisch’s schedule applicants in less than two hours. It’s as close to instantaneous as it gets—and it’s how you can get applicants in the door (or on the phone) for interviews without a single moment of logistics work on the manager’s end. Text confirmations Even with the fast-as-it-gets process, managers still risk no-shows for interviews. An automated system can utilize text confirmations to minimize ghosting and keep managers from sitting around waiting. With text confirmations, applicants automatically receive a text message from the hiring manager shortly before their interview, asking them to reply to confirm. If they don’t reply, managers know not to wait for them and can instead refocus their energy on the many other needs demanding their attention. And if a candidate needs to reschedule, that option can also be part of the text message. This works—Jamba, for example, recently reduced its ghosting rate by 90% by using automation and two-way texting technologies. This technology can also be employed at other points in the hiring process—text notifications can remind candidates to finish uncompleted applications, nudge them to review onboarding materials, or ask them to confirm they’ll be there for their first shift. And in that interim, between scheduling and conducting an interview, you can get applicants excited about their future careers with you by sharing digestible information about long-term growth opportunities, employee benefits, and other information about working with your organization. Preserve the personal touch “Automated,” of course, doesn’t have to mean “impersonal.” Applicants are still human beings, after all, and so are your hiring managers—and an automated system is simply a way to more efficiently get two people talking. So, it’s essential to provide your hiring managers with extra training as needed to develop their interpersonal skills. They need to be able to communicate and interact professionally in the hiring process, whether they’re crafting automated text messages, responding individually to applicants, or simply sitting down for the interview. After all, the best candidates will make their decisions largely based on their impression of the team and the company. That first impression needs to engage them and make them feel respected and valued. To that end, we recommend that hiring managers add appropriate personal touches in their communications so that applicants don’t feel like just another number. Even just using the applicant’s name at the start of correspondence can help, as can making specific positive comments on the experiences and information they share in their application. Connecting with potential team members in a personalized yet professional way increases the sense of mutual empathy between applicants and hiring managers, leading to a great applicant experience and bolstering your company’s reputation—regardless of whether you end up working together. Retaining and engaging hourly workers The greatest hiring program in the world won’t solve the workforce turnover problem on its own. The other side of a solid hiring strategy is keeping the hourly workers you already have—particularly the best ones. However, the best ones are in the highest demand, so in a nutshell, the best way to keep them with you is to keep them engaged and connected with your company. And not just with lip service, but with actual, actionable practices that demonstrate your commitment to them and appreciation for them . In other words, how can you connect with them and connect them to the good work they’re doing beyond cutting them a paycheck? The truth is that pay alone doesn’t cut it. The restaurant industry as a whole is seeing its highest quit rate in 20 years, although pay has generally increased. Employees need to feel satisfied, valued, and enriched in addition to being paid. More hourly workers are looking at other ways to reduce hiring costs and improve employee retention, even so far as converting hourly workers to career leaders. This sounds easy enough—but the how is the kicker. So, let’s presume that a competitive wage is a baseline . How else can a business differentiate itself for the sake of attracting—and retaining—its top performers? Recognize and acknowledge hourly workers We all appreciate when someone acknowledges the hard work we do. Yet we can all forget to recognize a job well done, especially when we’re facing economic, hiring, and other pressures—which, let’s face it, all of us in QSR leadership are. So, it’s helpful to ingrain a gracious working culture from the top down. This starts with owners and owner-operators flowing down to managers, supervisors, and other team members. The small things, like verbal acknowledgments, matter. These moments show your team that you recognize the positive impact they have on the business. Yet you can also go beyond the praise and acknowledgment part of recognizing employees by institutionalizing it. One strategy is to designate one or more of a team’s managers as recognition leaders . These leaders can make it a daily part of their work to acknowledge good work, whether through spoken acknowledgment of team members’ contributions or other, more tangible recognition programs . That’s an important distinction: Tangible rewards signal gratitude in ways beyond words. It’s the epitome of “put your money where your mouth is.” To prevent a sense of favoritism, these rewards can be tied to performance benchmarks. For instance, an employee who clocks in on time for X shifts in a row could be rewarded with a gift card to a store they like. You will greatly increase your ability to retain your top talent for longer by making employee recognition a priority, backing it with accountability, and pairing it with goals- or performance-based rewards programs. Pro tip: Making such rewards personal—like getting a gift card to a store they like rather than the most convenient big-box store up the road—goes even further toward making employees feel valued and appreciated. Some of the endless ideas for recognizing employees Give bonuses to celebrate specific contributions. Give end-of-year or end-of-quarter bonuses. Give bonuses for sticking it out through tough times (like a pandemic). Offer referral bonuses and perks for workers whose friends and relatives apply for jobs. Organize on-the-clock social get-togethers. Send employees home with gift cards, tickets, and other experiences. Lead with empathy Of course, a gift card every day won’t be enough to overcome a poor manager/employee relationship. With so few distinctions between hourly wage jobs, one of the top reasons employees leave a job is because of their boss—which is why you should place importance on how managers and supervisors treat team members . Leaders are the first touchpoint for keeping good employees and reducing turnover, which is why how they treat employees is key. (That need has gotten even greater, too—85% of HR leaders agree that demonstrating empathy is even more important post-COVID than it was before.) All leaders in an organization can work (and even take training) to improve how they demonstrate empathy with their teams: Making a reasonable, professional effort to get to know hourly workers improves the personal connection they have with their workday. (And it’s a great way to learn which store’s gift card they would love best.) Treating employees with sensitivity and understanding lets them know you take them seriously—even when you can’t accommodate their requests. For instance, sitting down for a one-on-one with an employee and doing so in a timely fashion after they make a request shows that they have your full attention. Training managers and other leaders to see employees as equal people, rather than subordinate drones, helps them offer direction and guidance rather than issuing orders. It also helps managers work to employees’ strengths and preferences rather than treating staff as interchangeable components. Training can also help leadership understand their own implicit biases toward multilingual employees , who make up a significant portion of the hourly workforce, thereby making sure that they are given the same considerations and opportunities as all other employees. All too often, empathy is a hollow buzzword in business circles—or else code for connecting with customers and their dollars. But when hourly workers are treated genuinely, empathy can build personal rapport between management and other team members, which will ultimately reduce turnover. After all, people want to work where they feel valued. Support hourly workers Of course, hourly workers take jobs because they need an income. But every job offers money. You can differentiate your organization and retain your employees by providing meaningful support that reaches beyond a competitive hourly wage. Supporting your team is in many ways like supporting your friends or family members. This kind of support matters , and you can’t apply a blanket approach to every situation. Many companies now create personalizable support benefits so that employees can tap into what they need and want when they need and want it. Personalizing employee support also helps them feel seen. The awareness of providing support and its availability strengthens your team’s connection to the company. And personalization goes both ways—you can personalize your support to jive with both your means and your culture, in addition to what speaks to your hourly workers. This section offers many ideas and suggestions for support options, broken down into broad categories. But it’s in no way comprehensive. You can be creative in bolstering your workforce, so long as the support is genuine and it genuinely acknowledges your employees’ needs . Provide comprehensive benefits Most hourly workers don’t receive benefits from their employers. Yet the idea of comprehensive benefits is not new or innovative. It’s well-established that workers will choose and stick with jobs that provide healthcare benefits, particularly compared to similar jobs that don’t. It’s a basic strategy for attracting and retaining quality workers—one that is only lightly used with an hourly workforce. But hourly workers also make decisions based on how well that coverage suits them: more than half of adults report that their satisfaction with health benefits is a key factor in keeping their current role—and that was before a global pandemic that conceivably could increase that number. And comprehensive benefit possibilities extend beyond healthcare coverage to retirement, emergency support funds, and even education reimbursement. Starbucks experiences a 65% turnover rate—essentially half that of the QSR average—and a big factor is its comprehensive benefits package, through which every eligible U.S. employee, regardless of full- or part-time status, receives complete tuition coverage for a bachelor’s degree through Arizona State University’s online program. And Ben & Jerry’s offers the Core Academy, a series of free online courses. Yes, these efforts cost money. But so does a high turnover rate. It’s worth exploring various traditional benefit programs to see which ones will help your organization retain its best hourly workers for longer—preserving institutional knowledge, reducing onboarding and ramping up expenses—and drawing in the best candidates right from the start. Prioritize hourly workers' needs According to McDonald’s EVP and Chief Global Impact Officer, the top reason hourly workers leave their jobs is a lack of sufficient childcare. This is all the more significant because parents account for more than one-third of the food service workforce. Employers can retain more than one-third of their hourly workers by providing better access to childcare: flexible scheduling, for example, or a childcare stipend. Employees have all kinds of needs. And they are more likely to stick with a company that goes the extra mile to understand those needs and then shows its appreciation by providing resources to help them. Sure, it might feel good to get movie tickets in appreciation for a job well done—but what about impactful programs that make the job possible in the first place? These possibilities are boundless. Imagine a scheduling program updated in real-time that the millennial/ Gen Z workforce can access on their phones. Consider what it would take for workers to feel safe at work— from infectious diseases to aggressive customers and everything in between. Pretend you’re paying rent in your first-ever apartment, and your manager uses an on-demand pay app instead of waiting two weeks to cut you a check. Other ideas include looking at the tools hourly workers want to do their job better and how you can facilitate their professional development (say, from line cook to manager). Those things make a difference in the employee experience. They show you are invested in them and that you prioritize them—and they are more likely to invest in your company in return. Respect and enable a healthy home/work balance The phrase “time off” can carry certain connotations of a worker not working. But, of course, your hourly workers aren’t always working. They have lives and needs outside of the workplace, and today’s employees want to know you’ll have their back outside of work, too. Let’s face it: Employees who can tend to their home and personal lives will be happier, more focused hourly workers, too. This is especially true in industries like QSRs with traditionally high turnover rates, which can lead to employees working understaffed shifts, covering other shifts, and generally experiencing burnout. You can protect your employees by being intentionally mindful of how you schedule their shifts (and teaching your scheduling managers to do the same). You can even encourage them to take time off—for mental health, sure, but also just for fun. How you can level up your approach to time away from work and the quality of that time: Consider giving all hourly workers the gift of paid days off for their birthday and work anniversary. Introduce performance-based incentives with high-value returns like concert tickets or travel stipends. Parental leave and short-term disability leave are even more valuable benefits because they empower employees to care for themselves and their families without having to choose between work and wellness. Flexible scheduling, to the extent possible, enables workers to come to work when they’re most able to give their best effort. Similarly, you can accommodate the needs of all employees by allowing job-sharing and offering full-time, part-time, and as-needed schedules. Offering sick leave helps employees heal and also allows them to keep their coworkers (and customers!) healthy without feeling like their job or income is at risk. Go on the offensive If you have the above bases covered, you can go on the offensive and offer retention and engagement strategies that help your workers grow beyond meeting their needs. Many companies have started to do this through perk stipends . These are often relatively low-cost programs that enable hourly workers to improve their quality of life without impacting their hourly wage. A key strategy is that these are often a choose-your-own-adventure from a suite of options, so employees can use the benefits that are most meaningful to them. It’s fairly common practice for employers to categorize their perk stipends, like food, entertainment, or exercise, and then give hourly workers autonomy to decide how they access the resources. Some employers expand perk stipends to include psychology resources, nutrition programs, and other wellness-centered benefits. Others make the stipends available for basic resources like groceries, diapers, gas, and bus and Uber fares. Other offensive-minded strategies can include giving hourly workers increased autonomy to make decisions on daily operations, granting them permission to reward a certain number of their best customers, or, really, whatever initiatives you think will meaningfully improve your employee engagement , enjoyment, and well-being. Such offensive-minded tactics create exceptional experiences for your teams, and they actively build your culture and your reputation as thinking creatively and supporting your workers. This will improve retention and engagement and help entice new hourly workers to apply. How the best QSRs retain their hourly workers: Starbucks offers comprehensive employee benefits that include customizable personal and educational development, which is fittingly called Your Special Blend. They also provide a 401(k) retirement plan, an emergency fund, and a College Achievement Plan through Arizona State University online. Certain Jimmy John’s franchisees provide on-demand pay. Chipotle offers a debt-free education program and transparent career paths for their hourly workers (70% of their GMs started off on that track). They also grant quarterly bonuses of up to a month’s pay, as well as discretionary bonuses. All told, these initiatives have helped increase retention by 3.5x. McDonald's training is continuously updated to keep in mind the opinions of the current workforce. Workforce survey responses and hourly worker feedback allow them to incorporate certain valuable skills in their training programs. McDonald’s also increased their hourly wages to more than $13/hour. Shake Shack believes in treating everyone equally regardless of where they are from or how they look. The brand plans to boost the company’s diversity by aiming for 50% minority representation in leadership positions by 2025. They’re also working toward gender parity as part of their efforts to be more inclusive. Undoubtedly, this will retain existing hourly workers and may even increase their popularity among job seekers. Develop employees Many QSRs and other hourly employers resist investing in employee development programs. After all, for generations, these businesses have been built on an expectation of high turnover and fast training. Now that we better understand the true cost of rehiring for a role, the industry is slowly realizing that employee development is an investment rather than an expense . Employee development programs can actually lead to a long-term positive effect on the bottom line by improving retention. Most hourly workers have plans for their careers, and often, these wage jobs fill short-term needs or are stepping stones on their longer journey. So employee development isn’t something to hand out willy-nilly. Rather, it builds on the idea of empathy and connecting with team members: It’s critical for leaders to engage in conversations with employees about their career goals. These managers need the ability and the resources to connect potential long-term employees with sound career development programs. These opportunities improve the employees’ careers—and they’ll show the hourly workers that the company really cares about their professional growth. Businesses will reap dividends on these investments, as well, and not just because they will spend fewer resources on rehiring—they will also see improved performance and increased long-term institutional knowledge. Professional development doesn’t have to mean sending hourly workers to college (though it can). And unlike some educational opportunities provided by forward-thinking QSRs, it doesn’t have to be open-ended. It’s alright and sensible for the training to relate to the employee’s role (both present and future) within the business. Furthermore, attending to your hourly workers’ development creates a strong sense of loyalty. Even in highly skilled fields, like software development, employers fear that upskilling workers will just arm them to go get a better job somewhere else; and while this does happen in singular cases, that is simply not the overall result. How to implement training and development You can use, of course, many creative avenues to integrate development into an organization. Here are some high-level thoughts to get you started: Keep it fun and frequent. More than half of hourly workers believe that the most important thing about training is that it is fun and engaging. Training also results in workers feeling valued, yet 40% of them are trained only once a year or less. Engaging and continuous training keeps your team interested in their work and interested in improving at it. Make it mobile. Everything else is accessible on your phone; why not training? Making it convenient also increases the likelihood that hourly workers will utilize it. Everything from handbooks to training videos can be sent by text message or through an app. Hourly workers back this up; 70% think app-based training is easier, and 76% would feel more connected to their company if they could access communications on a device. Start at the very beginning. For instance, McDonald’s offers its coaching program to every new hourly worker, starting day one. Sure, most McDonald’s workers don’t make a career with the company. But the ones who end up with a company career start from the moment they are hired on the path to becoming a more effective future leader and contributor. Even if you do not choose that route, onboarding can set the tone for expectations and train employees to integrate into a company’s culture through the use of anything from lighthearted videos to a truly unique employee handbook.

Congratulations! You just got a new job! No matter where you’re working or whether it’s a part- or full-time position, one thing is for sure: You’re probably already anticipating that first paycheck. But before you get it, it’s important to ensure you understand what you can expect on your pay stub so there aren’t any surprises. You’ll realize that your calculated pay isn’t as simple as multiplying your hourly pay by how many hours you work. There will be taxes withheld and potential deductions that will affect the amount you receive in your check. And if you don’t know how to read your pay stub, it can be confusing to figure out how your take-home pay was actually calculated. In this article, we’ll break down the anatomy of a pay stub so you know exactly what to expect when that sweet first payday finally comes. Breaking down your pay stub First thing first: What is a pay stub? A pay stub is a document that summarizes how your earnings were distributed during a certain pay period. It typically has three parts: how much you’re getting paid, your taxes, and your deductions. In addition to personal information like your name or employee ID, your pay stub will cover a lot of important information you will want to review and retain for your records. If you regularly check your pay stubs for accuracy, you can also hold your employer accountable to ensure you’re getting paid correctly. Let’s walk through each pay stub section together. Pay period Every pay stub you receive covers a specific pay period—this could be weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly, depending on your employer’s pay schedule. The pay period shows the start and end dates for the time covered in your check. This is especially helpful if you want to verify that you’re being paid for all hours worked, including any overtime, holiday, or weekend hours. Hours worked and pay rate This section tracks all hours you’ve worked, broken down by type: regular, overtime, and any premium hours (such as holiday hours). You’ll want to check this carefully to ensure all shifts and special pay rates are recorded accurately, especially if you’re picking up extra shifts, working split shifts, or working late into the night. This section can be a good checkpoint to make sure no hours are missed. Gross pay The gross pay number is the amount you earned before any deductions or taxes were taken out. For hourly workers, there’s a lot that can go into this number. Your hours worked multiplied by your hourly rate (Note: This can vary depending on whether you worked shifts at different rates in the same pay period. For example, if you worked overtime, you want to check that those hours are calculated at the correct overtime rate.) Tips (allocated, reported, and/or pooled tips) will also appear in this section, though they may also appear in the deductions section if your employer handles tax withholdings on tips Any shift or sales bonuses You may also see an item for Minimum Wage Adjustments. This is any additional compensation provided to meet minimum wage standards Before you get too excited about this number, remember that this won’t be the amount you actually take home. Deductions The deductions category is a catch-all for anything subtracted from your gross pay. Deductions include mandatory taxes (like federal, state, and local taxes), garnishments (like child support), as well as any voluntary deductions you’ve opted into, such as health insurance, retirement contributions, or employee-funded benefits. These deductions vary greatly by employer and whether or not you work enough hours to qualify for full-time benefits. Common hourly worker-specific deductions might include: Tax withholding (Federal and State): As an hourly worker, your tax withholdings are often calculated based on each individual paycheck, meaning that varying hours and overtime can change how much is withheld from pay period to pay period. Uniform or equipment deductions: In certain industries, hourly workers may see deductions related to uniforms, tools, or other work-related items if these aren’t provided by the employer. Note: Most hourly workers should expect to fill out a W-4 form when they’re initially hired, which covers a variety of information, like if you work any other jobs. Your W-4 will directly impact the deductions taken out of your paycheck, so if you ever have any questions about what you see on your pay stub, it’s important to reach out to your company’s HR rep. It’s also good practice to revisit your W-4 each year, even if you stay at the same job, to ensure tax withholdings reflect your current financial situation. Net income (Net pay) One of the most important numbers on your pay stub is your net income or net pay. This is the amount you'll take home after all the deductions have been made. For hourly workers, net income can vary widely depending on hours worked, overtime, and deductions. Since this is the final “take-home pay” amount, it’s a good idea to review it each pay period to ensure there are no unexpected deductions and to verify that it matches the hours you worked. Year-to-date (YTD) The year-to-date amount conveys how much you have earned so far within the calendar year. You may also see this number displayed as YTD. This is helpful if you’re tracking annual earnings, aiming for a certain income target, or wanting to see how much you’ve contributed to benefits or tax deductions. For hourly workers, this number can fluctuate, especially if your hours vary from week to week, making it a good reference for tracking progress toward yearly financial goals. Sometimes, you’ll also see Accrued Paid Time Off listed in this section. This tracks accrued, used, and remaining hours for vacation, sick time, or other types of paid leave, offering a snapshot of PTO balance for hourly workers. In summary Understanding each section of your pay stub helps you stay on top of your earnings, deductions, and overall financial well-being. For hourly workers, where hours and income may fluctuate week to week, regularly reviewing your pay stub can be a powerful tool to avoid any surprises and ensure you’re getting paid accurately. By staying informed and proactive, you’re better equipped to make confident financial decisions and address any discrepancies right away. Remember, if you ever have questions about your pay, don’t hesitate to reach out to your HR representative—they’re there to help make sure everything adds up for you.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 11/06/24 Why culture matters for the hourly workforce and how tech can help Share this article There’s an insight I’ve learned from over 30 years of working with thousands of hourly employees: they have a deep and fundamental desire to succeed. Success might be as simple as a task well done, a sales target achieved, or a shift where everyone had fun serving happy guests. It could be personal success in the form of a promotion or the shared success of being on a winning team. Hourly workers come full of promise and potential.  And there’s no question that the best way we can harness that energy for everyone’s benefit is through a positive workplace culture. When our employees are engaged , they are more motivated, more loyal, and they provide better service to our customers. It’s a virtuous cycle that results in their personal growth and the growth of the business. Employee engagement affects your bottom line OK, maybe you think I’m too optimistic. Or you think, “ Sure, it’s nice that my team is having fun, but does that really get me better results? ” When I became a franchisee with restaurants in multiple districts, I saw the correlation first-hand. In the districts where employee surveys told us they felt more connected to the organization, year-over-year sales growth and OSAT (overall customer satisfaction) were consistently higher.  And my own two eyes told me that well-engaged employees offered our customers a genuine, more personalized experience. But don’t just take my word for it. A 2020 Galup study of 112,312 work units and 2.7 million employees found that teams in the top quartile of employee engagement outperform the bottom quartile by 18% in productivity, 10% in customer loyalty, and 23% in profitability. Challenges of building culture with hourly and part-time workers The reality of employing an hourly and part-time workforce is that turnover rates are higher , and frequent staff changes can disrupt team dynamics. Hourly workers often have fewer opportunities for relationship building and feedback, and part-timers may have limited overlap with their full-time teammates. Some clichés are just true: we need to meet people where they are. As a leader, I’ve had the most success by respecting the current situation of my hourly workers and finding ways to help them engage with their coworkers and participate in the company culture.  Fortunately, there are proven strategies and state-of-the-art technology to help us adapt to the lives of our employees, so let’s talk about those. Set clear goals and recognize progress Remember, our hourly workers want to succeed . It might seem obvious, but it’s important that we clearly define roles, expectations, and goals. To progress with confidence, our employees need to know they’re heading in the right direction, so give them a clear roadmap.  When you assign their primary role, explain the secondary tasks they should do when there’s downtime. If you assign them to serve customers, role-play what great service looks like in your company. If you have a sales target or a speed of service goal, make sure your employees know how they can contribute to the team’s success. And when they get it right, recognize it!  Awards and incentives can be effective, but your most powerful tool is individual feedback, especially feedback in the moment. Hearing that I’ve done something well right after I do it is priceless. With the right communication tools, giving instant feedback and praise is easier than ever. Instead of waiting until you see your employee in person—which could be days—or texting from your personal phone, which can blur professional boundaries, a modern communication tool allows you to message workers through a professional account . These tools let you send real-time feedback, share quick updates, and even encourage team connections—all without compromising privacy. When communication is easy and instant, your team stays engaged and motivated, knowing their efforts are recognized. Focus on the shift, not just the big picture When your hourly and part-time workers talk about work, it’s not about the year, or the month, or even the week.  They’re focused on the shift. So, while longer-term professional development is important, focusing on shift goals is really important to this workforce, too.  Walk them onto the shift with expectations and goals, encourage teamwork through challenges or friendly competition, and celebrate the small wins.  We want our employees to leave work with a sense of accomplishment and a positive outlook on their next shift. Automated messaging can help you rally the team before each shift, even when you’re managing multiple locations or a large workforce. Scheduling a quick “Have a great shift today!” message to send 30 minutes before each shift keeps employees motivated and prepared. Customize notifications for special occasions, like a reminder to aim for a daily sales goal or alerting them to a special promotion. These small, automated touches set the tone for the day and help keep your team focused and ready to perform. Create opportunities for feedback and ideas But maybe not everything during the shift was positive. Perhaps our employees have suggestions about what could have gone better.  Or, after a good shift, they’d like to give a shoutout to a coworker or share an idea about how to improve the business.  An engaged employee is one who feels heard and who knows their point of view is valued . Consider tools that simplify the process of collecting employee feedback by sending surveys during the critical moments of their journey. Surveys can be scheduled to reach employees right after a shift or following a specific event, ensuring feedback is relevant and timely. Surveys sent via text message make it easy for hourly workers to share their thoughts and help build an open, responsive culture where every voice counts. Your workforce is your competitive advantage One more insight. Your hourly and part-time employees can be a source of great strength for your business. With so many businesses relying on this workforce, your success in engaging them and keeping them motivated is your competitive advantage. And it has the virtue of being good for both your employees and your business. If you’re looking for that competitive edge, consider leveraging an HR platform with engagement tools that integrate seamlessly into your business. The right tools can set you up with a great foundation for building and maintaining company culture, and you can only go up from there!
