Maybe it’s because they haven’t been good team players. Perhaps it’s because they’re often in disagreement with their coworkers. It may be because of poor work ethics. All of these may be signs that you’re dealing with a difficult employee . Such situations are inevitable, and they’re fundamentally problematic as they could lead to poor team morale, conflicts and even severe disputes. In the long run, it would ultimately lead to a loss in productivity and sales, which is detrimental to your organization. Here are six tips that can guide you on how to deal with difficult employees on a professional level; which will hopefully help in solving the situation amicably and maintain the performance of the business and morale of your other employees. How to Deal With a Difficult Employee : 10 Tips 1. Remember that it's never about the person, but rather the behavior Even before you broach the matter with the employee, have a think about what you'd like to say and how to best say it. If you're overly emotional or provide feedback that sounds like a personal attack, your employee may become defensive and argumentative, which won’t help the situation. If your employee feels like they’re being ganged up on, they’ll likely also shut down, which won’t allow both of you to have a productive conversation. Your priority should be to find out why your employee is behaving the way they are, offer feedback and eventually find a common consensus. While your employee may seem unreasonable or downright stubborn, it’s important to keep the conversation rooted in facts and to not let it get off course by letting emotions take over. Go into the conversation with an open mind, and be sensitive about how you bring up the topic. Everybody makes mistakes, and they may not be aware of what they've done wrong. 2. Find out the root cause Before immediately jumping to a conclusion, try to figure out the why behind your employee’s actions. Everything happens for a reason. Could it be that they're facing trouble with a certain teammate? Are they struggling with a situation back at home? Are they generally not coping well with their workload? By having small (and often!) chats with your employees, you’ll be able to understand their circumstances. Speak to them about their current situation before bringing up their mistakes, as it could uncover underlying issues. When you get to the root of the problem, you will then be able to help them think of solutions or even resolve the problem yourself, if needed. As a manager, it’s also a good idea to set up regular catchup sessions with every team member to find out how they've been doing and if they're thriving. This will help you uncover potential problems even before they come up. 3. Provide clear and detailed feedback This is the hardest part—how to have a difficult conversation with your employee. As mentioned before, plan what you would like to say, and how you should say it. As you think about what you want to say, be sure to provide your employee with specific examples of their negative behavior , and the consequences of such behavior on their teammates, the organization and themselves. Doing so will also reduce the employee's defensiveness and give them an understanding of why it's a serious problem that needs to be fixed. During the conversation, it may be appropriate for you to give your employee feedback and guidance on how to correct their behavior. Make sure your advice is direct and to the point without sounding like it's a personal attack. If possible, work with your employee to determine an appropriate solution and game plan you can both commit to. This could be an action plan or goals that they can work towards over a period of time. Ensure that realistic standards are set, and give them time to correct their mistakes. If it helps, consider providing additional incentives or benefits that may motivate them to perform better. If your hourly employee maintains their position and shows unwillingness to change their behavior, it’s crucial to emphasize the consequences that will follow if the same issue occurs again. Make it clear that such actions are not tolerated in your organization, and that there will be repercussions if they don’t put in the effort to change for the better. 4. Be open Remember that your goal is to have a two-way conversation with your employee. This means that you should also be open to any feedback that they may have. If they bring up any workplace issues that resulted in their behavior, acknowledge and address them. Both you and your employee should make the effort to reach mutual understanding. As a manager, you will also have the authority to correct any misunderstandings, or make adjustments that the employee will otherwise have no say over. Should you need to step in to rectify the situation, please do so. 5. Keep track and document problematic behavior After an agreement has been reached, continue to document any form of problematic behavior from the employee. Take note to keep a detailed record, including the date and specific information on what occurred. This acts as evidence and serves as a good point of reference, especially in the event that the employee sues the business for wrongful termination. On a lighter note, it will also help facilitate future conversations with the employee as you have the incident recorded down, which makes it hard to rebut. These conversations could occur during their performance review , or regular catch up sessions, and can be helpful in reminding them on how they can continue to improve. 6. Conduct damage control Depending on the situation, you may need to remove the employee from the environment—separating employees who are fighting, assigning the employee a new workstation, etc.—to prevent further damage. If the challenge is that the employee lacks motivation or the right skills, consider providing them additional training, relieving them of their workload or making changes to their job description . If the employee is still not showing signs of improvement, or causes more problems, this may be a time to consider letting them go . Schedule meetings with the HR department , or your superiors to discuss how to deal with the employee, be it temporary suspension or termination. While it may not be easy to make such a decision, it may be necessary to prevent the problem from snowballing and eventually affecting the work on an organizational level. Dealing with difficult employees may be challenging, but having a great culture , empathy and mutual understanding go a long way in helping to resolve the problem amicably! 7. Involve a Mediator for Conflict Resolution In small businesses where staff members often wear multiple hats, a challenging employee can have a negative impact that reverberates through the whole team . Business owners , particularly new managers , might find themselves ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of employee behavior and performance. Enter the mediator—a neutral third-party expert skilled in defusing interpersonal conflicts and suggesting improvement plans . When an employee's bad attitude or poor performance begins to jeopardize the well-being of good employees , disciplinary action alone may not suffice. A mediator can read the body language and underlying tensions during facilitated conversations, helping to pinpoint whether personal issues from an employee’s personal life are contributing to a negative attitude at work. This nuanced understanding may be missing if business owners or managers try to resolve the issues without external help. Having this third-party perspective can also lend credibility to any steps taken afterwards, whether it's an improvement plan or more serious disciplinary action . The bottom line is that how to deal with a difficult employee is often a question without easy answers. Engaging a mediator can be an invaluable strategy, offering a timeframe for measurable changes and linking professionals through platforms like LinkedIn for ongoing support 8. Offer Professional Development as a Retention Strategy Instead of pushing problematic staff members toward the exit, consider an approach that could not only improve their performance but also turn them into assets for the rest of the team . Offering professional development opportunities can be a game-changing retention strategy that pays dividends in the long term. An effective professional development plan isn't just about enrolling an employee in a course or two. It involves a thoughtful analysis of where the employee's performance is lacking and what skills they need to improve. Human Resources usually takes the lead in identifying these areas, sometimes in consultation with other team members . By tailoring a development plan to address specific gaps, a manager shows not only the willingness to invest in the employee's future but also a commitment to evolving the skills within the team. This method serves a dual purpose. First, it improves the skill set of the challenging employee , making them more valuable to the team. Second, it signifies to the rest of the team that management is committed to growth and development for everyone. A good manager knows that how to deal with a difficult employee often involves a balanced approach that benefits both the individual and the team. By focusing on professional development, the manager turns a potential liability into an asset, ultimately enhancing the overall performance and cohesion of the team. 9. Monitor Burnout: The Silent Culprit Behind Poor Performance Burnout is an under-recognized yet pervasive issue that can disguise itself as poor performance or even disruptive behavior in the workplace. Often, what might initially appear to be a problematic employee might just be a good worker who is suffering from prolonged stress and fatigue. Employers must be vigilant in monitoring for signs of burnout, as it not only affects the individual but can also have a ripple effect on the team's overall productivity and well-being . Implementing measures like more frequent breaks can offer immediate relief. Short pauses during the workday offer employees a chance to recharge, both mentally and physically. Yet, that's just the tip of the iceberg. For a more systemic approach to combating burnout, consider incorporating stress management workshops into your team's routine. These workshops can provide essential tools for managing workload and stressors, thereby directly improving employee performance . Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) offer another layer of support. Tailored to combat burnout, these programs often provide confidential counseling services, helping employees navigate both professional and personal challenges that may contribute to their stress levels. By providing these resources, employers send a strong message: they are committed to their team's well-being and are proactive in addressing issues that impact performance and behavior. 10. Foster a Positive Workplace Culture to Encourage Better Behavior Often overlooked, the importance of a positive workplace culture cannot be overstated when it comes to dealing with difficult employees . The work environment significantly influences the behavior, productivity, and overall morale of your team. A toxic culture can exacerbate existing problems with challenging employees , while a supportive and inclusive culture can act as a buffer against conflicts and bad behavior . Fostering a positive work environment and company policy starts with leadership setting an example for the team. Whether it’s through open lines of communication, team-building activities, or providing space for employees to voice their concerns, creating a positive culture can greatly reduce instances of difficult behavior. Encourage teamwork and collaboration by recognizing the efforts and achievements of both individuals and the group as a whole. Acknowledgment of accomplishments can boost morale and job satisfaction, thereby reducing instances of poor behavior . Additionally, a welcoming and diverse environment can help build a stronger, more united team. This makes it easier to deal with individual issues, as a strong team can provide a support system for difficult people . By investing in the well-being and happiness of your employees, you’re not just solving immediate problems but also preventing future challenges and performance issues . A positive company culture can bring out the best in a difficult employee , and make your management tasks far more manageable. Wrapping Up Navigating the complexities of how to deal with a difficult employee is an inevitable yet critical aspect of leadership. Implementing the 10 strategies we've outlined can serve as your toolkit for transforming workplace dynamics. By diligently applying these measures , you're not just putting out fires in the short term; you're building a resilient, cohesive team that’s equipped to meet challenges head-on. In this way, adeptly managing difficult employees doesn't just resolve individual issues—it amplifies the strength, productivity, and morale of your entire organization.

An alarming 49% of small businesses say they have job openings they haven’t been able to fill, and 85% of small restaurant owners say hiring today is difficult. But the labor shortage isn’t just impacting small businesses. Bigger brands like Chipotle and McDonald’s have even raised their hourly wages in an attempt to attract more employees. Companies big and small are scrambling to hire, to fill shifts. And it’s stressful. For everyone. Particularly for the employees who are feeling the pressure of an understaffed team. This is especially so in fast-paced businesses that are customer-facing. The path to getting out of this bind is through hiring more employees and keeping the ones you have. Hourly workers are more inclined to change jobs whenever a better opportunity arises, so it’s important to make their current job opportunity the best one. You do that by investing in team morale. Why? Because employees with higher morale are also more loyal , which reduces the turnover rate. It also affects quality, productivity, and employee motivation—all of which are vital to a great customer experience. Without further ado, here are six ways to improve employee morale. Build a Strong Company Culture Building a strong, positive company culture is the foundation to ensuring your employees maintain high morale. While this may seem like a topic that doesn’t need to be discussed, it absolutely does. Few companies are intentional about creating a good culture, especially for hourly workers. More often than not, hourly workers do not receive the same benefits salary employees do, which leads them to feel underappreciated. Be mindful of how your benefits, perks, and employee communications impact the entire team. Creating a good culture for all of your employees—that’s visible from their first interaction with you—is an often overlooked first step. Be Transparent One of the top work values employees look for is transparency. Being transparent with your team allows you to build trust with them, which in turn helps them feel valued. Employees like to know how the business is doing, especially when it comes to business decisions or changes that affect their job. Being transparent also means that you have honest conversations with your employees, especially when it comes to difficult topics such as being laid off, something that goes hand in hand with the next point. Practice Effective Communication No one enjoys a long lecture or getting nagged at when they do something wrong. Instead, provide constructive criticism if and when their actions call for it. It’s important to let your team members know exactly where they went wrong and how they can improve themselves for the future. Additionally, avoid criticizing your employees in front of the whole team. But do commend them openly if they do something well. Doing so will improve their morale when the stress from being understaffed gets to them. Reward Employees Regularly Providing rewards for employees who perform well increases their motivation to work hard. It can also incentivize them to work toward a goal. For example, if you’re running a restaurant, consider recognizing one staff member every month as part of an ‘Employee of the Month’ program. When deciding which rewards to put in place, select ones that your employees will value most. Many of our customers make it a point to give employees rewards that the employee can use on themselves, like movie tickets, iTunes gift cards, a free hotel stay, or a day in a spa. These specific ones are great ideas because they give the employee an opportunity to enjoy time off and recharge. Keep Track of Satisfaction Levels While providing praises and rewards can improve morale, it’s still crucial for you to measure and track it. You do that by regularly asking employees for their objective satisfaction levels. Not only does this show that you care for their well-being, but it also allows you to measure the impact of new strategies you’re implementing and see which ones are moving the needle. It also allows you to know whether they’re giving their best at work. Generally, satisfied workers tend to work harder than those who are less satisfied. Remember to always review the responses you get so your employees know you’re taking action. They don’t want to feel like you’re asking for their opinions so you can cross off an item on your to-do list. Get Hands-On Your team needs more hands on deck. So, during this trying time, be present on the ground often and assist your team members whenever possible. This shows that you’re willing to go out of your way to help them and not just sit in the comforts of your office when things get hectic. How does this boost morale? Employees appreciate feeling like they work alongside you, not just for you. (Plus, the extra help to lighten their workload goes a long way.) The Return on Investing in Employee Morale Restaurants—big and small—are not exempt from the labor shortage. Boosting team morale during this time can increase your company’s retention rate, which is vital to today’s survival. Plus, improving team morale also improves their performance, which keeps customer satisfaction levels high. And, last but certainly not least, it can help you hire more employees. When potential applicants hear about the great work atmosphere you’ve created, they’ll be more inclined to apply. What to stay up to date on industry news and trends? Subscribe to our blog .

Some as a result of reactive adaptation to the current global environment. Others as an outcome of proactive innovation. All, regardless of the motivation, impacted (and continue to impact) the customer experience. In facing the challenges head-on and rising to the challenge of new opportunities, several QSR brands came out as clear leaders in customer satisfaction . Want to know which brands, and what you can learn from them to make your customers happier and grow your business? In no particular order, here are the top 5 QSR brands this year and our take on them: #1 Chick-fil-A Chick-fil-A keeps its word of providing only the best service to its customers. Ranked number one among surveyees, Chick-fil-A is most known for its fast and efficient drive-thrus . One thing that’s certain is that humans hate waiting. And that is exactly what Chick-fil-A tries to minimize to boost customer satisfaction. One of their solutions to speed up the ordering process is to have a team of servers take orders and mobile payments from cars in the drive-thru lanes. With this, customers can get in and out quickly, even with the super long queues! Chick-fil-A’s strategy to provide optimum customer service is aided by their innovation centers , where they conduct tests to maximize restaurant efficiency. This has been especially useful during the pandemic when restaurants had to change modes of taking orders to abide by new regulations. Now, as the economy begins to open up, you can look forward to the upcoming innovations this brand has brewing in their innovation labs. Tip #1: Do not keep customers waiting, and strive for fast and efficient service. Seek constant improvements through innovation to serve customers better. #2 Starbucks While other QSRs were struggling to make ends meet, Starbucks managed to successfully recover thanks to their base of loyal customers. Their rewards program, which was already popular before the pandemic, grew, even more, when it expanded the way customers can earn their rewards. Needless to say, rewards members have a higher average order value because they can redeem their “Starbucks Stars” for free beverages. What’s more, Starbucks takes their employee engagement seriously by providing them with competitive benefits, including bonuses and tuition coverage for those who want to earn a bachelor’s degree for the first time. The brand even calls their employees ‘partners’ because they believe that they have a share in the company’s success. When you keep your employees happy, they keep your customers happy. Tip #2: Loyalty is everything. Come up with an impressive loyalty program for your customers. And also, serve your customers better by implementing new ways of investing in your employees. #3 Domino’s Domino’s was one of the first concepts to enter the COVID era on solid footing by already having an established delivery system in place. What sets them apart from the rest who have rolled out new systems? Domino’s makes it easy for customers , both new and returning, to order on their website. They even took the extra step to save customer data so returning customers can automatically reorder their favorite meal whenever they open the Domino’s app. And if you don't already know, Domino’s prides themselves in their delivery that takes “30 minutes or less.” Failure to deliver within this period will result in a free pizza for the customer. Though this policy was eventually halted (for various reasons), it did make them more prominent in the pizza delivery scene. And needless to say, this attracted more customers to order from them. Tip #3: Build a loyal customer base by making it easy for customers to order. Leverage data to set your brand apart. Consider making promises you can deliver, and provide incentives if you fail to do so. #4 KFC Aside from being finger-lickin’ good, this famous fried chicken restaurant chain has been keeping their customers engaged by regularly spicing up their menu. In their most recent venture, KFC joined Popeyes, Chick-fil-A, and McDonald’s in their chicken-sandwich wars . And it proved to be quite successful. In the end, sales for their new chicken sandwich were more than 2x of their past sandwich sales. KFC also adapted their promotions according to consumer behavior. During the pandemic, their menu combos were more targeted towards individuals since most had to take their meals solo. Tip #4: Avoid sticking to the status quo. It never hurts to ride a current trend to gain more exposure. You might also want to adapt your menu offerings according to the current climate. #5 Five Guys The prices in Five Guys may not scream affordable, but when it comes to service and quality, you can count on them to deliver the best. Their menu offerings are made from fresh and quality ingredients. Even though they might be parked under the fast-food category with a simple menu, their food is comparable to those of gourmet standards. Quality food coupled with the perfect burger-joint ambiance (that is, great customer service and spectacular interior), it’s no wonder customers have no complaints about their experiences. Tip #5: Consistency is key. Customers can always expect to get the same great quality of food and service at every location. Ensure that your employees are trained well to provide consistently good service and products. Grow Your Business The QSR industry is not an easy one to venture into. With big names dominating the market, you need to make sure you’re doing everything you can to help your restaurant succeed. If you are a small business owner looking to grow your restaurant, take some pointers from the industry leaders above on how you can improve customer satisfaction.  After all, people-centric growth is the key driver to your success. Most importantly, always seek to improve your business. Innovation is everywhere and without it, even the biggest name will fall behind.

You lead a team of district managers (DMs) and general managers (GMs) in providing exemplary guest services and delivering bottom line profitability for your restaurant system. You also, and equally important, lead your team’s talent development strategy. And that’s not an easy check-the-box task. A robust talent development strategy is inclusive of your current and future employees. After all, you need a strong pipeline of available talent to keep your restaurants running. To accomplish this, you work closely with your DMs and even some of your GMs to make sure they have the resources they need to continuously bring in the best talent from their communities. To maintain a continuous stream of talent, you prioritize training your DMs and GMs on best practices for hiring. You also work with your brand’s marketing team to leverage channels (such as social media) to generate job candidate traffic. But one of the often neglected aspects of building and executing a solid hiring strategy is setting clear objectives for hiring campaigns. In this article, we breakdown how Dunkin’ successfully established and executed a clear objective in their Life Behind the Counter hiring campaign so you can get ideas on how you may want to design yours. Dunkin’s Life Behind the Counter hiring campaign Dunkin’ is a QSR franchise based in Canton, Mass., with more than 12,600 franchised restaurants in 40 countries worldwide. In 2021, the company’s franchisees needed to add 20,000 new employees to the team. To accomplish this, Dunkin’ launched their Life Behind the Counter campaign. From the outset of the campaign, Dunkin’ established the clear objective of giving potential job candidates a glimpse of what life behind the counter at Dunkin’ is like. According to Stephanie Lilak , senior vice president at Dunkin’, “We wanted to find a uniquely Dunkin’ way to provide a glimpse of what team members enjoy most about their jobs.” Dunkin’ executed on its objective by holding a series of live social media events where celebrity hosts interviewed team members around the United States to discover what makes working at Dunkin’ so fun and rewarding. Each team member was paired with a celebrity for an interview and an inside look at how they make Dunkin’s amazing beverages and baked goods. To enhance the experience (in a way still aligned with the objective), Dunkin’ gave potential job candidates an opportunity to win prizes, such as Dunkin’ backpacks filled with merchandise and accessories, at each live event. Candidates also learned about careers at Dunkin’ restaurants and how to apply. Clear objectives are the guide to hiring campaign success The Dunkin’ team knew what they wanted to do. Yes, they wanted to hire more employees—and employees who are likely to stick around longer, but they also wanted people to get an inside look at what it’s actually like to be a part of the Dunkin’ team. According to Lilak, they wanted to “show why Dunkin’ restaurants offer a great opportunity to learn skills in a welcoming environment where people feel appreciated and rewarded.” Dunkin’ realized that if they were going to succeed in attracting 20,000 new employees, they would need to show potential candidates that Dunkin’ truly cares about their team and that their team enjoys working there. By making the objective for their campaign clear, Dunkin’ was able to run the campaign successfully by combining celebrity presence, social media and a dash of positive reality behind the counter.

Register your new hire for orientation if applicable Send rejection letters to candidates who were interviewed and not selected. Rejection letter template Once you’ve made an offer to a candidate and they’ve accepted, it’s time to let the other applicants know. Rejections aren’t fun, but timely communication with applicants who’ve interviewed with you is important. It shows respect and professionalism and leaves the candidate with a good impression of your business and brand. On the following pages, we’ve also included sample rejection letters you can use as starting points when crafting your own. Important: Run your rejection letters past your HR or legal team before sending them to ensure you’re following company policy. As soon as you know the candidate isn’t suitable for your position, begin putting together the rejection letter and send it. Don’t leave anyone hanging Acknowledge their interest in the position and the time and effort they’ve put into the interview process Personalize the letter Use the person’s name and the title of the position they applied for Bring up points from their interview that reflected well on them ⭐ Optional: Include feedback Be gracious and careful so it doesn’t come off as insulting Offer to provide individual feedback and allow the candidate to follow up if they’d like to receive it ⭐ Optional: Invite them to apply again if you see potential in the candidate Review your letter before you send Is it professional? Is it concise and to the point? Did you run it by your legal and/or HR team?

Performance reviews also provide an opportunity to recognize the work of high performers and give guidance to under-performers. Follow these checklists to make sure you’re ready to have productive check-ins with your team. Before the meeting Outline an agenda and schedule enough meeting time to cover all topics Ask employee to complete a self-evaluation (optional) Review employee's self-evaluation (optional) and job description Review employee's performance targets Gather your thoughts and all the data to meaningfully discuss: The goals and objectives of the review Employee’s performance over the past X months (what was done right / what can be done better), particularly as it relates to goals set during the last review New goals and targets Career development aspiration During the meeting Give the employee context on what the goal/purpose of the employee review is Start the conversation on common ground by reviewing the employee’s responsibilities together Discuss the progress they’ve made toward their goals and assessment of competencies Discuss potential roadblocks or undocumented contributions by employee, asking the employee for input and insight Discuss and get aligned around what the next phase of goals will be Ask the employee about their career aspirations and outline a plan for working toward it Thank them for their contributions and for being on the team Set up another meeting if there is insufficient time After the meeting Modify or update performance review based on conversation Finalize and sign employee performance form Run through final performance form with employee and obtain their signature Keep reading to learn how to best support high-performing and under-performing team members.' , High-performing employees Take a look at their self-evaluation (if you had them complete one) Make note of how they view their own performance Have they identified any struggles you should address? Recognize their effort and work related to their responsibilities Call out moments they’ve gone above and beyond their responsibilities Discuss ways they can grow Ask about their professional goals and if there are any roadblocks or additional resources they may need to be successful Set new targets based on previous performance ⭐ Tip: Let this be a discussion. Allow your employee to suggest targets too! Wrap up Congratulate them on their performance and encourage them to keep up the good work Under-performing employees Take a look at their self-evaluation (if you had them complete one) Take note of how they view their own performance Have they identified any struggles you should address? Bring up potential areas of improvement Create a list of items you’d like to discuss Frame your feedback as what can be done to improve rather than weaknesses or deficiencies Be direct (but kind) rather than generic Make it a dialogue between the two of you vs. just talking at your employee. Ask them questions. Seek context. Give the employee time to absorb what they heard Acknowledge the areas where they performed well Offer help and advice Share personal experiences where possible. This allows feedback to be more authentic and meaningful and conveys empathy Don’t be mean. Your goal is to help them improve, so show you care and guide them in the right direction Wrap up Set realistic goals they can work on Reinforce that while there are things that need to be worked on, learning is part of the journey and you’re here to help Surprising and delighting employees A little recognition goes a long way in making your employees feel appreciated and proud to work for you. Tying rewards to milestones like anniversaries or good performance reviews is a great way to ensure you’re consistently showing your team some love. But we also recommend throwing in surprises here and there to delight employees when they least expect it. And remember, recognition doesn’t always need a price tag. Work your way through this checklist to reward your team in new ways all year round. Milestone rewards Take a moment to celebrate your employees’ birthdays and work anniversaries Gift card to their favorite store or restaurant Movie tickets The day off Special treats like cake Celebratory lunch Performance rewards Acknowledge great performance, whether that’s during a performance review cycle, or a standout moment when employees go above and beyond Donate to their favorite cause in their name Give them some extra company swag Custom trophy or plaque (This is a fun way to award an Employee of the Month too!) Bonus Shoutouts on your social media pages or company-wide emails Team and peer rewards Celebrating as a team is a great way to build camaraderie. Celebrate great teamwork at least once a year Give the team new swag Do an offsite activity together like a night of bowling, group lunch, or tour of a local attraction Take a wellness class together, live or virtual Participate in a charity activity together Learn a new skill or hobby together like pottery or origami Acknowledge special occasions and holidays, especially if your team has to work during them Bring in treats Decorate your business Host a team party Encourage employees to dress up their uniform to match the occasion Implement a peer recognition program Enable employees to vote on who is the Employee of the Month Create a space for employees to shoutout each other whether it’s on paper or during team meetings Surprise rewards Find opportunities to surprise and delight your employees at least twice a year. It’s often enough that it doesn’t feel rare, but not so often that it loses its impact. Bring in treats Give employees new swag Set up an at-work scavenger hunt for employees to discover throughout the day (This could be as simple as hiding gold coins on St. Patrick’s Day.) Your business relies on the strength, health, and happiness of your people Managers juggle a lot. But when it comes to how you manage prospective and current employees, you can never drop the ball. Each interaction is an opportunity to attract an employee to your business or reinstate an employee’s loyalty to where they work.

But, it might not reap as many benefits for your business when i t comes to competing for hourly employees. With ride-sharing services—like Uber—offering jobs with flexible hours and a convenient way to make a few bucks while using their personal car, competition for the hourly workforce is heating. So, how do you stand out? We’ve got you covered. Here are four ways you can compete effectively against Uber for hourly employees: 1. Provide minimum wage Workers in the gig economy are often looking for one thing: money. Because of the pandemic, there's a shortage of drivers in the ride-sharing market. And while this has made it easier for drivers to earn more by the hour, Uber’s Vice President of U.S. & Canada Mobility, Dennis Cinelli, warned that this will not last. As the pandemic settles and more drivers return, it will become more difficult for them to maximize their earnings. In Seattle, a city-commissioned study found that drivers only made $9.70/hour after all necessary deductions even though ride-hail drivers there have a minimum wage of $16.39/hour. Meanwhile, a proposed new law in Massachusetts might result in these drivers earning less than 40% of the city’s minimum wage after accounting for unpaid idle time, extra benefits costs and refunded mileage. What does that mean for businesses hiring hourly employees? Well, for one, it means that you have a better opportunity of attracting hourly employees and luring them away from driving services such as Lyft and Uber. Make it a point to provide at least minimum wage and emphasize that they won’t need to use their own vehicles to earn money, nor will they have to face unpaid time during idle hours. 2. Give them time When it comes to driving for Uber, there’s always that uncertainty of not picking up enough passengers. But you might be wondering–since there are fewer drivers in the market now, there should be sufficient customers to go around, right? Well, not exactly. Due to the lack of Uber drivers, customers are experiencing an increase in fares of up to 79% and longer wait times . Naturally, this will steer customers away from Uber's services because it chips away at the convenience factor. As a result, Uber drivers may not maximize their earnings during their working hours. On the other hand, if the fares return to pre-pandemic levels as more drivers come back to the market, competition for passengers will increase. Ultimately, an Uber driver’s pay is almost uncertain ; there are too many variables at hand. You can compete with them for employees by guaranteeing a set amount of hours for your employees. If you have a full-time job opening, advertise the full 40 hours. And, if it’s possible for the hourly employee to work overtime, make that clear. Spell it out in dollars! Hourly employees are typically working toward something—school tuition, rent, a new car, etc. Advertise the possibilities of income and let them know that they can have a structured schedule so they can anticipate how much they’ll be earning per paycheck. 3. Provide benefits Because Uber drivers are categorized as independent contractors , they aren’t eligible for many employment benefits, including sick pay, vacation and holiday pay, and even minimum wage. If your company offers additional perks and benefits, showcase it. There are many benefits you can offer to entice hourly employees to join your team. If your company offers vacation time or holiday or sick pay, let your candidates know. Millennials, particularly, value their time off to relax, recreate and entertain. And, in times of a pandemic, providing assurance in the form of medical benefits will attract more hourly workers to your company too. 4. Offer tips and bonuses In the midst of the driver shortage, Uber is reportedly spending $250 million on bonuses to lure drivers back to the market. Uber drivers are earning more now than they would before the pandemic—and they were earning tips back then too. Now, we know it might not be feasible or sustainable to give out hefty bonuses all the time, but there are other things you can do to compete on this front. One of the things you can do as an employer is to highlight your tips program, especially if your business allows your employees to receive tips. You can also offer a bonus for loyal employees. For example, you may want to offer a $500 gift card or $300 bonus for employees who stay longer than 90 days. Get creative and remember that you’re competing with a ride-hailing service with deep pockets that wants to hire the same candidates you’re striving to hire. Make your move Uber has undoubtedly grown into a giant since their inception in 2012. They’re likely one of your biggest competitors when it comes to hiring hourly employees—and for good reason. So, with that said, it’s on you to make sure hourly job seekers can clearly see why working for you meets more of their needs, and the four tips outlined above can guide you in positioning your role to be filled quickly.

Desmond shared his interpretation of the latest HR data, regarding recruiting trends and the shift to contactless hiring. Workstream segment runs from 04:15 to 07:04. Emily: Hey Abigail thanks so much. We're gonna speak with Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield in just a moment, but I do want to quickly hit on jobs and another company that's working to accelerate hiring for millions of unemployed folks across the country. Workstream is a hiring platform that works with over 5,000 managers to streamline the hiring process, companies like Chick-fil-A, Uber, Doordash and more. Joining me now on the phone is the co-founder and CEO of Workstream, Desmond Lim . So Desmond, what is the data telling you in terms of what the big employers are seeing? Who's hiring? Who's laying off ? Where are things accelerating and slowing down? Desmond: Thank you so much, Emily. I surely see a trend over the past few days and weeks. There have been many restaurants, QSR trying to actually open up and you know, trying to actually hire fast. We see the trend in this, you know, healthcare, supermarkets, they have been strong for the past few weeks and months, and we see those actually carry on to grow. So I think as you can see from these news and trends, we do see that more and more businesses, companies, they are trying to open up in the past few days and weeks, and we think that trend will actually carry on to grow. Emily: What about though potentially a second wave of infections? What about what's going on with these protests which has, you know, left many businesses closed as they try to protect themselves? I mean, what about potential hiccups along the way to reopening? Desmond: Yeah, that’s a really good thing to ask. Over the past few weeks, we have seen many of our current clients use our software to do this contactless hiring and actually screening, so we see more and more people trying to actually leverage video texting , trying to use tools that can actually help them to screen and actually hire people in a way that is safe and fast. We see more and more, you know, we see a trend of more and more businesses trying to set up a process workflow that can help to keep people safe, so we think that trend would actually carry on. People know that there could be this second wave or maybe even worse, third wave, but people know that they always have to keep things going so they are trying to change the way that they work, trying to change the way that they screen, hire people and source , and by trying to do that they are trying to use more video texting, trying to set up workflows that can keep dancing. Emily: Alright Desmond Lim, the CEO of Workstream, thank you so much for joining us obviously. We're going to continue to watch these jobs numbers and the trends within.

There are roughly 4.8 million employees working in almost 40,000 establishments in the US alone - presenting stiff competition during the hiring process. We were thrilled to hear from Pleasant Hill Grocery Outlet (managed by Jason Olson and Kathy Olson ) as they shared about how they use Workstream to increase their total applicant pool by 81% while getting higher quality candidates. Most interestingly, sifting through all these retail and grocery store applicants didn't add any additional time. The Olsons use Workstream to automate the screening and scheduling process, so they can fill roles in a fraction of the time. Watch and learn how they did it! Grocery Outlet was founded in the late 40s. We’ve grown to just over 300 stores now across six different states. Each store is owned and independently operated. It’s a great business and we love it. We love providing jobs to 30 employees in our community that are here with us. They’ve become part of our family. Something that we struggle with, which probably a lot of smaller companies as well as large ones do, is hiring – the hiring process . Just trying to attract people, qualified people, and vetting the people. One of the beauties about Workstream is that they simplified that for us. Everything is computer-based, and we can simply work with Workstream to come up with a variety of questions to ask the applicants. Previously, we’ve hired mainly using social media platforms , Facebook, things like that. Walk-ins off the street that we offer an application to. And since using Workstream, we have hired seven really good quality candidates. So not only can you vet your employees, have emails and resumes coming to you, you can respond through text message and email without even giving your personal cell phone number out. It’s all through the system. Workstream has been a great benefit to us. It’s helped in hiring people, saving us lots of time and money, having less turnover, having more quality candidates, and it saves us from hunting down the street for employees that may or may not have lasted for us. So we’re very happy with it. Quite honestly, my wife and I want to say a shoutout to Workstream , a big ‘thank you’. Because it really has helped us through our entire application and hiring process. Its ease and speed, which is all about our retail experience. We couldn’t be happier with the programme. It’s saved us a ton of time, and you know, time is money in this business. As much as we love what we do, if we can expedite certain tasks, we’re more than happy to do it. And Workstream ’s been a wonderful partner in helping us achieve that.

For the past 10 months with Workstream , Tin Pot Creamery obtained 21 applicants with just a week of posting. They've seen a significant increase in applicants and have gained more oversight of their hiring process. Tin Pot Creamery started in 2012 and since that time, we have been using our homemade recipes to make our very delicious flavour robust ice-cream and baked treats. So the hiring challenges that we faced before adopting Workstream were vast. I think that as most people know, I think that if they are in service and restaurant industry, the labour market has been very tough over the last five years or so. And finding good talent is challenging. Before, our process was really hard to oversee, all of the managers are responsible for their individual locations. They would get paper applications. It was very hard to see if we’re getting the right paperwork, if we’re getting the right quality applicants. We didn’t have all the information in one place. And so with Workstream, now we have the ability to see where our candidate is in our hiring process. We have all of the documentation in one place so it’s very easy for us to review candidates and discuss them with our hiring team. The first feature that I love about Workstream is that we can customize the stages of our on-boarding process . We’re able to ask for T-shirt sizes, their shoe sizes - not the ordinary kinds of application questions. Workstream has helped us in really being able to have much greater outreach to potential candidates. For me, Workstream has made my job a lot easier. I don’t have to go to the store and get paperwork all day. I can easily go on my computer and see how many applicants we have. I can make sure they have all the forms like I9 and W2 . We are able to accelerate the hiring process , which has really been key to our business as we can focus elsewhere. I can also see where we are getting a majority of our applicants. If there is a channel that works a lot better, we will focus our efforts on that one. Workstream has meant that Tin Pot Creamery is able to hire the talent that is critical for making our business successful.

If you are not training, then you are neglecting half the job.” - the late Thomas J. Watson, former Chairman and CEO of IBM. Like Watson, many leaders have repeatedly emphasized the importance of a new hire training program and training new employees, along with the value it brings to a company. In fact, not training new employees could bring more harm to the organization than good, even when it comes to hourly workers. Research has shown that the primary reason for employees leaving a company is the lack of growth, development opportunities, and advancements in their job positions. Needless to say, the high turnover rate that comes after is bound to incur additional costs for the company, and they are not as insignificant as they seem. To put things into perspective, the cost of hiring someone can be as high as 30% of the job’s salary. That is around $12,000 for an employee who makes $40,000 a year! With that in mind, we know how important it is to include a new hire training program in the process of onboarding hourly workers in order to retain them. Thus, we have gathered some tips for training new employees in this article. Read on to find out how to build an effective new employee training program! What Is a New Hire Trainer? New hire training is an integral part of the onboarding process, designed to get newcomers up to speed and accustomed to their new role and job duties. The ultimate goal? To improve retention rates, create a harmonious team atmosphere, and facilitate productivity. Typically, a new hire training program is meticulously crafted by human resources, in collaboration with relevant department heads, to meet specific training needs. During this time, new hires can expect to experience a mix of training sessions. We're talking one-on-one conversations, online courses—like those you might find on LinkedIn—and even quizzes to evaluate the trainees' understanding and check in on their progress. This training plan can come in various formats and training methods—online training, shadowing more experienced team members, or even role-specific training like using particular software. It's vital for team leaders and HR to check in with new hires regularly, especially during their first week, to ensure that they understand the company culture and are aligning with it. Training materials should be updated and could include a variety of resources from FAQs to video tutorials. Bear in mind that the new hire training program should be tailored to the learners, especially when there's a diverse range of job descriptions in your big, mid, or small business. At the end of the day, the effectiveness of your new employee training program can make or break the transition into the new job. So, make it count. The Importance of Training New Employees Did you know that rehiring costs can make up approximately 12% of a company’s expenses, with it going up to 40% for those with a high turnover rate? It’s true. But simply providing training for your new and current employees can mitigate these costs. Furthermore, it takes up far less time as compared to recruiting new hires for the job. However, these exorbitant costs that come from rehiring are not the only reason that makes the training of new employees important. Investing in employee training also leads to better returns for the company as employees can work smarter and more efficiently. In turn, they can complete more tasks at a given time. And considering that you are paying them by the hour, it will undoubtedly give you the most bang for your buck! Companies that invest $1,500 on training per employee saw an average of 24% more profit than companies that did not. As Richard Branson said, “Take care of your employees, and they will take care of your business”. By constantly working on employee engagement through the provision of training, your employees will naturally become loyal to your brand. As the needs of your employees are satisfied, they will increasingly find value in working in your company and striving towards your organization’s goals. In turn, you will notice higher customer satisfaction and production standards as a result of your training efforts. Remote New Hire Training The coronavirus pandemic brought about a new normal in 2020, from social distancing measures to the digitization of, well, everything. Inevitably, the usual onboarding process was altered to meet the new societal standards. Employee training, in particular, was no longer allowed to be organized in huge batches, and companies are encouraged to move them online as much as possible. This is where remote employee training played a crucial role when training new hires. While remote training was essential in the 2020 pandemic climate, there’s no denying the challenges that come with its usage. For one, it is probably not the most conducive way to communicate due to technical challenges or even distractions from remote environments. Moreover, the lack of personal interaction may pose a problem as new hires might find it difficult to clarify their questions online. Thus, finding the most optimal way to conduct your training is imperative to make sure that it meets the objectives of your company. To ensure a smooth onboarding experience for your new employees, consider harnessing digital tools that can relay information in the least troublesome way. As hourly workers mostly only require general knowledge about the company as well as details about their job scope, a platform that facilitates virtual learning dynamically will be best to engage the attention of the new hires. Additionally, check that communication platforms are well established between the managers and the new employees so that they can clarify their doubts easily. At Workstream, we kickstart your mobile training by automating text messages to your new employees once they are hired. This message contains essential items such as your onboarding handbook , checklists, and employee training videos and it allows them to be equipped with the basic knowledge of their position before their first day of work. Not only will it help them smoothly transition into their role, but they will also be able to access these resources anytime and anywhere. The popular fast-food franchise, McDonald’s, has adopted this approach and it’s proven to make their hiring process so much more efficient. We help you manage the dissemination of information vital to your onboarding so that you can focus on the other aspects of your hiring process. To see how we can best meet your needs, schedule a time with our hiring experts today! Tips for Training New Employees Establishing a new hire training program may sound like an arduous task. But doing it right can bring your company a long way. To ensure that your training is effective, consider following the tips below when developing your training program. Communicate with your newly hired employees before their first day of work Just like how Workstream makes onboarding easier for our clients’ new employees, communicating with your new hires before their first day of work is essential to ensure that they are prepared to fulfill their job tasks and responsibilities. And this applies to both remote and physical training. Some of the information that could be imparted may include a brief description of their job responsibilities, employee handbook, and training videos, as well as the expectations they have to meet as an employee of their company. By doing this, you can manage the expectations of the employee before they start their work properly. Moreover, it helps in making them feel more prepared, while at the same time keeping the staff involved in their training more organized and efficient. Peer training Most often than not, current employees can give a more comprehensive overview of the tasks at hand since they have firsthand experience in the position. As such, consider incorporating peer training into your onboarding process - it might just help your new hire work more efficiently after learning the tips and tricks from your current employee. If you are in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) industry, for example, you may want to let your new employee shadow your best servers to observe how they go about their responsibilities. Hands-on training As hourly positions usually involve a lot of physical duties, providing training that is engaging and on-the-job, such as hands-on training, will be an effective way to train your new hires. By observing how a certain task is done and emulating them after, they are better able to get used to their job at hand. This especially applies to positions that require the usage of new technology. Apply the 10-min rule When going through vital information with your new employees, it is important to keep them engaged to ensure that you have their attention, especially when it is in a remote setting. Grosskopf, the author of the book “Awake Leadership”, advises hiring managers to break up these informative sessions and ask questions after every 10 minutes or so. Additionally, you may want to gather input from your trainees on the pace of your training to make sure that they can keep up with your content. Onboarding your new employees right is just as important as training them.

New Hire Training Checklist by Industry We know training new employees can get tedious and messy sometimes. And we understand your frustrations!

Read the full post below to find out how they are rising to the challenge and adapting different strategies to overcome these problems. It’s no understatement to say that senior living communities are being ravaged by coronavirus. In New York, residents at 354 nursing homes have tested positive for COVID-19. In California, a nursing home was forced to evacuate residents because the majority of staff failed to show up to work for multiple days. Many senior living facilities fear for the health of their residents and staff. Others are in preparation mode—they’re ramping up hiring, streamlining processes, and adding training in line with recommendations from the CDC . The fact of the matter is that senior living facilities are in crunch mode to find and vet qualified workers to help provide quality care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the methods that were used for hiring in a pre-coronavirus world simply won’t cut it. This pandemic has forever changed how we hire qualified workers in the senior living space. There are three emerging trends driving new practices that all hiring managers in the space should adopt. During this time these new tactics will shape how the industry hires for years to come. 1. Video Interviews Zoom isn’t just for meetings—it’s an easy way to conduct interviews while reducing the spread of coronavirus. Usually when people apply for a job at a senior living facility, they’re texted a link to schedule their in-person interviews. To help prevent any risk of spreading COVID-19, hiring managers are now adding a video intro stage and/or are switching to video conferences. This method has been proven to not only adhere to social distancing guidelines, but hiring managers are finding that it helps to expedite the interview process. In order to automate hiring qualified workers, management should lean into video interviews . A few ways they can do this include: Recording Intros: Some ask applicants to record a 30-second video introducing themselves. Hiring managers then screen the videos and decide who to invite for follow up video or in-person interviews. This is especially prevalent when hiring care drivers. Video Conferences: Others are completely doing away with the in-person interview. The applicant still receives a link to schedule an interview, but their confirmation message is a link to a Zoom Conference rather than a physical address. Multiple hiring managers can join the same interview, rather than stacking interviews back-to-back. Efficiency is everything. Including video intro submissions and/or adding video conferences enables management to fast track the interview and hiring process. It allows for hiring managers to vet cultural fits without having to meet in person. 2. Flexible Schedules & Benefits There’s a war for talent going on in the senior living space. To get ahead, many facilities are offering shorter, more flexible shifts. Doing a close analysis of job descriptions, there is a rise in the number of job postings mentioning “flexible hours” directly in the headline. Many business owners have found that posts that clearly communicate scheduling flexibility within the job description receive up to twice as many applicants. Not only are applicants seeking a work schedule that adheres to their lifestyle, but they are closely looking at what benefits are being offered by the company. And many senior living facilities are pivoting their benefits to attract top talent and including this in their job postings. For example, Aegis Living is offering a 401K, educational assistance, and $1 meals for all employees and family members. Additionally, they’ve added nontraditional benefits, like company-wide lotteries for cash rewards and vacations to attract more qualified workers. Another trend the industry is seeing in the benefits space is offering childcare. In fact, companies like Dominion Senior Living are providing workers a monthly stipend of $500 to cover childcare in pandemic-stricken states. In order to win over top talent, hiring managers need to assess if they are able to offer flexibility in their employees’ work schedules, as well as see where they can provide rich benefits to attract more qualified job applicants. By including this information in a job posting or job description, senior hiring executives and managers will increase their pool of qualified applicants. 3. Mobile Training Reducing the spread of coronavirus requires implementing new procedures fast. Senior living facilities are increasingly using various communications platforms to share guidelines linking to CDC resources on protective gear, limiting visitors, and cohorting ill residents. Another increasing trend is having training videos sent via text message links that not only keep employees safe, but also improve efficiency around training. Some link to webinars, such as this presentation by Dr. Kara Jacobs Slifka describing actions that should be taken by residents and staff to slow the spread of COVID-19. More recently there are a lot of fast, simple iPhone videos where an administrator is speaking directly to the screen. On top of virtual training tactics, this is helping teams stay connected and maintain morale during this unprecedented time. The COVID-19 situation is evolving quickly, and senior living facilities are often the epicenters of local outbreaks. I have enormous respect for frontline workers and this is an important moment for all of us to work together.

While highlighting the job responsibilities and requirements is important, it’s equally essential to call out the benefits of the position. Pay may seem like the most important factor in job descriptions, but the benefits are the icing on the cake. Emphasizing the perks and advantages of working for your company can significantly increase the job's appeal and attract high-quality applicants. What benefits should you call out, and how do you properly communicate that? Here are four tips on effectively calling out benefits in your job descriptions. Prioritize key benefits Supplemental pay Pay is one of the most important factors applicants consider when choosing a job opportunity. So if you have benefits that can add to their paycheck or save money, highlight them boldly in your job description. These benefits could include free meals during their shift (essentially a $10-$15 bonus), friends and family discounts, or even bonuses and tip shares. These perks will be key in motivating an applicant to consider the job, especially if your organization cannot offer the most competitive wage rate . Flexibility Remember that everyone has lives outside of work, and an employer who can offer flexibility can be more appealing than one who doesn’t. Flexible hours attract applicants and improve retention, effectively reducing turnover rates. Make your flexible policies stand out in your job description. If you have an on-call calendar for rescheduling during emergencies or are willing to customize schedules according to your employees’ needs, be sure to mention that. Work-life balance has also become increasingly important for job seekers. According to a survey by FlexJobs, 82% of respondents identified work-life balance as the most crucial factor when considering a new job . Emphasize flexible work arrangements or paid time off policies that promote a healthy work-life balance. Employee well-being initiatives Companies that prioritize employee well-being often see improved productivity and engagement. According to a survey by SHRM, 61% of employees consider their organization’s wellness offerings when deciding whether to stay with the company. If your organization offers wellness programs, mental health support, or other well-being initiatives, be sure to mention them in the job description. Other attractive benefits Identify and highlight other valuable benefits your company offers prominently in the job description. Applicants are particularly interested in benefits like health insurance, flexible work arrangements, professional development opportunities, and positive work culture. Ensure these benefits are clearly mentioned early in the description to capture applicants’ attention. Call out growth opportunities In today’s highly competitive job market, applicants value opportunities for growth and advancement. Additionally, among employees considering leaving their jobs, 41% choose to do so due to a lack of advancement opportunities , compared to 30% who mentioned pay. This means that career advancement opportunities are deemed more important to employees and should be included in the job description. Highlight the various career growth opportunities your organization offers, such as training programs, mentorship initiatives, or potential career paths available within your organization. For example, a new employee can become a shift lead within the first six months. It shows that you’re looking to fill the position for a long time and reinforces that you’re willing to reward your employees for doing so. It also demonstrates that you’re invested in the professional development of your employees, which can help attract ambitious applicants seeking long-term growth. Use specific language Phrases like “great atmosphere” and “lots of growth potential” are overused and don’t give applicants real information about the work environment. Be specific about the growth potential by stating timelines or examples of growth opportunities. Instead of “competitive salary,” specify the salary range or mention performance-based bonuses or incentives. This helps applicants understand the tangible benefits they can expect from the role. Additionally, it’s OK to include your company history and philosophy but keep it concise. Your employees want to work for a mission-driven company, but it's far less important than working somewhere where they're fairly compensated for their hard work and dedication. Provide a comprehensive benefits summary Toward the end of the job description, provide a concise summary of all the benefits offered by your organization. This could include healthcare plans, retirement savings options, paid time off, employee discounts, and other unique perks. A comprehensive benefits summary ensures that applicants understand the total compensation package clearly, reiterates important points that may stand out to them, and motivates them to apply. The ability to create enticing job descriptions is key to attracting qualified applicants. By incorporating the tips above, you can effectively communicate the advantages of working for your company—beyond pay. Highlighting work-life balance and professional development opportunities will further enhance the job's appeal, while a comprehensive benefits summary nicely wraps everything up.

Not at all. But is it an essential tool for any restaurant owner that wants to thrive and grow their business in 2022? Absolutely! That’s why we want to encourage you to write or update your operations manual by showing you: Why it’s important to have a restaurant operations manual What information to include in the manual Five steps to writing one yourself But, first, let’s start with the most basic question so that we’re all on the same page! What is a restaurant operations manual? A restaurant operations manual is a comprehensive document that consists of the most important information and guidelines for running a restaurant . From restaurant concepts to operational guidelines, the manual explains the processes and procedures you and your staff follow to keep your restaurant running smoothly. Why is it important to have a restaurant operations manual? When written correctly, your operations manual can benefit your restaurant in a variety of ways. Here are five of the top reasons you’ll want to either write or update your operations manual for the new year. Support the onboarding process There are a lot of things to learn whenever you start a new job. A detailed restaurant manual can become a reference guide for your new hires, no matter their role. In turn, this helps to speed up the onboarding process and reduce time and resources spent on training. Increase efficiency A detailed manual also helps your employees make decisions efficiently, without needing to always ask their superiors for reassurance. With set procedures written in detail, your employees will know the proper actions to take whenever common problems arise. Improve the customer experience Great customer service is key to converting casual customers into loyal customers. When you attain consistency and efficiency through process standardization, you make the process of satisfying your customers much easier. Accelerate business growth With everything well-explained in the manual, employees will have more resources to focus on achieving goals and expanding how you serve your customers. You could even use the manual to make the process of opening additional locations much smoother. Provide guidelines for unexpected situations Your manual can’t predict the future. But it can provide reference on what steps employees should take when unexpected situations occur due to things like weather emergencies, changes to health guidelines or difficult customers. How to write a restaurant manual for 2022 Let’s start by looking at what specific information your restaurant operations manual should include. What’s included in an operations manual? Company introduction This first section introduces your employees to the background, history and goals of your restaurant . For example, you might include information like: When the restaurant first opened Your target customers Long-term goals Your core values and mission statement General opening and closing schedules Organizational structure It’s important your employees know the organizational structure of your restaurant. This helps to ensure everyone knows who to turn to for immediate questions related to daily tasks. The most effective way to present the organizational structure is by using a top-down flowchart in hierarchy form. You can also categorize the structure by job functions (e.g. kitchen staff) so it’s easier for employees to identify their team and reporting manager. Job descriptions, expectations and responsibilities In this section, you’ll list each job title along with its core responsibilities. This helps to set and maintain clear expectations for each of your employees and creates a standard they can easily refer to. This section also allows employees to understand their co-workers’ responsibilities, creating a culture of appreciation among the team. You can also use this section to identify roles needed to expand your business in the future. Contact details Next, include the contact information of people that your employees may need to reach out to for work-related issues. This may include the phone numbers and email addresses for restaurant managers, human resources and you. You may also want to include contact information for external services your restaurant uses for things like gas, electricity, water, internet, etc. This will make it easier for your employees to respond to any problems with those services. Standard operating procedures Standard operating procedures (SOP) are the backbone of your restaurant operations manual. Why? Because an SOP provides step-by-step instructions for every important task of your restaurant. They also set the standard for how employees should perform certain tasks and can become reference guides for new hires in training. Some important tasks that you should write SOPs for in your operations manual include: Food regulations. Include procedures on things like food preparation, ingredient storing, kitchen sanitation, etc. Opening and closing. Create a checklist for what needs to be done when opening and closing your restaurant. Customer service. Include everything from how to greet customers, how to take orders, how to handle customer complaints, etc. Technology and machines. Provide instructions on how to efficiently use all technology and machines in your restaurant. Emergencies. Outline the steps your employees should take when there is an emergency, such as a fire, so they know how to handle the situation and minimize the impact. 5 steps to write your operations manual It might be tempting to skip writing your restaurant operations manual. But please don’t! The long-term benefits will make it well worth your time. Plus, you don’t have to do everything in one go! Tackle each of the following steps individually and move on to the next whenever you’re ready. Step 1 - Brainstorm and organize the information What will you need to include in each section of your operations manual? Do you already have that information stored somewhere else? You’ll likely spend the most time thinking of what SOPs you need to create. Start by thinking of the most important daily tasks for you and your employees. You may also want to ask employees to write down the steps they take to complete the task. This will help you understand the task from an employee’s point of view. In this step, you may also find it helpful to create a table of contents. That way you can maintain organization throughout the entire process of developing the manual. Step 2 - Draft your content Now, it’s time to begin writing the content of your manual! This step will seem tedious. But remember that it will save you time in the future when it’s time to train new employees. When writing your SOPs, try to avoid generic and broad statements such as “greet the customer” that can be interpreted in different ways. Instead, include detailed instructions and examples for how to perform each task efficiently. Step 3 - Review and revise the content Once you have the draft written, share the content with your team to get their feedback. Ask for suggestions that can make your content more user-friendly and check if you have missed any important procedures. Then, spend time revising it until you have everything compiled neatly into one document that’s ready to share. Step 4 - Choose how to save and share your manual Your first instinct might be to print out your operations manual in booklets and then distribute it among your staff. But is this method ideal? Not really! It’s costly, wastes paper and makes your manual difficult to update. We suggest you save and share a digital copy of your manual with your staff. If you still want a physical copy, you can print one to leave in the restaurant for immediate reference purposes. Step 5 - Plan to periodically update the manual Lastly, update the manual from time to time as your business expands. You may also need to update it as the rules and regulations change for how restaurants operate during the pandemic . After making updates, be sure to highlight new content so your employees don’t have to reread everything whenever a new version of the handbook is released. Final thoughts By creating a restaurant operations manual, you ensure that your restaurant can deliver a high standard of service for years to come. It can definitely be time-consuming to create one from scratch. But it’s well worth the investment! As we shared earlier, an operations manual that includes detailed information and procedures can help: Support the onboarding process Increase efficiency Improve the customer experience Accelerate business growth Provide guidelines for unexpected situations All of those things are essential to thriving in 2022! So, make time to create your manual as soon as you can to prepare for the new year.

The team culture. When your employees are committed to nurturing and upholding the team’s shared values, beliefs, behaviors and workplace processes, there are often fewer conflicts that derail them from working toward their shared goal. Add a supportive team culture to the mix, and you have a team that not only gets their job done, but that also takes the extra steps to help their coworkers succeed. Everyone is willing to roll up their sleeves to help. Having a supportive culture, that's free from the “that’s not my job” attitude, creates an atmosphere that’s inviting and welcoming to both your employees and your guests, and that’s great for business. If you’re looking to be more intentional about creating a more supportive team culture, start with these four steps. 1. Hire great people A supportive team culture starts with the people on the team. It goes without saying that having the best people working for you will take you the furthest. Optimistic and hardworking people understand the importance of a supportive team, and they watch for that when they’re looking for work. When you’re hiring new team members, it’s best to avoid naysayers or people who only worry about themselves. To build a supportive culture, keep an eye out for these qualities when you’re interviewing candidates: Great communicator Team-oriented Collaborator Reliable Full of integrity 2. Make your goals and expectations clear Every team—in and outside of the restaurant industry—needs a strong leader that can unite them, coach them and point them to their ultimate goal. This is especially true of your staff. If your common goal is the greatest customer service, let your teams know. Clearly communicating what you expect of each of them, individually and collectively, is the only true way to create a functional team that works together. One great way to accomplish common goals is to write them down and post them where everyone can see them. If you have a break room, post it near the table where people sit. Or, put it above the time clock so your employees see it right before they start their shift or return from break. Another way to get the team aligned: make sure that each team member knows your processes and procedures. If there’s a standard way to prep food or clean out the frier, be sure that everyone on the team knows it. Getting everyone on the same page removes arguments for how something should be done, and empowers the team to quickly jump in and help others as needed. 3. Keep building on the team culture Healthy organizational cultures are always changing and growing, so it’s important that you continue to create an environment where your culture can evolve for the better. One way to do this is to work with the unique skills of the individuals on your team. Allow them to bring their whole selves to work. Everyone has strong skills, and leaning into them allows you to build the strongest team possible. For example, if one person prefers to work face-to-face with customers, then allow them to take orders. And, on the flip side of that, if someone is quicker in the back and prefers not to interact with the public, take note. Placing them up front will disrupt the team (and your customer experience). Another way to enrich your team culture is to be intentional about how you approach diversity and inclusion efforts. Diversity among your team members is important, and you should strive, as does Papa John’s, to actively include as many workers from different backgrounds as you can find in your area. When you bring in diversity, you widen your organizational perspective, which empowers you to innovate and solve problems faster. 4. Lead by example Remember: your staff is watching you. If you’re not assisting when there’s a lunch rush or when a shift is down a team member, no matter how much you talk about being a supportive team, the message you’re sending to your team is that you don’t really care. So, as a manager or business owner, take that customer’s order when no one else can, flip the burgers if your cook is on break and mop the dish room floor when it looks like everyone will be getting out late. And as you step up to help, make it fun. Let the team see that you enjoy being with them. Nothing will create a more positive and supportive team culture than when management and team members genuinely have a good time while they work. What are the benefits of a supportive team culture? The rewards for creating a supportive and positive team culture that strives for a common purpose can be profound. Customer service—and customer satisfaction—is at its best when team members work together in a complementary way. And, an extra bonus for you, employee turnover decreases when employees feel connected to their fellow coworkers and management team.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 12/28/21 How competitive wages grow your bottom line Share this article Philosophically, you may not have any concerns about paying your employees a higher wage. After all—especially in today’s tight labor market—it’s a great way to attract and retain employees. But, in practice, you may have reservations. It’s easy to see how you would. Increasing pay can initially be substantial and appear to take a lot off your bottom line. Paying your employees a fair wage, however, is investing in your bottom line. It’s a long game that, if played well, benefits you, your employees and your customers. You may be wondering… What’s a fair wage for a restaurant employee? To determine a fair wage, it’s first important to know the law that governs your state. Be sure to look it up, because it can be different from the federal minimum wage. Once you know the minimum wage in your state, your next task will be to determine the minimum and maximum wages that you’re willing to pay. Start by making a list of the various roles at your restaurant. Then, research the average pay for these roles. You can easily go online and find tools such as PayScale where you can key in the role you want to research and see the range of the pay. Other resources that will give you a bigger breakdown of areas are Glassdoor.com and Salary.com . With these resources, you can see what companies are paying and begin making the decision of whether you want to pay what everyone else is paying, or if you want to pave the way and offer your employees a wage that workers really want. You’ll benefit from your choice to take the high road. 5 benefits of paying your employees a fair wage There is no doubt that restaurants paying a fair or even higher rate see huge returns on their investment. When you place value in employees first—and back it with your actions, your employees will usually respond in kind. You’ll see the benefits across different areas of the business: Employer brand: When you become an employer who pays competitive wages, your reputation will increase. When you have a positive employer brand, more people will want to work for you, which means you have a greater pick of top talent to fill open roles or increase your staff during seasonal rushes. C ompany culture: Think about what goes through the heads of employees who are not paid well. After looking at their paystubs, they might say, “Why bother?” or “Why should I care?” But when your employees feel valued because they’re making reasonable pay, it’s reflected in their work. They will work harder and be more engaged. Interestingly enough, higher salaries have a way of weeding out bad apples and bad attitudes. Turnover: The cost of replacing employees who quit is steep. It’s the time and energy it took to hire that employee, the time and energy it takes to find and hire a new employee, plus the burden it places on the current crew while you seek out new staff members. Consider the savings you would have, even with higher wages, from keeping current employees who are skilled, trained and knowledgeable about the job. Customer service: Higher pay has an amazing effect on your employees. When they feel valued, they are happier. And when they are in better spirits, they will smile more at your guests, go out of their way to get orders right or take a moment to make sure your patrons are doing well. This all adds up to a great customer experience. Profits: If your employees are happy and giving the best customer care they can, your profits will grow with return business. But profits also grow when other costs decrease, such as mistakes in orders that need corrected or fewer fines over staying clean and up to code. How McDonald’s and other fast-food restaurants increased profits when they paid a fair salary Even before the pandemic made it clear to many industries that employees should be paid a fair wage, some restaurants—like McDonald’s, Sonic and Starbucks—were already offering a higher starting wage than their competitors to attract quality employees. Even back in 2015, McDonald’s made it a point to pay their employees $1 more than their competitors were paying. Because of this, McDonald’s sales have always been above average—and they saw a lower turnover. In-N-Out Burger also paid their employees a higher wage and was rated as a top place to work. Even now, these restaurants and many more, like Chipotle and Papa John’s, are paving the way by offering a higher pay rate for their employees. They understand the importance of valuing their employees in today’s tight labor market. Final thoughts When considering if you should bite the bullet and offer a fair and competitive salary, understand that the reward outweighs any initial pain you might experience approving the larger paychecks. In today’s tight job market, it’s important to treat those who are running your business with respect and appreciation. And the best way to accomplish this is by offering a wage that signals just how much you value your team.

The goal of these programs is to help restaurants and other small businesses keep going and ultimately help them recover from financial losses incurred as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. While several states have started these programs only fairly recently, the details of each program vary state by state, including the level of information disclosure required to qualify and the application deadlines. In this article, we take a closer look at North Carolina’s relief grant program as it is the largest of any state for the hospitality industry. What Exactly is the Hospitality Relief Grant Program? The North Carolina Business Recovery Grant Program is targeted at business owners in the hospitality industry who have experienced at least a 20% decline in revenue year-over-year during the pandemic. Business owners who meet these criteria are eligible to receive grants equal to 10% of their losses up to a maximum of $500,000 per business. These grants are untethered, which means business owners can use them for any business expenses they desire. The size of North Carolina’s relief grant program is $500 million. Although the North Carolina Department of Revenue started the grant application process only in the last few days, the funding was included in the state budget enacted in November. Why Did States Start These Hospitality Relief Grant Programs? The National Restaurant Association reports that 17% of restaurants across the U.S.—around 110,000—have shut down during the pandemic. For the restaurants that have managed to remain open, many have had to rely on outdoor dining to survive, especially as the number of coronavirus infections is once again surging. One restaurant, Winston's, spent $100,000 on ceiling heaters and had to cover openings to the outside with plastic tarps to make outdoor dining permanent at their Raleigh, NC restaurant. And Winston’s is not alone. For many restaurants that hope to survive, especially with new virus variants appearing, more financial resources will be needed in order for them to make outdoor dining a permanent option. According to Lynn Minges , President of the North Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association, “North Carolina’s restaurants, hotels, and bars saw over $5 billion in losses due to no fault of their own. These grants will be transformative to businesses across the state who have been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic.” Indeed, one of these transformations for many businesses will be the addition of permanent outdoor dining. The total financial devastation brought upon the hospitality industry by the pandemic has yet to be fully measured. While many restaurants have sadly already gone out of business, states are now taking further steps to provide much-needed assistance to the remaining hospitality business owners, including quick service restaurant (QSR) owners. How Do I Apply for a Hospitality Relief Grant? The application period for the North Carolina hospitality relief program opens on December 16, 2021 and closes on January 31, 2022. The grant amounts for each business will be finalized at the end of the application period (January 31, 2022). All grant payments are made by check and mailed to the address of the applicant business after the grant amounts have been finalized. Checks are expected to be mailed to approved businesses by the end of February or early March 2022. Online application is encouraged. Business owners can complete a short application from their personal computer or by completing the online application at one of the Department of Revenue’s service centers . Planning Ahead for How Best to Use Your Hospitality Relief Grant After you submit your application for your state’s hospitality relief grant program, it's time to start planning in earnest how to make the best use of the grant for your QSR. As we mentioned earlier, one of the best aspects of these hospitality relief grants is that they are untethered, which means they can be used for any business expense that you have. This untethered freedom means you have a blank page to decide what would be best for your QSR. One option to consider is your staffing requirements. Many QSRs have a hard time hiring enough top talent for their restaurants. One of the best ways to future-proof the success of your QSR is to implement next-generation hiring technologies to ensure your restaurant is properly staffed, no matter the current climate of the job market. Here at Workstream, we offer cutting-edge hiring technologies that allow you to scale your hiring processes so that you can source the highest volume of high-quality talent possible for your restaurant.

But don’t get too comfortable! These revisions will affect restaurants and service establishments everywhere that have tipped employees on staff. So, if your restaurant falls into this category, keep reading. There are several important changes to the DOL 80/20 tip rule that you will need to understand. But first… What is the DOL 80/20 Tip Rule? The 80/20 tip rule is a rule from the Department of Labor that requires employers with tipped employees to pay minimum wage instead of the lower tip credit wage for any time their workers spend 1) performing duties that are not tip-generating or tasks that are unrelated to their tip-generating duties and 2) that surpass 20% of their overall time for the week or that are done continually for more than 30 minutes. Brief History of the DOL 80/20 Tip Rule The 80/20 tip rule is not a new rule. It was first introduced into the DOL Field Operations Handbook (FOH) back in 1988, and was developed out of policies established in the 1979, 1980, and 1985 Opinion Letters in regard to when employers could take tip credit. In 2018, the rule was rescinded to issue new sub-regulatory guidance allowing employers to take the tip credit when their employees performed non-tipped duties. Later, the DOL published the 2020 tip final rule. They then extended the effective date to April 30, and later to December so that the DOL could have time to reconsider the 80/20 ruling. On December 28, the revisions to the Fair Labor Standard Act (FLSA) will come into effect. The purpose of the final rule is to provide clarity and flexibility to employers for the variable situations that can come up for tipped occupations. It also aims to protect tipped workers who are essential to business and often easily subject to abuse by employers who (consciously or unconsciously) may take advantage of their low wage. (For example, sending the dishwasher home early and having the tipped employee finish the cleanup.) Currently, seven states do not permit employers to claim this tax credit. What to Know about the DOL 80/20 Tip Rule To better understand the DOL 80/20 tip rule, it’s important to understand that the FLSA requires employers to pay a minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Employers can satisfy a portion of the minimum wage obligation to any employee that falls under the definition of a “tipped employee” and take a partial credit called “tip credit,” so long as the employer meets the requirement of paying the worker at least $2.13. For an employee to be considered a “tipped employee,” they must be engaged in an occupation in which they customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips. Some examples include waiters, bellhops, waitresses, countermen, busboys, service bartenders, barback, and certain sushi chefs. The ruling covers “dual jobs,” where the understanding is that not all of the job functions that are performed by those defined as tip workers are related to tip-earning functions and the employer should not claim the tip credit for any work done by the employee that is not tip-producing work and that is performed for more than 20% of the hours worked by that employee for a workweek or for a continuous time period exceeding 30 minutes. In the past, the actual definition of what duties fall under “dual jobs” was not clearly documented. Multiple circuit courts stated that the Department’s 80/20 guidance was difficult for employers to administer and led to confusion about what was and was not a tip-producing duty. Taking into account commentators' input, the final rule explains that directly supporting work that is performed either in preparation of or in assistance of an employee’s tip-producing work for customers is subject to the tip credit. Examples include making coffee for the table they are serving, setting the table in their section they are serving, cutting and placing a piece of cake on a plate for another table they are serving, all of which falls under the rule and for which the employer can take the tip credit, not needing to count any of this toward the 20%. However, if the employee fills the salt and pepper shakers at the end of the shift or carries and puts away dishes, and these tasks are done for more than 20% of their work time for the week, the employer needs to pay the tipped employee direct cash wages equal to the minimum wage for that time. What Do You Need to Do? The changes to the 80/20 rule could increase your costs. To minimize that impact if and where you can, conduct an audit to better understand who’s performing which duties what and how long each of those responsibilities takes. From there, determine if adjusting job scopes and roles is appropriate—and make the changes that will be best for your business and your employees. Once you’ve established that, you’ll want to introduce and maintain strong timekeeping rigor—for you and your employees. This will help you stay compliant and help you see if and where future adjustments need to be made to reduce the monetary impact on your business. As the employer, you’ll also need to be especially diligent with scheduling and work classification. Not doing so could result in exposing yourself to a higher risk of collective action for unpaid and underpaid wages. And while all of these changes may be driven by the law, there is definitely a silver lining for your bottom line: the processes you’re putting into motion will help you better understand your business and may create efficiencies you didn’t know were possible.

You may not (yet) be in a position to offer year-end bonuses, discounts on trips, and pool tables in the break room. But there are creative and scrappy ways to show candidates the benefits of working for you—and why they would want to be a part of the team. These are the incentives you should talk about. To be effective, though, you need to start by first understanding what the current workforce needs and wants . A pizza party every Friday is nice, but it’s not what really motivates employees. They want perks that really show that the company values and cares about them. If you’re looking for ways to attract and retain employees—even when you can’t compete against other companies on all benefits—look no further. Here’s a list of the most meaningful (and affordable) perks. 1. Create a Fun Work Environment Most people don’t want to go to a job that is boring and dull. Now, you can’t always make each employee’s workload completely interesting, but you can have a fun work environment. Allow people to decorate their workspace if possible. If your physical work environment can’t support a personalized workspace, get the team involved in decorating the entire restaurant for various holidays. And speaking of holidays, don’t be afraid to have fun celebrations. Encourage the team to dress up, organize a few in-house games, and host friendly competitions. This will give your employees more reasons to be excited about coming to work. There are also things you can do outside of work to foster a fun work environment. This could be organizing a softball or bowling team or getting involved with volunteer groups and inviting your staff to join. These types of activities not only promote healthy team-building, but they also show you (a general manager or business owner) are a person who cares about more than just making money. 2. Offer Flexible Schedules and Time Off More and more, people are finding that they want a balance in work and life. The days when a person would arrive at work early and stay until the sun went down, all the while telling their children they will have to miss dinner together, is over. Employees want the flexibility that allows them to meet up with family and friends for special occasions. For some, that might look like being home every night by 6 p.m. for dinner. For others, that might be starting work after school drop off at 9 a.m. every weekday. It costs very little to grant employees this flexibility and it goes a long way in showing your employees you care about their needs and priorities. Another appealing, low-cost perk is special days off. For a days’ pay, you can give your employee their birthday and/or their work anniversary off as a way to thank them for another year of service. 3. Have Recognition Programs You might be surprised to learn how little recognition programs cost and how much of a difference they can make. For as little as the price of paper and a treat, you can implement an employee-to-employee recognition program that encourages fellow employees to say thank you to each other for helping out in a rush, lending a hand with cleaning up a mess, and giving someone a break when they were feeling stressed. Recognition programs can also be implemented cheaply. As a manager, you can say thank you with an “employee of the month” plaque and by granting that employee prime parking, a gift card, or a small bag of goodies. The tokens associated with recognition programs may be small in monetary value, but when the sentiment is rooted in genuine gratitude, the impact on employees is large. Employees want to know they’re making a difference. 4. Give Out Swag Branded t-shirts, hoodies, and hats are affordable (and useful) and promote a sense of team among your employees. Giving your team new swag is not only a fun way to unite them and show appreciation, it’s also a great way to get your employer brand in front of potential future hires. (After all, who doesn’t want to be part of a crew that regularly gets cool, free apparel?) Swag comes in all forms and price points. Mugs, pens, and hand sanitizer also are other inexpensive and practical items that you can give to your employees to signal the same message. 5. Make Things Easy Who doesn’t love a low-stress work environment? An easy and low-cost way to do this is to reduce clutter and implement easy work procedures. See where you can cut unnecessary steps from processes, and be open to new ideas your employees may have on how to simplify tasks. One suggestion from your team could be the one change that drastically improves operations, makes your restaurant more efficient, and ups your reputation as a prime employer who gives everyone a voice. Another way to make work easy is to use new technologies. And, having the best tech is not always as expensive as it might seem. There are a variety of tools and apps designed to make work and communication easier for employees and employers, even starting well before an applicant becomes an employee. When hiring , for example, using technology that allows you to automatically engage with an applicant before another company does is a game-changer—for you and the job seeker who’s eager to get a job. Conclusion So, the next time you have a scheduled interview with that new dishwasher or grill cook, know that you can still be competitive. With a great work environment and simple perks, you can be competitive with the larger corporations and grow your business with a happy and productive staff.

    "text": "The Stream The Stream Blog Templates Podcasts Webinars Guides Categories Payroll Franchise HR Tech Company news People management Recruiting strategies Applicant experience Subscribe Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletter People management 11/12/21 Empathy: The Key to Keep Your Restaurant Running Smoothly Share this article Right now, there is a labor shortage. Finding and hiring quality hourly workers is hard. And the current QSR workforce has the upper hand. Not only are they asking for better wages and better work environments, but they are also asking for schedules that align with their view of a work-life balance. Now, your first reaction might be to say that you have a business to run and that employees can either accept the position offered and work the schedule you give them or that you will just hire someone else. But we all know that isn’t going to work in today’s job market. That attitude and reaction, more likely than not, will cause your employees to call off or quit and you’ll be left to fill the open shifts yourself. One of the most effective ways to lead through this is with empathy. It goes a long way with attracting and retaining employees so your business can run smoothly and predictably. What is Empathy? Similar to sympathy and compassion, empathy differs in the fact that it is someone’s ability to understand where another person is coming from. You can put yourself in their shoes and see things from their point of view. With empathy in the workplace, you have a better perception of what the modern workforce needs and wants. How Business Benefits from Empathy It might seem unlikely, but empathy helps you make educated decisions when it comes to interaction with your team. Improves Recruitment Efforts With competition for top talent as tough as it is, using methods that attract the right workers is important. The recruitment strategies of the past no longer work. So, it’s important to be an employer of choice and have positive employer branding. People talk to each other about their jobs and can look up employer ratings online. If current workers say that your restaurant is a place that cares and is willing to work around schedules, then more people are likely to apply to work for you. Improves Sales When employees feel heard and understood, morale is high and they’re more engaged. Happy employees strive to help the business reach its goals. They’re willing to work harder and stay with the business. They will smile and be more eager to help serve the customer. They will keep workstations cleaner. And they will be more willing to work around the needs of the restaurant. All this will attract more patrons and improve the bottom line. How to be Empathetic in the Workplace It’s one thing to say that you practice empathy in the workplace, but it’s quite another to actually be empathetic. It takes work to learn the skill. The first step is to acknowledge that you want to be more empathetic. The second is to take action. Great general managers and business owners all excel in this skill. Engage with Others It’s not enough to walk into work in the morning and distribute duties. Interact with your employees. Get to know your employees' families and learn the names of their children or spouse. Ask about their hobbies and how they got started in them. Check-in with their ambitions. Also, work alongside them when you can. Nothing says you respect them and understand what their day-to-day is like then experiencing it yourself. When your employees share that a certain task is difficult or a shift needs more people on it, you’ have better context and are better suited to make improvements. Actively Listen Listening is one skill that a lot of people don’t realize is important. When you actively listen, you generally hear what is being said. Many people just listen so they are prepared to react and get their message across. A real listener is able to process the information they receive and take proper action. Pay Attention to Body Language Your body language can say a lot about how you’re feeling. Crossing your arms over your chest or rolling your eyes is a clear indicator that you don’t care, which may lead your employee to feel resentment. Instead, stand relaxed and make eye contact. Identify Unconscious Bias Never assume you know what others feel, need, or motivate their decisions. Especially if that assumption comes from a bias that may have been influenced by bad information or stereotyping. If you have never experienced what others have, ask yourself what you would do. How would you feel? If you are unable to answer the questions yourself, or unable to find answers in your research, ask others. If someone asks for a day off, never make the assumption that they are lazy or just don’t want to work. Be Nice One of the easiest ways to be empathetic is to show kindness. You should always avoid raising your voice or name-calling if there is a conflict or a need to discipline. Always remember how it feels to be on the receiving end of ill behavior. Final Thought Leading with empathy does not mean that you’re creating an opportunity for your employees to walk all over you. It means you’re creating a shared space of understanding and trust. This is the space that will give your team confidence in asking your for time off when they really need it. This is the space where your team will step up to cover shifts because they know the business really needs it. This is the space where difficult conversations can take place and be constructive and productive. With empathy, you will be a better leader and manager, and will earn your team’s respect. So when you need someone to cover a shift, assist a customer, or hire a new employee, fewer obstacles will be in your way. Interested in more effective and easy ways to attract and retain staff?

Make the Switch to Workstream Share this article It was announced last August that Google Hire, will be shut down this coming September (September 1, 2020, to be exact!). This gives your company a little over 3 months to transition to another hiring management platform, lest you fall back on stuffed inboxes and messy spreadsheets. So let’s examine why Google Hire was popular, and why Workstream is the natural next move for businesses who want a similar hiring experience. Ease of Use Almost all Google Hire users agreed that the hiring platform was easy to use, and we know from experience how important simplicity is to busy hiring managers and business owners. It doesn’t really matter how powerful an app is if it’s just tedious or too complicated. Google Hire nailed ease of use, but a large part of that was because it was light on features . Users agree that it covered the absolute basics of a hiring platform: posting to job boards, tracking applicants, and managing the hiring funnel. However, for its short life, Google Hire didn't really add many features to keep it competitive with other products on the market. Workstream was built from the ground up with ease of use at the forefront of user experience, while still providing a robust and expanding feature set. In fact, the goal is to have the manager barely enter the system at all. Using automations such as scheduled text messaging, interview reminders , and AI-enabled screening, users can spend less time managing hiring while still getting better results. But unlike Google Hire, Workstream doesn’t sacrifice features for simplicity . Even though the user interface is extremely intuitive, there’s seamless integrations of features Google didn’t have, including candidate scoring, smart screening questions , more job board integrations, and even onboarding (more on this later). If you liked the simplicity of Google Hire, Workstream is just as simple and even more powerful. G Suite Integration This is a no-brainer. Many small and medium sized businesses run on G Suite and that made Google Hire a logical choice due to its close integration with Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets. But that sort of close integration also leaves many businesses out: businesses that use Microsoft’s suite of products, and businesses that use Apple’s. In fact, there were reports that Google Hire would only properly work on the Google Chrome browser and even on Hire’s own help page , it showed that some features wouldn’t function on Safari on iOS. Workstream’s platform isn’t tied to any one tech giant which means any business can utilize all of its features . Missing G Suite? We’ve got you covered with Google Calendar integration, and you can of course use Gmail for emailing, and export files to be viewed in Google Sheets. Onboarding Google Hire stopped short of the most important aspect of recruiting: the actual hiring. No candidate ever becomes a real employee without actual documentation signed and delivered. While Google Hire helped businesses get to the finish line, it couldn’t handle crossing it. Onboarding is a crucial step to complete the hiring process. Glassdoor showed that a strong onboarding process can increase retention by 82% . That’s why Workstream developed a slew of onboarding features that can put your new relationship with your hire on the best possible terms. For instance, hiring managers can automatically take care of important paperwork including offer letters, W-4 forms, and more. Workstream also offers options to kick off mobile training by sending new hires handbooks and training videos, as well as reminders to complete their training. Hiring doesn’t end with just a virtual handshake. A robust hiring platform like Workstream can guide you through your new employee’s first day and beyond .

Also in this week's highlights, Workstream's Lydia Hall will shed light on how business owners are prepping to reopen after the pandemic. She'll share the stage with a distinguished panel of business owners and operators, plus one VERY fluffy puppy. Don't miss this exclusive webinar! Businesses Reopening: What to expect in the next crucial weeks From Texas to Tennessee, Mississippi to Montana, many states are gearing up to reopen at least some of their non-essential businesses this week such as restaurants, salons, and other retailers. While no state has fully met governmental guidelines to reopen , for example adequate testing and contact tracing, they are tentatively forging ahead anyway in order to save the livelihoods of their communities. Call it foolhardy or brave, these businesses will quickly reveal how and when America at large can reopen. Due to COVID-19's lag in manifesting symptoms , it will take 1-2 weeks to show any spike in illnesses. During this time, business owners in other states and those who've chosen to wait to reopen will be watching to see what happens. Either there will be an increase in hospitalizations, which will lead to prompt reshutterings, or low hospitalization rates leading to a return to the new normal. Either way, it'll be real-world data for those on the sidelines. The Takeaway: Remember, there aren't enough tests to determine an increase in infections. As morbid as it is, business owners must look at the rate of hospitalizations in 1-2 weeks in the newly opened cities to determine whether it is reasonable to get back to work. Everyone needs tech, but tech jobs aren't safe either With Zoom, Amazon, and other tech companies becoming overnight essentials during quarantine, one might expect the technology sector to continue hiring like crazy. Unfortunately, the data doesn't bear that out. According to CNBC's analysis of Glassdoor , job openings in tech have dropped more than 20% between mid-March and mid-April. One reason for the slowdown is that ad revenues are down across the board. Sure, everyone is online right now, but if businesses can't operate, they won't be purchasing ads on Google or Facebook... which is exactly what we're seeing . In fact, Google's CEO said they will \"curtail its hiring for the rest of the year.\" The Takeaway: No vertical is safe and despite your Zooms and Amazons, the tech sector overall is taking a hiring hit. Nowhere near as much as other areas such as hospitality or retail, but enough that there will be a hiring squeeze overall for perhaps the rest of the year. Open Hiring: A new hiring strategy for the new normal Eons ago in February of this year, Forbes wrote about Open Hiring , a seemingly strange way to fill positions on a first-come, first-serve basis. Now, due to the desperation of essential businesses (grocery stores, delivery companies, etc), we are seeing Open Hiring become more widely adopted just for sheer speed and efficiency. Now, you won't see Open Hiring deployed to fill most high-skilled jobs. Law firms aren't going to hire the first slim-fit suit that walks in the door. But for retail and other businesses that train up their employees, Open Hiring is an option that has been shown to not only to speed up onboarding, but lower turnover rates as well . The Takeaway: The current economic crisis is also an opportunity for creative businesses to change their approach to hiring. We're all fans of a faster hiring process, and we'll be watching the Open Hiring movement with great interest. Need help hiring the right people? Workstream can help.

Not only does putting sustainability at the core of your brand attract eco-conscious customers, but it attracts eco-conscious applicants too. Looking for some inspiration from businesses doing it right? Here are the top fast-casual restaurants leading the charge! Just Salad. Just Salad is within the category of best fast casual restaurants that's taken a huge step in the right direction by announcing its Green Standard Initiative, which aims to send 0 waste to landfills by 2022. This is done through their Reusable Bowl Program , favoring more recycled or compostable packaging and organic composting. In that year alone, they achieved 133% year-on-year reusable bowl usage and diverted 75,000 lbs of single-use plastics from landfills through their Reusable Bowl Program. Shake Shack. This brand is highly involved in recycling efforts . Its tables are made from recycled bowling alleys, and it also collects and sorts out all bottles, cardboard, and plastics. The brand uses eco-friendly Sustainable Forestry Initiative-certified paper and prints with soy ink. In terms of sustainable food sourcing, it uses bacon made from humanely and sustainably raised livestock. Panera Bread. Panera has been known as one of the best fast casual restaurants. It launched its “ Food as it should be ” campaign in 2014 to signal the start of its healthy journey to eliminate additives from its menu and serve only clean and sustainable products. For instance, it has pledged to eliminate the use of Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a chemical that can be toxic to humans when used in high concentration, in their baguette bags. Chipotle. Their brand mission is “ Food with integrity .” They only partner with farmers who prioritize the long-term health of their soil and don't use non-therapeutic antibiotics or added hormones in their livestock. Rubio’s. The brand engages in three main types of sustainable efforts: eco-friendly packaging and printing , eco-friendly restaurants, and recycling . Rubio’s also chooses seafood that is sourced sustainably and responsibly. Tender Greens. Sustainability is at the core of all the decisions made at Tender Greens. For starters, all their ingredients are responsibly sourced . But the brand is not only concerned with food sustainability, but also with its operations . They use green detergent and cleaners, biodegradable to-go containers, organic cotton uniforms, and potted herbs that double as cooking ingredients. SweetGreen. SweetGreen is big on sustainability. 100% of their stores have compost services and pickup. On average, they divert 60% of their waste from landfills and compost 75% of their food scraps. Every customer-facing item in their restaurants is certified compostable. This includes forks, lids, bowls, bags, cups, and straws. Chaia Tacos. Chaia is committed to using organic, locally-sourced ingredients. They serve vegetarian food to reduce meat consumption. All food containers are also compostable. Little Sesame. They use responsibly sourced ingredients in their dishes and travel the world to learn the best farming practices. They also cut down on the use of to-go container waste by encouraging customers to dine in. This year, they will provide $5,000 grants to two farms as part of its Little Seedlings program, an annual fellowship program to support farmers who “invest in the future of our planet.” HipCityVeg. Serving vegan burgers, salads, and frozen bowls (made from locally sourced ingredients) in compostable serving packaging, HipCityVeg is one of the top fast casual restaurants 100% committed to its sustainability goals. Apart from that, its furniture is made with salvaged wood and recycled plastic, and deliveries are even made via bikes. As you can see, so many of the top fast-casual restaurants are making a strong commitment to sustainability.

But, it’s rarely done well (if at all). The stark reality is that 75% of candidates never hear back from potential employers after applying for a job. This means candidates are being ghosted by potential employers at an alarmingly high rate. There’s no question that it can be difficult for some district (DMs) and general managers (GMs) to give feedback to candidates after they’ve been rejected for the position—especially given the demands on their time. And, on top of that, sharing bad news with people (even when coupled with positive feedback) isn’t enjoyable. But whether the feedback is positive or negative, it’s important that you and your team prioritize timely and respectful communication with your candidates. It’s critical to your restaurant’s reputation and long-term hiring success. When should you give job candidates feedback? 1. In preparation for interviews A great opportunity to give candidates feedback is right from the get-go, by providing guidance on several aspects of the interview they may be curious about. For starters, most candidates will be curious about what kinds of questions they might be asked. It can be helpful and productive for both parties if you share some of these questions with candidates before the interview. This allows them to bring to the interview examples from their professional lives that they can share with you. Sharing some of the questions in advance also shows candidates that you care about their success during an interview, which they will appreciate. In addition to providing some of the interview questions, it’s also helpful to address the small, practical details of their interview. It may seem insignificant, but it means a lot to candidates to receive guidance on how to dress for the interview, what they should bring and where they should go to meet the hiring manager. It’s also a great idea to use professionally written, automated text messages for interview reminders for candidates so that you can cut down on no-shows and put a tech-savvy foot forward for your brand. 2. During status updates As candidates progress through the hiring process, keep them updated on what’s happening behind the scenes. Be sure to let them know how they did in their interview. The longer candidates go without hearing from you, the less interested they become. Worse yet, if candidates haven’t heard back from you with next steps, they may simply move on to your competitor down the street. If there is a next step in the hiring process on the horizon, be sure to give the candidates an approximate timeline. The more informed and up-to-date candidates are with your brand, the more likely they will remain responsive and engaged in the process. To easily manage the large number of status updates you have to send out during the hiring process, use an automated hiring technology that does the heavy lifting of notifications for you. 3. Once a final decision has been made The time has finally come to make the decision on whether to hire the candidate. It’s very important to give all candidates feedback at this point regardless of whether they got the job. For candidates you don’t end up hiring, it is imperative to handle these communications with a degree of delicacy. Remember, these candidates could apply again in the future, they can influence other candidates in your community and some might even be customers at your restaurant. The last thing you want to do is burn a bridge by not giving feedback or giving feedback that is unthoughtful or even hurtful. When giving feedback to candidates you don’t hire, make sure you have a balance of positive feedback as well as constructive. Additionally, make sure you communicate how much you appreciate the time and effort they invested into the hiring process with your team. For candidates you do hire, provide them with a balance of positive feedback and areas for improvement too. You should clearly express a spirit of excitement and eagerness for them to join your team. At the same time, you should begin to prepare them for the realities of how they will need to improve to ensure they can succeed at your restaurant. Set your QSR apart from the competition with robust feedback With many QSRs neglecting the feedback loop during the hiring process, you have an opportunity to gain an advantage in the highly-competitive job market. Even if your DMs and GMs haven’t made a final decision on whom to hire, make sure you have a system in place for sending text messages to keep your candidates engaged. The waiting periods between interviews or assessments are great opportunities to share compelling content with candidates on brand values, information about the culture of the team or goals for the restaurant for the coming year. As a VP of operations, how do you know if your DMs and GMs are giving candidates enough feedback during the hiring process? One of the best ways to find out is by conducting a routine survey with your candidates during the hiring process. The surveys will reveal the strengths in your hiring process—and areas you can improve in partnership with your DMs and GMs. A survey is also a good way to gauge how professional your restaurant’s hiring process is from candidates’ point of view. If you’re ready to set your QSR apart from the competition and step up your feedback game with your job candidates, Workstream is here to help!

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that COVID-19 is spreading easily and sustainably in affected areas, a phenomenon known as ‘community spreading.’ Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has shared his insights on why the situation will get worse . With that in mind, as many businesses are highly dependent on a physical consumer base, restaurants need to step up efforts to curb the spread of the virus. Here’s how some fast food restaurants are doing this. McDonald’s McDonald’s USA President Joe Erlinger announced that the fast food giant has ramped up its sanitation procedures. On top of regular deep-cleaning procedures, McDonald’s will increase deep-cleaning frequencies at high touch areas . These include ordering kiosks, pick-up counters, and restrooms. McDelivery procedures will also be enhanced to ensure that packaging remains sterile before food is put into it. In terms of the well-being of hourly workers, Erlinger said that McDonald’s USA would support employees in staying home if they are sick. The chain has announced that corporate-owned restaurant employees would be provided up to 14 days of paid sick leave should they need to be quarantined. Starbucks The coffee franchise giant said that workers who suspect that they were exposed to the virus are eligible for 14 days of catastrophe pay . This is on top of other benefits like sick pay, vacation pay, and personal time off . In terms of improving hygiene, Starbucks has increased cleaning and sanitization for all company-operated stores and paused the use of personal cups. In terms of social distancing, the brand put in place a temporary nationwide “to go” model in which it will close down sitting in all its cafe and patio areas. Locations in “high-social gathering locations” will also be closed. Chick-fil-A According to Chick-fil-A’s President Tim Tassopoulos, disinfecting procedures have been ramped up . The brand initially only implemented some operational changes including a closure of playgrounds, serving all meals in carry-out packing and halting the provision of a printed menu at drive-thrus. However, most recently, Chick-fil-A announced a temporary closure of dining room seating . Some of the restaurants will only offer services via drive-thrus or takeout, delivery, and mobile order. Taco Bell Taco Bell has announced that it is considering closing dining rooms in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The fast food chain said that it is in the midst of changing its operations to only serve customers via drive-thrus and delivery . This is done of course to increase social distancing efforts. In order to support its employees in these difficult times, Taco Bell’s CEO Mark King said that employees who are required to stay at home or those working at a restaurant that needs to be closed will all be paid. Shake Shack Shake Shack’s CEO Randy Garutti said that the burger chain is stepping up its sanitization efforts. Sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer stations would be placed in stores, and all condiments and utensils will be distributed by its employees. All mobile and to-go orders will also be placed in a new, fully sealed bag . In terms of employee well-being, all members of the Shake Shack team are offered sick pay . Garutti has hinted that the brand will continue to adapt to the situation as it progresses, indicating that we may see certain branches “ adjusting hours or modifying our operations .” TAGS Recruiting strategies Nigel Seah Nigel is not just a marketer at Workstream, he is also a graduate of Psychology and Marketing of Singapore Management University.

At Disney, however, hourly workers are in the spotlight, as they roll out a new program that aims to provide the gift of education to as many as 80,000 employees. The Walt Disney Co. announced that they will pay full tuition for their hourly workers so that they can have a proper education, learn new skills, and evolve as individuals alongside Disney, but also if they wish to, beyond the giant entertainment company. \"I have always believed that education is the key to opportunity. It opens doors and creates new possibilities,\" said Bob Iger, Disney Chairman and CEO. And indeed it does - education can pave the way to plenty more opportunities for these hourly workers. This new program, named Disney Aspire, will give employees the means to achieve their personal goals - something that Disney is known to value. The educational program is designed solely for hourly workers and will cater to cast members and employees of The Walt Disney Company, offering them a chance to finish their high school diploma, get specialized training, or even pursue a university degree, \"We can't wait to see what paths our cast members take with Disney Aspire,\" the company said. Disney announced an initial $50 million investment in this new and ongoing project. The fund will be used to cover 100 percent of the tuition fee up front, along with all the required learning materials. Jayne Parker, senior executive vice president & chief HR officer for The Walt Disney Company, says that he wants to support employees in their professional and personal careers. The important thing is to give people an opportunity to express their needs, realize their ambitions, and follow their dreams. He also says that the program is designed to be fully flexible – employees have all the freedom in choosing what they would like to pursue, regardless of whether the programs are related to their current role at Disney. Disney has partnered with Guild Education, an organization whose main goal is to change the future of adult education and work. The Guild is providing teachers to guide employees through the program and help them evolve from it. The first lessons will be conducted online. With this development and employee retention technique, Disney is looking to develop their workers' potential to the point where they can become full-time employees through training and education. This strategy isn’t new - other big corporations have made similar implementations, such as Walmart, which initiated an educational project which provides a degree from three different universities through the online program. This opportunity presented by Disney and other big companies is a huge step for hourly workers. It gives people an opportunity to get an education that they didn't have before, a chance to evolve. A program that allows people to get a university degree while still keeping their job is a crucial step for hourly workers. It's a smart business move, and employee retention strategy. Give people the chance to pursue their personal development, and they are more likely to work harder for the company as a means to repay that investment in their future. Workstream's Recruiting Tip: Even if your organization may not have sufficient funds to support such a large-scale venture in the current moment, there are ways that you can start small. Take mobile training for example, consider implementing online materials and resources such as handbooks, checklists, and training videos for employees to access anytime and anywhere. By providing them materials relevant to your company, they will be able to gain additional knowledge, be it on customer service or values, and this effectively serves as personal development too! This will help in empowering workers, and helping them stay connected to your company and what you stand for, and can also help in improving employee retention. From Disney's example, we can see how big corporations and companies can help their workers. Smaller businesses can also examine this project and follow their lead by emulating what it hopes to achieve - creating a great working environment and culture where hourly employees can feel supported and nurtured, so that they are better motivated to succeed. We hope that more companies follow the example set by Disney and Walmart, and prioritize the development of their hourly employees, especially since hourly workers provide an invaluable service to any business workforce.

That’s how many Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in November 2021! It’s a record-breaking number that’s a hard hit on industries that were already struggling with a national labor shortage amid the pandemic . Many managers are wondering how to retain employees, and for good reason. Restaurant turnover rates were high even pre- pandemic . Of the 4.5 million workers who quit in November, 6.1% worked in the hospitality industry. So, in 2023, it’s time for you to face this problem head-on. And we want to help. That’s why, in this article, we’ll be looking at the best ways to retain employees by discussing: Some of the top reasons why restaurant turnover rates are so high Ten employee retention plans to help you keep the employees you already have Let’s get right into it. Why is there a shortage of restaurant workers? The economy is struggling, and yes, the folks who'd usually be serving up your favorite dishes do need jobs. So, what's up with all these \"Help Wanted\" signs and the revolving door of restaurant staff? You might think it's a case of laziness or living off unemployment. No, it's more nuanced than that. Turns out, a lot of people are jumping ship for remote work , looking for better work-life balance and employee perks . Here are some of the top reasons that restaurant turnover rates are so high: Low wages and inadequate benefits Low wages and inadequate benefits have long been a sticking point in the restaurant industry. Even pre- pandemic , there was a clamor for a $15/hour minimum wage, and that noise has only grown louder in the face of economic instability. And let's not even get started on the bare-bones benefits—many fast-food joints don't offer essentials like paid sick leave or health insurance . Here's the kicker: while restaurant folks are fighting for basic healthcare and a living wage, other industries are rolling out the red carpet for top talent . We're talking competitive compensation , flexible schedules , and a whole menu of perks that make it hard for team members to resist jumping ship. From LinkedIn to Forbes , studies are showing that effective employee retention strategies are not just about money; they're about employee engagement , professional development , and a healthy work-life balance . So, it's no wonder employee turnover is high when new hires can find all these incentives in a new job elsewhere. With issues like these, it's not just about resignations ; it's a full-blown attrition crisis. Long working hours Long working hours have become the norm in many eateries, especially with staffing levels at an all-time low. Restaurant workers are clocking in extra hours and pulling double shifts, sometimes out of necessity, other times because there's just no one else. Add to that the extra burden the pandemic went and placed on everyone—like caring for sick family members—and you've got a recipe for burnout . But let's not forget, it's not just about the grind. The lack of work-life balance is a major red flag for top performers seeking new opportunities . Companies that get props on Gallup and LinkedIn offer not just good pay but also initiatives focused on employee well-being and flexible work options . It's a full package deal that prioritizes employee satisfaction and wellness . Stressful work environment The stressful environment in restaurants was further aggravated last year by public reactions to pandemic -related measures like mask mandates and social distancing. Instances of aggressive customers verbally or even physically assaulting workers were unfortunately not uncommon. Many employees understandably reached a breaking point, deciding that the job just wasn't worth it. In contrast, last year saw human resource departments in other industries making strides in elevating employee morale and satisfaction. Mentorship initiatives , team-building activities, and recognition programs became standard practices to retain the best employees . These motivators not only improved the overall employee experience but also positively impacted employee retention rates . Given the challenges of the past, it's hardly surprising that workers are departing restaurants for sectors where their well-being and teamwork are more highly valued. Jobs in different industries The allure of restaurant jobs has significantly waned, prompting workers to explore greener pastures in diverse fields like offices, education, and warehouses, among others. Last year alone, a staggering 15% of hourly workers made the leap to different industries, and another 33% are keen to follow suit. The shift isn't merely about escaping the restaurant scene; it's also about seeking more fulfilling career paths . These alternative sectors often offer structured mentorship programs that help guide new hires and existing staff alike. Moreover, there's a greater focus on upskilling , facilitated by constructive employee feedback . This creates an environment where workers can not only earn a paycheck but also grow professionally, thereby enriching their employment experience. How to retain employees - 10 strategies Given the complexities driving the restaurant labor shortage, doubling down on employee retention isn't just smart, it's essential. Effective retention strategies not only help you keep your current workforce but also make your establishment more attractive to prospective, high-quality employees. So, let's dive into 10 actionable strategies to bolster employee retention in 2023: 1. Increase wages Undoubtedly, higher wages are the top-of-mind desire for most workers at the moment. It's the most concrete way to signal to your team that you appreciate their efforts and want to retain them. While you may not be able to implement across-the-board raises immediately, targeted pay increases for your hardest-working employees can make a significant impact. Here's a tip: consider involving mentors in the process of identifying which team members are truly excelling and deserving of a wage boost. This not only brings experienced perspectives into the decision but also emphasizes the importance of mentorship in your work culture. Also, if you find yourself faced with a departing employee , utilize that opportunity to reassess the compensation structure and understand if wages were a factor in their decision to leave. This can offer invaluable insights for your retention strategies moving forward. 2. Offer better benefits According to a 2019 survey , only 31% of restaurants offered health insurance to their employees. Offering insurance amid a global health crisis would definitely incentivize your workers to stay with you. But health insurance isn’t the only benefit that workers care about. You can also consider offering benefits like paid sick leave, stipends for child care, free meals, cash bonuses or education assistance programs. 3. Show support for mental health Workers in all industries are experiencing burnout right now. Your employees are no exception. So, acknowledge the stress they’re under. Expose them to free or affordable mental health resources . Encourage breaks and transparency about what parts of the job are most mentally taxing. These things won’t erase the problems your employees face. But they will show them that you care. 4. How to retain employees through flexible pay schedules You’re now competing with the gig economy where workers can make and receive their money fast. To keep up, consider adopting technology like Tapcheck that allows employees to gain access to their earnings whenever they want. According to Tapcheck, giving your workers the option for on-demand pay can also lead to increased productivity, lower HR expenses and a boost in company profits. 5. Create a safe workplace In 2023, the emphasis has shifted from pandemic -specific measures to overall safety and well-being . Your employees need to feel safe and respected to continue working for you. Implement training programs that address conflict resolution and educate your team on how to manage difficult or unruly customers. If difficult customers are a frequent issue, consider hiring a security guard or installing surveillance systems to add an extra layer of safety. Signage can also be used to remind customers of policies that protect both them and the staff, such as a zero-tolerance policy on harassment or violence. By taking these steps, you can create an environment that respects the dignity and safety of your employees. 6. Show appreciation In challenging times within the service industry, showing genuine appreciation for your employees stands out as one of the best ways to retain employees. Knowing they are valued for their hard work can be the decisive factor that motivates staff to endure hardships and stay committed to their roles. Publicly acknowledging your employees' contributions not only reinforces their significance to your organization but also serves as a morale booster for the entire team. While financial incentives like bonuses and raises are impactful, never underestimate the power of personalized gestures like a handwritten thank you card. These acts can often make a lasting impression, emphasizing that you genuinely care for and appreciate your team. 7. How to retain employees through strong company culture Company culture plays an important role in keeping employees engaged at work. On top of that, a strong company culture can lead to increased productivity and overall job satisfaction . You can build a strong culture among workers by offering career development opportunities , regularly asking for feedback, and improving communication between management and staff. 8. Reassess your onboarding process Your onboarding process can have a long-lasting impact on newly hired employees’ job performance and retention. In fact, according to one report, an efficient onboarding process can increase the retention rate by 82% . So, after you’ve implemented the above strategies to retain your current employees , take time to also improve your onboarding process . Look for ways to ensure your workers achieve early success and feel confident in their roles. 9. Improve your hiring process You won’t have to worry as much about new employees quitting if you’re clear on expectations and effectively assess cultural fit during the hiring process. Doing so will help you filter out applicants who don’t show potential to stay with you long-term. But how can you achieve this? By being transparent about things like work responsibilities, compensation, and other benefits during the application and interview process. You should also make sure you’re asking restaurant interview questions that are relevant to your restaurant’s current working conditions. 10. Identify the root causes during exit interviews When employees do quit, take advantage of the opportunity to find out the reasons why by strategically conducting exit interviews . Of course, it may be too late to retain employees at this stage. But you can use the information you learn during these interviews to make relevant improvements for the employees that stay. How to retain employees - final thoughts Right now, there’s no way to know how long the restaurant labor shortage will last. But by proactively improving your retention strategies, you can reduce your turnover rate and avoid later being short-staffed. Try out the 10 tips we’ve shared in this post: Increase wages Offer better benefits Show support for mental health Offer flexible pay schedules Create a safe workplace Show appreciation Strengthen the company culture Reassess your onboarding process Improve your hiring process Identify the root causes during exit interviews And for more tips like these, be sure to also check out our recent posts on how to run a restaurant after the Covid-19 pandemic .

Learning to filter these data points to focus on the information that matters most is a skill that QSR leaders need to understand. In a world where you can learn hundreds of facts about your business in a few clicks of a mouse, it’s time to get focused on the metrics that will have the most impact on your business and promote growth in the best way possible. In this article, we’ll explain the seven HR metrics you need to keep an eye on to run an effective restaurant. What are HR metrics? Why are they important? Human resources metrics are key data points that you can track to understand how your company is doing when it comes to the people on your team. HR has become data-rich with the help of HR technology companies. Your business can now understand how you can best support employees with the click of a mouse instead of shuffling through hundreds of papers or talking with staff members one-on-one. When armed with the correct information, you can make significant, positive changes at work. 7 HR metrics top QSR brands must measure While you might have access to hundreds of metrics as operations director or hiring manager, you should pare down what you measure and focus on. Let's cover the seven HR metrics your QSR brand needs to measure and report on often. 1. Cost per hire One of the first metrics restaurants should track is cost per hire. Hiring is expensive, especially because turnover in the food service industry is much higher than in most industries . If you can lower your cost per hire, you can keep up with turnover numbers while keeping your personnel expenses in check. When examining your cost per hire, you are trying to find a sweet spot between high-quality and low-cost candidates. Where are you finding your best, long-standing employees? Where do you find employees who require the least upfront cost? For example, you might find that your highest quality employees come from referrals, social media, and a job board you enjoy. Hopefully, those strategies are also cost-effective for your company. If they are, continue to invest in those recruitment strategies. By diving into the HR data your company has, you should find a happy medium to invest your hiring dollars. 2. Employee retention rate After you determine your cost per hire, it’s time to turn your attention to employee retention rate. Keeping your employees longer makes a huge difference. It’s hard to grow your business if you are consistently backfilling positions you have already hired for. When you track this HR KPI, you have to think about two types of employee retention: New hire turnover : Employees who decide to leave shortly after joining the company (you can set the timeline for this, a typical timeline is within 3-6 months after being hired.) Voluntary turnover : Any voluntary separation from your organization after the new hire turnover timeline you set. Tracking both new hire and voluntary turnover can help you better manage your roster. Once you have this information, you can better understand the likelihood of a team member staying on board. Companies who understand this HR metric can also find ways to improve their retention rate by conducting stay and exit interviews with employees. 3. Absence rate Absenteeism causes a domino effect in the restaurant industry. Frequent absenteeism can burnout your loyal employees, make them more likely to call out or even make them leave your organization. Employees who are frequently absent become lackluster team members, and they may struggle to keep up with tasks while working. When calculating absenteeism at work, it’s essential to break your absences into several categories: Excused absences : Absences covered by a doctor’s visit, jury duty or some other valid excuse. The employee and manager also agreed upon these absences. Unexcused absences : Absences that were not covered by an excuse but were agreed upon by the employee and manager. No call/No shows : Absences that were not planned or agreed upon by the employee and manager. Planned absences : Vacations, while not a genuine absence, need to be monitored so you can ensure you have sufficient staff to cover someone leaving for a few days or a week. Once you understand the flow of your absences, you can develop creative solutions to make sure that your team feels supported. For example, some companies have a standby pool of workers they can call to cover absences if they need the extra help. 4. Cost of overtime Overtime can be a drain on your expenses. You need to pay time and a half for any overtime you elect to give an employee most of the time. If you know overtime will continue to be necessary, it might make more financial sense to hire another employee to cover the hours. If you pay any group of employees more than 27 hours in overtime a week, it may make more sense to pay an employee for 40 hours of regular work. This is because if someone works 27 hours of overtime, you will pay them for 40.5 hours of work due to time and a half laws. Look at the trends in overtime at your company. Are you consistently having employees work several hours of overtime every week? How much does your employee benefits package cost? Do the math so you can see if it’s worth it to keep offering overtime or increase the size of your team . 5. Workforce demographics Creating equity at work starts with understanding the demographics of your workforce. Understanding demographics like gender, race, pay, department, age, disability, veteran status, etc., can make a world of difference. By gathering this information, you can make more informed decisions about pay gaps or benefits you should offer employees. HR leaders need to understand the demographics of their workforce to make sure that employees are represented appropriately and working in an environment that serves them. The small actions of making sure that women are adequately paid or that older employees can thrive at your store make your company a better place to work. 6. Employee engagement Keeping employees engaged helps you improve employee retention dramatically. If you aren’t keeping up with engagement, it’s simpler than you think. First, you’ll want to pick a strategy for understanding employee engagement. Some companies use Gallup’s Q12 survey , while others use eNPS to calculate workplace engagement. Whichever method you choose, stick with it, so it’s easy to understand and take action on. Once you receive feedback from employees, tackle the lowest scoring items or the concepts employees talk about most before doing anything else. Addressing the most critical issues will help you take action on the HR metrics you get from this survey. 7. Rehire/Boomerang rate When hiring in a small market, you have to find new ways to hire. For example, we believe that every QSR needs an internal hiring strategy . Another strategy you need to develop is a rehire or boomerang employee strategy. Sometimes stellar employees leave your organization to pursue other career opportunities, but they don’t have to be ex-employees forever. Boomerang hires know a lot about your organization, and they can be the perfect addition to your roster. Creating a strategy that helps you appeal to past employees and bring them back on board is crucial to your restaurant's local success. Start tracking the amount of rehires you make. How are you reengaging with these past employees? When you can track this information, you can strategically find and rehire more past employees. Conclusion: Creating productive QSR employees by using HR metrics Are you ready to create a workplace where restaurant employees can thrive? You will have all the information you need to create an environment that employees are delighted to work in by tracking HR metrics. Once you track the data, make sure you spend time acting on it. Observe the data? Are there 2-3 tweaks you can make that will immediately improve your team's experience at work? Your job as a manager is to observe what could help your team thrive and commit to getting it done.

Instead of cutting back on hiring, they seized the opportunity to hire engineers from closing U.S. military bases . Founders David Packard and Bill Hewlett would later always attribute HP’s success to their willingness to invest in talent no matter the circumstances. Jumping forward to the 21st century, almost 80 years later, we face yet another global crisis. As of May 12 2020, more than half the number of states in the US have either partially reopened their businesses or plan to reopen soon . Only 15 states remain in lockdown mode. As states slowly start to reopen their economies, businesses are working on a tight schedule to bring back employees who were laid off or furloughed. More than 33 million Americans were either laid off or furloughed as a result of the pandemic. This provides a pool of talent larger than any we’ve ever seen before in recent years. How then are you going to filter for the best candidates to join your team? Know Your Aid It’s clear by now that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) has been less than adequate in helping businesses survive this crisis. Some of the more concerning requirements for your loans to be forgiven are as follows: At least 75% of the loan must be for payroll costs You can’t decrease your full-time employee headcount You can’t decrease salaries/wages by more than 25%, for employees making less than $100,000 Here are some questions to think about: What if you still can’t open for business? Even when quarantine is lifted, businesses will be mandated to reopen at reduced capacity. So how do you hire back your entire staff to meet the terms of loan forgiveness? And with reduced capacity, can you afford to pay them even 75% of their previous paycheck? What if the employees don’t want to come back to work due to safety concerns? It seems like business owners have reached a dead end. Thankfully, other forms of aid in the form of federal tax credits are available. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) grants employers tax credit if they hire individuals from certain targeted groups who traditionally faced a lot of difficulties when seeking employment. The amount of tax credit that can be claimed ranges from $1,200 to $9,600. You can complete the claiming process in just 5 simple steps . Adapt Your Hiring Process Before you even begin to make hiring decisions, make sure you are well-versed in the new coronavirus-related regulations you need to abide by when it comes to conducting business operations. Your hiring process is no exception. With social distancing set as the new norm, ask yourself: “Do I really need to have that one candidate come in for an interview?” The interview process for many MNCs’ management roles may put several candidates in the same room to have them collaborate and solve a task together. Is the role you are looking to hire for a managerial one that is highly collaborative in nature? Does it require that decisions be made at breakneck speed lest you risk the collapse of the global supply chain of a top international conglomerate? If your answer is no, then it is unlikely that you’ll need to meet the candidate in person. Conducting video interviews via video conferencing software like Zoom or Skype will suffice. This can even provide you with new criteria for selecting candidates. According to Jerome Chang , Founder of co-working space BlankSpaces , looking at the way a person dresses for a video interview and how they set up their backgrounds can reveal more about who they are as people. Hire the RIGHT Employees You don’t want to hire more employees. You want to hire the right ones - those who will stay beyond the crisis and believe in your brand. As our Head of Marketing and Growth Lydia Fayal said, “Nobody wants a temporary accountant,” especially not during a period where manpower is more precious than ever. So how can you filter out those candidates who are simply using your business as a stepping stone? In a webinar about thriving in a COVID-19 world, Recruiting Manager at ZeroCater Theresa Morgan said that it is not enough to just ask why the applicant is looking for a job. You also need to ask about what candidates find important in the next steps of their careers. This would not only give you insight on why they're looking but what they want. It helps you pair them up with your opportunity. More than ever, it is essential to be clear about your company’s mission and values. Hiring managers can use that to find candidates whose values and modes of thinking and operation are aligned with your own. You can come up with several scenario-based questions to try to obtain insights on the candidates’ way of thinking. To Conclude Let’s jump right back into the mid-twentieth century when HP was on the brink of collapse - to that very moment when its founders were in the process of making that tough decision on whether or not to recruit new talent in times of recession. Many of you are probably in the same spot now. Should you be taking a less risky path or go all out and get the best to join your team? We know that it is a tough decision to make, and we are here to help. Unlike Hewlett and Packard, you have the luxury of modern technology and an abundance of data to make better business decisions. Knowing which financial resources are up for grabs, adapting your hiring process, and looking for the right talent are some of the ways you can adapt your hiring strategy in this COVID-19 world. Workstream can help you navigate the minefield that is the current hiring landscape. Schedule your demo today to find out how you can leverage our end-to-end contactless hiring platform.

With drastic changes in consumer patterns, dining behavior, and safety guidelines, there is a need for QSRs to transform their pre-Covid routines to stay relevant. However, with an onslaught of information, data and statistics online, it may seem overwhelming to QSR owners. Some may have to make drastic changes to their stores while hiring sufficient staff to meet demands. For simplicity, we’ve summarized some key trends and data, which will hopefully help you in gearing up your QSR for the new normal. They’ll be broken down into three main sections: Consumer Behavior, Digital Transformation, and Recruitment. Consumer Behavior How exactly has consumer behavior changed, and what do your customers expect from your QSR when it reopens? It is important to understand their perspective, to retain customers, and draw in new ones. Expectations have shifted as people are increasingly aware of health risks, and many hope that QSRs have put in sufficient measures in place to reduce the spread of the virus. Expectations of a Restaurant Types of PPE worn Both masks and gloves: 61.9% Only Masks: 24% Only Gloves: 14.1% How long should staff wear PPE (After reopening) Minimally 30 days: 39.1% 60 days: 20.8% Most customers expect QSRs to adhere to health regulations and enforce the donning of PPE for staff. The majority of respondents believe that both masks and gloves are crucial and that PPE should be worn for minimally 30 days after the QSR has reopened. Keeping this in mind, prepare your QSR by ensuring that all staff members are equipped with PPE, to keep both staff and customers safe, and grant both parties peace of mind. Restaurant Traffic Significant fall in on-premise diners contributing to sales Before: 80% March 2020: 70% Now: 43% Firehouse Subs Case Study (% of people dining in) 2014: Below 50% 2016: 46.5% 2019: 38% Preference for dining in (How often do they plan to dine in) Same as before: 50.9% Less than before: 45.9% There is a significant fall in preference for on-premise dining, as more customers are wary about potential health risks. Fast-casual restaurants saw a 5 percentage point decline in dine-in, up to a high of 17 percentage point drop for some quick-service brands. It is inevitable that on-premise dining is not the go-to option for customers, and QSRs will have to pivot their business. Traditional Channel of Trade Firehouse Subs Case Study (% sales generated by customers at the cashier) 2012: 89.5% 2019: 75.3% Omni-channel opportunities Omni customers spend $122 per order, vs in-store of $47 per customer 160% increase in sales through omnichannel More people are not just making payment at the counter, with the rise of mobile payment and other means of getting food. QSRs will have to embrace omnichannel marketing, with the rise of online ordering, third-party delivery, drive-thrus, and mobile ordering. A greater preference for different channels means that QSRs can uncover the potential of greater spending by creating a seamless omnichannel experience for their customers. Lines and Wait Times 85% of consumers will consider or outright leave a perceived long line 50% will delete apps if they have long wait times on-premise The good news is that omnichannel marketing also accounts for this, effectively reducing wait times and lines, if customers are allowed to make their orders online and pick them up when the food is ready. Shorter wait times also mean happier customers! One example is allowing a customer to purchase through a mobile application, alerting them when the food is ready for collection, and rewarding them with points after they’ve picked up their food. Digital Transformation Panasonic conducted a survey that included 150 Food Services and Food Retail decision-makers in the U.S. and Canada - where 100% of respondents stated that Covid-19 has increased their urgency to adopt transformational technologies . Additionally, 78% indicated that contactless payments are much greater in demand - with the rise of (1) curbside pickup, (2) drive-thrus, and (3) mobile purchases. Let’s take a look at these areas in more detail, based on surveys conducted by Bluedot.IO and VIPInsiders . Curbside Pickup Usage (Bluedot.IO) 60% have used it in the past month (May 2021) Fall in frequency, compared to 80% (Feb 2021) Preferences - How likely are customers to use it? (VIPInsiders) Somewhat likely (34.4%) Very likely (31.9%) Extremely likely (18.2%) It is evident that despite the fall in usage of curbside pickup, curbside delivery is still an essential offering that customers are likely to rely on. This is especially crucial in times where on-premise dining is regulated or disallowed, making it a good backup plan where businesses will not be impacted even with regulations in place. Drive-Thrus 51% of respondents are more likely to visit a QSR if they have a drive-thru 34% more likely to add more menu items at a drive-thru Drive-thrus are a popular option, as it increases the chances of customers choosing to visit your QSR. As an added bonus, it might even increase sales as 34% are more likely to add menu items when visiting a drive-thru. Many QSR giants, such as McDonald’s and Chipotle , have also been exploring automation, innovation and are adding more drive-thrus in a bid to improve the attractiveness and meet demands. Mobile Purchases Nearly 60% of all online searches are now carried out on a mobile device, with some sectors (QSRs) reaching 72%. 40% will download the app to order via one-click Build an app for fast and easy use, entice with deals and coupons, earn and track, easy payment, bypass long line 68% order directly from restaurant apps multiple times a month 75% of customers want offers to be sent to them via text message More customers want to make orders quickly, and on the go, and the fastest way to do so is through a mobile application. With most online searches conducted on a mobile device, mobile applications are the fastest way to a consumer’s heart (and wallet). With a majority of customers ordering directly from restaurant applications multiple times a month, it is a great opportunity to engage your customers, collect information on their preferences and provide loyalty points. This effectively ties in with how to market offers to customers , as 35% of customers prefer loyalty and rewards programs, followed closely by 27.1% for text message marketing and 23.2% who choose social media. Furthermore, mobile applications will also reduce waiting times, as customers can make orders on the go, drop by to collect the food when it’s done without having to factor in food preparation and queueing. This is especially important since many have limited time in between meetings or commute, and every second matter. Recruiting Finally, how exactly should you hire a sufficiently large army of staff to meet the demands when your QSR reopens? Apart from creative job postings , here are some hiring trends you should know, because these will help in attracting new workers, or ensuring that you can retain your current employees. What hourly workers want 53% were hesitant or declined to apply to new jobs due to fear of exposure 70% want the ability to communicate and schedule shifts via a mobile device 94% said accessing their pay before payday would be helpful Fear and Exposure To alleviate their concerns, show your staff (and potential candidates) that your QSR is doing its part in enforcing safety standards across the boards. Adequate PPE for staff, frequent cleaning, and disinfecting, and safety distancing measures can be implemented in your restaurant. Additionally, you may even go the extra mile to take precautions during the hiring process. Virtual interviews can be conducted through video conferences, such that candidates will only have to attend a face-to-face interview in the final stages. This reduces unnecessary exposure and contact. Mobile scheduling and communication Consider mobile training , which ensures that new candidates can access training videos and other materials anytime through their smartphones. These materials can be sent to both new hires and existing employees, and hiring managers will also be able to instantly review completion rates, and send SMS reminders to guarantee completion. Accessing pay before payday Explore applications such as Branch , that will allow workers to access wages instantly, instead of having to wait for their paycheck every month. Some QSRs such as Dominos, Taco Bell, and Dunkin' , have established partnerships that allow employees to have faster access to their earnings, at up to 50% of their paycheck. This reduces instances of them borrowing from high-interest creditors to make payments, lowering finance-induced emotional stress on the workers, and will also help them in managing their cash flow. In summary, it is crucial to understand these data and trends, before applying them in the context of your QSR to better prepare for reopening in these times. With rapidly changing customer behaviors, it is important to understand what customers and employees want from your QSR to be able to meet their needs and successfully gain their trust. This is then enhanced through the adoption of digital transformation.

For the last quarter of 2020, however, it seems that the cost of labor in the US saw an unexpectedly higher jump of 0.7% as compared to the previous quarter. Needless to say, predictions of accelerated inflation for the year came true. And now, quick-service restaurant (QSR) owners have to grapple with the fact that this leads to higher expenses in their business operations. To make things worse, some QSRs are still getting used to the new normal brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising costs are definitely not helping, to say the least. With such terrible circumstances, something’s got to give, right? Well, yes. But take note - one thing that you do not want to do is cutting your staff as this will affect the quality of your customer experience. Importance of Customer Experience The customer or guest experience is vital to you as it can make or break your company’s image. So trust us when we say that you never want to compromise your customer experience as a means to deal with your company’s rising costs. Doing so may actually bring more harm than good for your brand in the long run. So why exactly do we insist that you provide an exceptional experience for your customers? For one, a satisfied customer contributes 2.6 times more revenue than a somewhat satisfied customer. Naturally, customers have a higher chance of becoming loyal ones (and thus spending more money in your store) when they have a good experience in your restaurant. That in itself provides an opportunity for you to stand out from other brands. Moreover, with more competitors cropping up in the market today, you do not want to be known as the restaurant with lousy service and risk losing your existing customers. What’s more, words travel really fast with the rise of social media. A few customers’ bad experiences are enough to deter potential new customers from patronizing your restaurant. Now that you understand the importance of preserving your customer experience, let us bring you some ways you can adopt to offset those high, pesky labor costs you can’t avoid. Ways to Offset Rising Labor Costs Getting the Right Hires First and foremost, you would want to ensure that you are hiring the right person for the job. Look for someone who has the relevant skills for the position or the willingness to learn them as they would be able to complete their delegated tasks more efficiently. Additionally, you would want to hire someone who is the right fit for your company culturally. Neglecting this can cost you more as you might be spending time and resources in training the new hire only to have them leave after a short period of time due to the mismatch of values. At Workstream, we use smart screening to determine if an applicant is the right person for the job before you meet them for an interview. Applicants will have to answer a series of questions and depending on their answers, they will either be automatically moved to the next round or rejected. These screening questions are also customizable so that you can easily set your own requirements based on the job position you are hiring for. The key takeaway here is this - invest in your hiring process to ensure that you are getting the right person for the job. This reduces the likelihood of the new hire quitting after a short while, which in turn minimizes additional cost incurred to rehire for the position. As they say, prevention is always better than cure! Use Energy-Efficient Appliances What better way to offset higher labor costs by being green at the same time? If you are still using out-of-date equipment in your restaurants, consider cutting your overhead costs by switching to equipment which are energy-saving. By practicing such green habits, you are also likely to improve your staff and guest satisfaction at the same time. One particular avenue in which you can cut your energy usage is through the HVAC system . Since it does not have to be completely replaced to produce new savings, it serves as one of the most cost-effective ways for you to reduce your expenses. Transformative Wave’s new Cobalt building management system , for example, uses IoT so that restaurant owners have more control over their HVAC systems. They provide different automated functions such as advanced scheduling and status overviews which help restaurants reduce energy consumption. Rising labor costs will definitely affect your business. While you may be tempted to trim your staff, refrain from doing so as this will affect your customer experience and your brand reputation in the long run. Instead, consider the above to offset your rising labor expense so that your restaurant is able to thrive in the long run. Looking for ways to streamline your hiring process?

Most have been forced to change their business model to fit into the new normal brought upon them by the COVID-19 pandemic. The quick-service restaurant (QSR) industry, in particular, had to modify its business strategy to meet the changing needs of the public. Dine-in arrangements, for one, have been kept to a minimum as customers prefer having their meals at home. As a result, QSR staff are required to focus more on contactless services such as fulfilling orders through deliveries, drive-thru or curbside pick-up. With all these changes taking place, how then will the workplace trends in the hourly space differ from the previous years? Read on as we uncover some of the top trends you can find in the hourly workspace in 2021! Staying Relevant As a QSR owner, you would want to stay abreast with the current trends in the industry as this will help you attract quality candidates for the job positions you are hiring for. Moreover, you do not want to appear outdated to prospective workers as this may affect your company’s image of being a progressive organization. Hourly job-seekers prefer their hiring process to be as simple as possible and streamlining it will probably make them more appreciative of the company they are applying for. At Workstream, we help you automate your backend hiring processes and reduce your time-to-hire by up to 70%. Our streamlined hiring workflow also makes it easy for applicants to apply for job positions in your company, creating a pleasant experience during their hiring process. As the industry transforms due to the pandemic, it is needless to say that trends and needs in the hourly workspace will also change quite a fair bit. Amidst the new trends that have emerged, there are a few others that have been present for quite some time and are here to stay. Here are some of the top trends you can follow to remain relevant despite the changing circumstances! Top 7 Hourly Workplace Trends in 2021 1. Remote Hiring As part of the ‘new normal’, hiring practices have changed over the past year as safe distancing measures are put into place. Among others, virtual interviews are becoming more commonly utilized by companies. Instead of inviting a candidate over to the company site for job interviews, sessions are held online through video call applications such as Zoom or Skype. Additionally, mobile training and onboarding are also introduced to new hires in order to minimize contact with their peers before starting their job. This allows them to be equipped with the necessary skills for the job before their first day of work even without physically going to their company for training. At Workstream, we send automated texts to your new hires which contain relevant documents necessary for their onboarding (e.g. policy documents, I-9, W-4 and more). Alerts will also be sent to ensure that the paperwork is complete. We also send handbooks, checklists and training videos through a text message before your employees start their first day of work. Again, SMS reminders are automatically sent to ensure that they complete their mobile training . 2. Health and Safety Prioritization In light of COVID-19, employees are expecting their employees to take extra measures in keeping their workplace clean and sanitized. One of the factors affecting a job seeker’s decision in accepting a position is the safety of the work environment . Just like McDonald’s and Domino’s Pizza , you can also increase the frequency of your hygiene practices and take extra precautionary steps to protect your staff and customers alike. Aside from that, employees are also demanding more from their employers in terms of providing support for their mental health needs . Undoubtedly, the pandemic has resulted in higher stress levels among the staff as they may feel anxious working outside the safety of their homes. Thus, consider partnering with wellness technology companies as it might just help improve the productivity of your employees. 3. Automation and Upskilling Despite the backlash surrounding the elimination of jobs due to automation processes, it is no question that technology is here to stay. In fact, the pandemic may have well accelerated the digital transformation of the industry . While this means that QSRs can provide a faster and more efficient service, companies will also have to provide additional training for current and future employees. This is so that they are able to transition smoothly to the use of these new technologies. The training can also be presented as a form of career growth opportunity, helping you attract more candidates to apply for a position in your company. 4. Flexible Working Hours While this is not something new, we predict that hourly workers are still prioritizing this above everything else. According to research, 26% of jobs were rejected due to the working hours offered as compared to just 10% which was attributed to the salary package received. This trend is expected given that a large proportion of hourly workers comprise students who are juggling both their jobs and school schedules. Thus, consider allowing a little bit of flexibility when it comes to the job rosters of your hourly workers. 5. Push for Higher Minimum Wage The fight for minimum wage has been going on for quite some time as seen from the McDonald’s employees’ protest . And with the stresses that come from the pandemic, we are convinced that the “Fight for $15” movement will go on until the desired outcome is achieved. Moreover, newly-elected president, Joe Biden, has also revealed plans to pass a $15 per hour minimum wage as part of their relief package, though it is uncertain when the higher wage will take into effect. Nevertheless, an increase in hourly wages may be put into action sooner than we think. 6. Increased Value of Hourly Workers In addition to the probable increase of minimum wage, more employers are providing their hourly workers with benefits such as bonuses and paid sick leave . This is becoming more common as companies are regarding the hourly workforce as essential. After the pandemic hit, hourly workers represent 43% of all essential workers in the US. Thus, you can expect hourly workers to be treated like full-time employees when it comes to the value they can add to your organization. 7. Diversity Diversity is an aspect that companies have been striving towards in recent years. With more movements acknowledging the biases faced by marginalized groups, millennial job seekers will likely be more attracted to a diverse organization. Furthermore, having a diverse workforce not only bolsters your company image and boosts employee satisfaction but also brings different perspectives into your organization. In turn, you are able to understand your customers better and provide them with a more satisfactory experience. The pandemic has sparked off many new normals in the industry. To keep your restaurant afloat, keep up to date with the current workplace trends so that you are aware of what today’s workforce requires from employers like you. Consider following the trends above to attract the quality candidate you need for your business. If you are looking for ways to streamline your hiring process, look no further.

With colder weather quickly approaching for most states, restaurant owners are preparing for the first “pandemic winter” of our lifetimes. With the ongoing COVID-19 crisis forcing locations to mostly do business outside, without the right planning and investments the next few months can easily become a make-or-break moment for many pizza shop owners. Right now is the time to prepare as best as you can for the uncertain days ahead. Here are 5 ways your restaurant or restaurant chain can prepare for this unusual winter. 1. Hire Seasonal Workers Quickly Despite high unemployment, the race to hire seasonal workers is starting right now. The most in-demand employees? Delivery workers, which is troubling for pizza shop owners that need more delivery drivers during the winter months. With every business pivoting to online shopping and delivery, these employees are predicted to be tough to hire in just a few more weeks. Hiring quickly is usually difficult -- even before the pandemic. For instance, Tara Lindstrom, a franchise owner of Pieology mentioned: “By far hiring is our top challenge in the restaurant industry. Not only getting qualified applicants but getting back to them in a timely manner before they accept a job somewhere else. The managers work the line during lunch and dinner. And so by the time they call them back, they might have taken another position.” With a larger pool of candidates, the job of sifting through hundreds if not thousands of unqualified applicants can be a chore for you and your team. As seasonal hiring ramps up, you will want to get ahead of the curve by taking stock of your current hiring funnel and see if you can speed it up in any way. Consider adopting automated hiring solutions to increase the speed of your hiring process. 2. Prepare for Cold Weather Outdoor Dining… and Indoor If your location has an outdoor dining area, there are some obvious preparations to make. If you haven’t yet, invest in outdoor heaters as they are selling out fast across the country . Setting up insulated tenting can help as well, but keep in mind that the entire point of outdoor dining is to have adequate airflow to disperse the coronavirus. Most cities require that at least 50 percent of the sides must be open for airflow. It’s also important to keep in mind the smaller details that come with this new outdoor setup. Your city will have restrictions on the type of heaters that can be used. Owners may need to buy more fire extinguishers to cover the outdoor spaces. The seating area should be mapped out to ensure enough distance between the new heaters and other objects (ie. the temporary tenting). And finally, your waitstaff needs to be trained on operating the heaters, detecting leaks and malfunctions, as well as how to operate in weather that may be slippery or snowy. While the outdoor dining requirements are one thing, owners should keep an eye on the latest news on indoor dining. Just recently, cities like San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and New York have allowed for more indoor capacity . As the weather gets colder, and if virus cases remain low, it’s possible that indoor capacity will continue to rise. So owners should prepare for more indoor seating as well, and not spend all their time and resources on their outdoor dining. 3. Put Staff and Customer Safety Above All Else The absolute worst case scenario for your pizza chain would be to spend thousands preparing for a COVID-19 winter, then having to shut down for weeks due to a single positive case. It simply isn’t worth dropping your guard, even if cases in your town are low. All it takes is one. It’s incredibly important to be diligent about keeping your location safe and secure. It starts with training your staff to stay safe in and out of your restaurant. Gently reminding them that if one of them gets sick, then the entire team suffers is an important talk to have. Keep up sanitation efforts, get rid of anything customers would reuse (ie. swap out menus for QR codes), and enforce the wearing of masks whenever guests are not seated at their tables. It’s clear that there are differing opinions on masks, social distancing, and the virus itself; but as a business owner, it all comes down to making a business decision. City officials are taking contact tracing seriously and closing down restaurants all the time for violating pandemic restrictions. By staying vigilant and putting your staff and guests first, your location will have the best chance of staying open when others can’t. 4. Double Down on Digital While many restaurants are going out of business, Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) are actually thriving during the pandemic. Pizza, in particular, has seen increased sales basically across the board as consumers look for convenient, low-cost meals that have the added benefit of being comfort food during these troubling times. During winter, consumers will opt even more for pickup and delivery. Savvy pizza store owners should make investments into these areas of their business. Domino’s, who heavily invested into the digital side of their business with better mobile apps and online experience, is seeing double digit growth in their revenue. Taking cues from them, is your mobile ordering experience a good one? Now might be the time to update and upgrade your website. Another idea is to make pickup easier with dedicated 5-minute parking spots for picking up, or even converting multiple parking spots to be “pick up only” areas where your staff runs out the order to your customers. Little Caesars have had great success with their pizza lockers for years, and their investment almost seems precinct for today’s consumer behavior. A scan of their phone to open the locker, and it’s a convenient, completely contactless way for their meal to be picked up at their leisure. 5. Market These New Innovations Budgets are tight, but unless your customers know about your location’s updates, it will be tough to reap any benefits from your investments. To keep costs low, leverage social media to spread word of your newly heated outdoor patio, or your commitment to safe indoor dining, or new digital delivery options. Managing your social media campaign doesn’t have to take up your time or be too expensive. Part time social media managers range between $20 to $50/hour , and contracting an expert for just a few hours a week to run awareness campaigns on Instagram and Facebook can pay off. Word of mouth is the ultimate marketing tool of course, as is repeat business. Starting a loyalty program offering discounts and freebies to repeat customers and referrals is an extremely cost-effective way to bring in more business during the winter. And finally, be honest about your predicament. Despite these rough times, communities are banding together to help local businesses all the time . Asking the community to support your restaurant can raise awareness and bring more locals to your door or website. The coming winter will undoubtedly take a toll on many businesses, especially in the restaurant industry. But there are obstacles that we can see coming, that you can tackle today to put your pizza chain in the best possible position to succeed and weather the storm.

What UBI Means for Jobs Share this article “The future without jobs will come to resemble either the cultivated benevolence of Star Trek or the desperate scramble for resources of Mad Max.” - Andrew Yang In this week’s post, we consider what Universal Basic Income means for workers, look at CVS's hiring success during COVID-19, and whether we're at the dawn of a new sort of ageism in the workplace due to the pandemic. Will anyone bother working when receiving UBI? Finland says yes. The jury's out on whether the plan to give Americans $2000 a month will get through Congress ( probably not ), but new research on Universal Basic Income has shed light on the trillion dollar question: will people work if they get free money? The recent news out of Finland's experiment with UBI showed that recipients were not only happier, but more likely to work than those on standard unemployment benefits. In short, people on basic income worked an average of 6 days more than those on unemployment, suggesting that UBI doesn't give a disincentive for people to work. This echoes the findings from the annual checks given out to Alaska citizens since 1982 : no less work was done due to free money. The Takeaway : If UBI ever does get passed in America (and we're closer now than ever before due to the novel coronavirus crisis), companies probably won't have to fear a lack of motivated employees to hire. And since Canada has just started a grand UBI stimulus of sorts, we'll have even more data on what it does to the workforce later this year. CVS is a virtual hiring success story. Literally. Not many other businesses can be considered quite as essential as CVS during the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides selling essential groceries and cleaning supplies, their pharmacy system is indispensable during a health crisis. Which is why they decided to hire 50,000 more employees when the pandemic hit. In a matter of days, CVS created a \"virtual talent acquisition process\" which led to hiring about 60,000 employees in record time. So how'd they do it? First, CVS leveraged their partners who experienced heavy lay-offs and furloughs, such as the hospitality industry, to pull from a pool of eager, vetted candidates. CVS also expedited the roll-out of virtual hiring technology including virtual career fairs, virtual interviews, and even virtual job tryouts. With huge motivation to act quickly, CVS executives managed to put in place and execute a hiring strategy that will be the gold standard for companies moving forward. The Takeaway : If CVS can go virtual and move this quickly in hiring, nearly all retail and service businesses can as well. If you're not embracing hiring technology right now, during social distancing, then when? Older workers are being hit hard by unemployment. This is weird. In most periods of high unemployment in America, older workers fared better than their prime-aged counterparts. This is usually attributed to younger workers being more replaceable while older workers had more valuable expertise. But check out this chart from MarketWatch using numbers from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics: It's not immediately clear why older workers are being hit harder during this recession, but the author of the article has a theory: \"older people are more vulnerable\" to the virus and employers are thus more likely to lay-off older workers. If this is indeed true, then older workers have a scary future ahead of them when it comes to employment. When a virus exists that ravages the older population, will businesses take on the risk of hiring a person who may need more sick days, healthcare, and perhaps worse? The Takeaway : This pandemic may be ushering in a new wave of health-related ageism into the workforce. Will Baby Boomers who still want or need to work be turned away until there is a vaccine? It's something the economy will have to figure out soon. Need help hiring the right people? Workstream can help.

As an HR professional for an SMB, what can you do to help minimize the threat to your hourly workforce? Here are a few tips on how you can help protect your employees during this challenging time. 1. Cancel or postpone in-person meetings Due to the wonders of technology, meetings no longer have to be face-to-face. Most meetings can be conducted online via video call, using apps such as Zoom . It may take a bit of adjustments at first, but employees and clients alike are sure to appreciate that this measure is being done for their safety and convenience. 2. Keep lines of communication open Don’t leave your hourly employees in the dark - utilize different platforms to keep them in the loop regarding critical updates. It’s important that your employees feel that you’re paying attention to the crisis and how it can impact them. You can use automated texting, post on the company’s intranet, send out an email newsletter, or fall back on the classic bulletin board. 3. Limit unnecessary travel Postpone any trips, whether local or overseas, until the pandemic has died down. The CDC has issued a list of countries that have a Level 3 Health Notice (meaning there is still widespread transmission), and has also recommended foregoing any group gatherings . That means that conferences, seminars, trade shows, and similar events are temporarily out of the picture. 4. Educate them on self-quarantine and available leave benefits President Trump recently signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act , a new law that aims to alleviate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This is particularly helpful for SMBs as it caters to businesses with no more than 500 employees. Employers can provide paid sick leave to their affected staff, which the federal government will reimburse, following certain guidelines and conditions .  Encourage your employees to utilize this paid leave if they fall under the cited conditions; it will help promote transparency if they don’t need to fear losing their jobs or using up all their leaves due to the virus. 5. Provide a work-from-home option when possible This may not be suitable to all roles, but whenever applicable, offer the option to work remotely. Enabling members of your staff to work from home will help keep the business running even in the face of emergency quarantine measures, cut back on operating costs, and ultimately, maintain employee and customer safety. Remember that your hourly employees are the lifeblood of your business - they are a resource that should be taken care of . As an HR professional, you have a duty to consider their well-being, enforce proper safety protocols, and support the company as a whole in weathering this ongoing crisis.

This means that more and more people will have access to testing by simply rolling down their windows, getting swabbed, and going home to wait for results. The government is currently in the process of organizing these drive-thrus with companies including CVS, Target, Walgreens, and Walmart, and while the details get sorted out, I’ve been working carefully with my team to figure out a plan to help. Workstream has decided to provide our platform for free to these organizations, helping them hire for these incredibly important roles. What do you need to know about these drive-thru test stations? Drive-thru testing was initially started in South Korea, and has since been recognized for both its efficiency and its prevention against putting other patients at risk of contracting coronavirus. As of March 15, 2020, more than 10 states in the US have these testing facilities. However, they are currently impeded by lack of supplies and manpower. In Seattle, the University of Washington School of Medicine had to ask for assistance from qualified individuals, and on a separate occasion, ran out of pipettes. In a recent press conference, the White House announced that protocols will be in place for testing. Prospective patients will need to go through screening online , where they will answer questions about their symptoms. If they match those of COVID-19, users will then be provided with the location of the closest drive-thru facility where they can be tested. There are also other requirements that may be asked of you, depending on the state in which the drive-thru facility is located. For example, in some sites in Florida, tests are done on an appointment-only basis . At drive-thru stations in New Jersey, only people exhibiting coronavirus symptoms will be tested, and you may be asked to present a resident’s ID . In other areas like Spokane, you will need to have a doctor’s referral to be eligible for testing. Some people may receive priority testing , such as: those over 65 who show symptoms, health personnel who have had contact with a patient suspected of having COVID-19, and people with underlying health issues or have fevers above 99.6 degrees. The brave individuals who are the frontliners at these drive-thru testing sites are state health workers, nurses, and members of the U.S. Public Health Services, who will swab people in their cars and then send the samples off for testing, in as short as just ten minutes. Testing at drive-thru stations is free . Although the cost of tests varies , many health insurance companies and Medicare/Medicaid have stated that they would cover the costs of testing. I was also happy to hear that a number of states have agreed to cover the costs without co-pays or deductibles, which is a huge relief to people who do not have health insurance and would not be able to afford the tests otherwise. While initially the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health labs were the only ones approved to execute the testing for the new coronavirus, there are now a handful of commercial labs (including LabCorp, Quest, Roche, and Thermo Fisher) that have been approved to test as well. Other labs are not far behind, like Hologic and Abbott, who are ramping up on their existing testing capabilities. Although tests taken at drive-thru facilities still have to be sent out for analysis, meaning results won’t be available for 3-4 days, this increase in labs will still help to diagnose people more rapidly than ever before. I believe that if we all work together to contribute to the solution, we can make a tremendous difference in slowing, and eventually stopping this epidemic. In the meantime, my team at Workstream is dedicated to helping by offering our service for free for the next three months to all hospitals, healthcare companies, clinics, and coronavirus screening and testing stations. In the midst of all the chaos surrounding coronavirus, it’s important that hiring workers can be a seamless and efficient process so that we can begin to recover, united together as a society.
