With a diverse team, varying schedules, and specific compliance requirements, restaurant owners and managers never run payroll the exact same way. This guide will explore key aspects of corporate payroll services and restaurant payroll management, offering tips and best practices to streamline the process. Understanding restaurant payroll taxes As a restaurant owner or manager, you need to understand the different payroll taxes you‚Äôre responsible for calculating, withholding, and remitting to the government. Here‚Äôs a breakdown: State and local payroll taxes Depending on where your restaurant(s) are located, you may face additional taxes like state disability insurance, workers' compensation, and local occupational taxes. Research your local requirements to avoid penalties and stay compliant. Federal and state income taxes You're responsible for withholding federal and state income taxes based on your employees' W-4 forms and applicable tax tables. Keep up-to-date with any changes in tax brackets, rates, and requirements to ensure accurate calculations and timely remittances. Nearly 30% of businesses have misclassified their employees, often leading to payroll tax issues and penalties. *National Employment Law Project Navigating tip reporting and allocation In the restaurant industry, tips are a significant part of employee compensation. Proper tip reporting and allocation management are crucial for compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and IRS regulations. Let's explore the key aspects of tip management and best practices for streamlining the process. Establish clear tip reporting policies Develop and communicate clear policies for tip reporting to your employees. Include guidelines on how to record and report tips properly and the consequences of not doing so. Regular training and resources will help your staff understand their responsibilities. Use a tip-tracking system or software Implementing reliable tip-tracking software can streamline the process of recording, allocating, and reporting tips. These tools often integrate with your point-of-sale (POS) system, making it easier for employees to input their tips and automatically calculate allocations, reducing errors and saving time. Educate employees on proper tip reporting Regular training sessions ensure employees understand the importance of accurate tip reporting. Use examples and emphasize the consequences of underreporting, such as potential audits and penalties. Regularly review and reconcile tip reports To maintain compliance and identify any discrepancies, regularly review and reconcile your restaurant's tip reports. Compare the reported tips to your sales data and investigate any significant variances. This process helps detect potential issues early on and allows you to take corrective action before they escalate into larger problems. Handling overtime and minimum wage compliance Restaurants often have employees working long hours, making overtime pay common. It‚Äôs essential to track hours accurately and comply with federal, state, and local minimum wage laws, which may vary based on location and employee classification (e.g., tipped vs. non-tipped employees). Let's delve into the key considerations for managing overtime and minimum wage in your restaurant. Accurately tracking employee hours Implement a reliable time-tracking system that integrates with your payroll software to capture hours worked accurately. Encourage consistent clocking in and out and review time records regularly for accuracy. Understanding overtime pay requirements The FLSA requires employers to pay non-exempt employees overtime at 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek. Ensure you classify employees correctly as exempt or non-exempt based on their job duties and compensation structure. Navigating minimum wage laws Minimum wage laws vary by state and locality, and it's crucial to stay informed about the requirements in every area your business operates in. Some states have different minimum wage rates for tipped and non-tipped employees, so be sure to classify your staff accordingly. Regularly review your employees' compensation to ensure they receive at least the minimum wage when their base pay and tips are combined. Maintaining accurate records To protect your restaurant from potential wage and hour disputes, maintain accurate records of your employees' hours worked, pay rates, and overtime compensation. Keep these records for at least three years, as the FLSA requires, and be prepared to provide them in case of an audit or legal challenge. Outsourcing restaurant payroll Given the complexities of restaurant payroll management and its time-consuming nature, many owners outsource this function to specialized providers. Let's explore the benefits of outsourcing payroll and the key considerations when selecting a provider. Increased accuracy and compliance Time savings for restaurant management Access to payroll expertise and support Integration with time tracking, POS, and HR systems Enhanced data security and confidentiality Increased accuracy and compliance Payroll providers have the expertise and resources to ensure accurate calculations and compliance with the latest tax laws and regulations. By outsourcing payroll, you can reduce the risk of errors and penalties associated with improper withholding, reporting, or remittance of taxes. About 70% of small business owners consider payroll taxes to be a significant or moderate burden. * National Federation of Independent Business Time savings for restaurant management Managing payroll in-house can be a significant drain on your time and resources. By outsourcing this function, you can free up valuable time to focus on other critical aspects of running your restaurant, such as menu development, customer service, and marketing. Access to payroll expertise and support Payroll providers offer access to a team of experts who can provide guidance and support when navigating complex payroll issues . They can help you stay informed about changes in tax laws, assist with compliance questions, and provide resources to streamline your payroll processes. Integration with time tracking, POS, and HR systems Many payroll providers offer integration with popular restaurant time tracking, POS, and HR systems . This integration allows for seamless data transfer, reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of errors. Look for a provider to integrate your existing systems to create a more efficient payroll workflow. Enhanced data security and confidentiality Payroll data contains sensitive employee information, such as social security numbers and bank account details. Payroll providers invest in robust security measures and encryption protocols to protect your data from unauthorized access and breaches. By outsourcing payroll, you can benefit from enhanced security and confidentiality, reducing the risk of data loss or theft. When selecting a payroll provider, consider factors such as their experience in the restaurant industry, pricing structure, customer support, and reputation. Request references from other restaurant owners and schedule demonstrations to evaluate the provider's platform and capabilities. Best practices for restaurant payroll management To optimize your restaurant's payroll processes and ensure compliance, consider implementing the following best practices: Maintain accurate employee records and classifications Keep detailed records of your employees' personal information, job roles, compensation, and tax withholding elections. Regularly review and update these records to ensure accuracy and compliance with labor laws. Properly classify your employees as exempt or non-exempt, and ensure that contractors or freelancers are correctly categorized. Hot tip: don‚Äôt do this manually. Using a digital record system saves you time from having to collect and update employee information by pen and paper. Digital systems also easily integrate with your payroll provider, lowering your risk of errors and incorrect reporting. Use a reliable time-tracking system Implement a robust time-tracking system that integrates with your payroll software to accurately capture your employees' hours worked. Train your staff on proper clock-in and clock-out procedures and regularly review time records for accuracy. Consider using biometric or PIN-based systems to prevent time theft and buddy punching. Regularly review and audit payroll reports Establish a schedule for reviewing and auditing your payroll reports to identify any discrepancies or errors. Compare your payroll data to your time tracking records, tip reports, and sales data to ensure consistency and accuracy. Investigate any variances and take corrective action promptly to avoid potential legal issues or financial losses. Stay updated on changes in tax laws and regulations Tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and it's essential to stay informed about any updates that may impact your restaurant's payroll processes. Regularly review publications from the IRS, the Department of Labor, and your state's tax agency to ensure compliance with the latest requirements. Consider subscribing to industry newsletters or attending webinars to stay informed about best practices and regulatory changes. Provide employee training on payroll policies and procedures Educate your employees on your restaurant's payroll policies and procedures, so they clearly understand their rights and responsibilities. Conduct regular training sessions to review tips reporting, time tracking, and paystub interpretation. Encourage open communication and provide resources for employees to ask questions or raise concerns about their pay. Consider implementing a payroll calendar Set up a payroll calendar that highlights key dates for submitting time records, processing payroll, and distributing paychecks. Share this calendar with your employees and managers so everyone knows when things need to be done. Sticking to this schedule helps keep everything running smoothly and ensures that everyone gets paid on time without any hiccups. Leverage technology and automation Make your restaurant's payroll process a breeze by embracing technology and automation. Use payroll software that syncs with your time tracking and POS systems to cut down on manual data entry and reduce mistakes. Look for features like direct deposit, electronic pay stubs, and employee self-service portals to boost efficiency and give your staff a smoother experience. Conclusion Managing restaurant payroll can be tricky. You‚Äôre juggling compliance, accuracy, and timeliness all at once. By getting a handle on payroll taxes, tip reporting, overtime, and minimum wage rules, you set a strong base for your payroll processes. Thinking about outsourcing? It can really lighten your load by bringing in expert help and advanced tech to streamline the process. Just remember, even if you outsource, keep an eye on your payroll data regularly to ensure everything‚Äôs spot-on and compliant. To keep things running like clockwork, focus on best practices: maintain precise records, use reliable time-tracking systems, provide employee training, and take advantage of technology. This approach can make your payroll management more efficient and compliant. Investing time and resources into effective payroll management not only shields your restaurant from legal and financial hiccups but also shows you care about your employees' well-being. Prioritizing payroll can lead to a happier team, lower turnover, and, ultimately, the long-term success of your restaurant.

Whether you have a single location, a dozen, or more, your approach to payroll has a significant downstream impact on how your business operates 24/7‚Äînot just on payday. This is especially true for companies that employ an hourly workforce, since correcting timesheets can take hours, and any mistake can result in a costly fine. Hourly payroll can get complicated. Fast. So, how are owners and operators navigating payroll in 2024? We asked this question to a group of 250 business owners, HR managers, and others who spend their days managing hourly workers. Our goal? Learn about all things hourly payroll‚Äîstrategies, challenges, and shortcomings.¬† While several themes emerged, one primary takeaway came through again and again and again: most businesses that employ hourly workers are spending too much time and energy on payroll, thanks to an over-reliance on outdated solutions, manual processes, and disjointed tools. We created The State of Hourly Payroll to share the results from our survey with you in a digestible format. We dive into the data and unpack the biggest challenges across the most common payroll methods used by hourly businesses and how you can overcome them. Most importantly, we also include suggestions‚Äîbacked by the recommendations of your peers‚Äîto help you increase the speed and accuracy of each hourly payroll run. Payroll problems ‚â† payroll problems While repetition can make payroll seem ‚Äúsimple,‚Äù there are a lot of details that need to come together for a successful hourly payroll run. Next time you sit down to run payroll, make a note of every step. Each detail. Every potential mistake. A few of these important factors include: Variable hours Employees working different positions across different locations Time off requests Tipping Different regulations between different countries or states The longer the list becomes, the more time each hourly payroll run takes. But what specifically is taking up the most time? And what are the biggest problems presented by these challenges? Survey respondents ranked the most time-consuming aspects of running hourly payroll In the past 6 months, what are the top 3 problems you have faced when running hourly payroll? Notice anything? The biggest challenges faced when running hourly payroll have nothing to do with actually getting paychecks printed or direct deposit‚Ä¶ deposited. The primary obstacles all have to do with making sure data is accurate before it gets to payroll . As an example, let‚Äôs dive into the issue of inaccurate clock-ins and clock-outs. When workers don‚Äôt clock in and out at the right time, small inaccuracies are introduced into the process. This can impact compliance with labor laws regarding overtime, breaks, and shift lengths. Since correcting timesheets often requires double-checking with employees or supervisors, the whole process is slowed down by just a few small inaccuracies. Each platform or tool included in your payroll process increases the risk of additional inaccuracies. Each manual transfer or re-entry of data is one more opportunity for something to go wrong‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a simple typo, a miscalculated hour, or a missed update. These small errors can quickly add up, leading to bigger problems like incorrect pay, regulatory non-compliance, and disgruntled employees. Become an hourly payroll pro: Ask yourself (and anyone else in your organization involved in the process) what the most challenging aspects of running payroll are. Then, take inventory of the associated platforms and processes and look for opportunities to consolidate. Doing so will streamline your workflow, reduce the risk of data entry errors, and cut the time required for each payroll run. The case for consolidating payroll-adjacent tools Historically, [the payroll process] took me six to seven hours every day‚Äîeverything from equitable tip distributions to ensuring the right deductions and benefits. Now, I run payroll in an hour. That is such a quality of life improvement. The time saving has been innumerable. - Christian Bankhead, Crumbl Franchise Partner Control vs. efficiency vs. accuracy When weighing different payroll options, many hourly businesses face a tough decision: maintain control by keeping it in-house or gain efficiency by outsourcing the process. In almost all accounts, our survey respondents struggled to achieve a satisfactory balance between control, efficiency, and accuracy. Control Many organizations (55.5% of respondents) prefer to keep hourly payroll processes in-house to maintain a higher level of control. And of those, 23% are relying on manual methods like spreadsheets. Handling hourly payroll internally brings the benefit of being able to tailor the process to their specific needs. But control comes at a cost. 22.22% of respondents using spreadsheets cited incorrect or disorganized data as a top issue. Additionally, 30% of those employing in-house methods spend more than 5 hours per pay period on payroll-related tasks . Efficiency On the other side of the coin, 38.9% of our respondents choose to outsource their payroll to accountants or payroll services. Of those that use external payroll services, 70% spend 3 hours or less on payroll per pay period. 38.9% choose to outsource payroll While outsourcing hourly payroll can definitely save time, it‚Äôs not without its challenges. One of the biggest potential downsides is a lack of control and visibility. When someone else is handling the payroll for hourly workers, it can be harder to catch issues like incorrect clock-ins or missed breaks, which can lead to inaccuracies that affect both compliance and employee satisfaction. Additionally, relying on external services probably means that your payroll is disconnected from the rest of your HR platforms, so you‚Äôre on the hook to constantly move data between systems to manage time tracking, scheduling, and more. Not only does this mean an increased risk of errors, but it can actually reduce the very efficiency you‚Äôre trying to gain by choosing outside payroll help in the first place . Balancing control and efficiency Survey respondents who kept their payroll in-house reported the highest variation in time spent on hourly payroll, with significant percentages spending anywhere from less than 1 hour to more than 10 hours. This variability highlights how crucial it is to choose the right payroll solution for your needs and priorities. Based on the results of our survey, which payroll solution seems to provide the best balance between control, efficiency, and accuracy? Internal payroll software . But a word of warning: they are not all built the same. The best payroll software should be intuitive, easy to navigate, and tailored to handle the specific challenges of managing hourly workers. Look for software that automates time-consuming tasks like reviewing timesheets, calculating withholdings, and staying compliant with labor laws. It should also integrate seamlessly with your other HR tools so all your data flows smoothly from one step to the next, reducing the need for manual entry and minimizing the risk of errors. Become an hourly payroll pro: The right solution will not only save you time but also empower you to manage payroll with confidence and ease. If your current payroll solution isn‚Äôt actively making your life easier, it might be time to start shopping around. Not just any payroll provider will do ‚Äú Workstream Payroll has made me more efficient because I‚Äôm not manually inputting everybody in the system. They type everything in, we just have to verify their documents. I don‚Äôt have to go back and forth between websites. I just click a button.‚Äù - Cullen James, Jimmy John‚Äôs franchise owner 2025: The year of integrated payroll To stay competitive in 2025 and beyond, hourly businesses are increasingly integrating their HR and payroll systems in order to work smarter and more efficiently. Those that rely on manual or outdated processes risk spending too much time and resources on administrative tasks, making it harder to hire and retain staff, deliver excellent customer service, and scale their operations. An inclination for integration 73.6% of respondents said it would be valuable or extremely valuable to streamline hiring, onboarding, time tracking, and payroll into a single platform. Notably, 64% of respondents also stated it is very or extremely important that their payroll platform meets the needs of employing an hourly workforce, which includes managing multiple positions, varying hours, and compliance. 73.6 want hiring, onboarding, time tracking, and payroll in a single platform 64% want a payroll platform built for the hourly workforce Seeking support With such complexity lurking in hourly payroll (compliance, labor laws, etc.), customer support is paramount. 66.5% of respondents said it‚Äôs very or extremely important that their payroll provider offers a great support experience. 66.5% say it's important that their payroll provider offer great customer support Support for hourly payroll is absolutely critical because payroll isn‚Äôt just about numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs about people. When issues arise, like a mistake in someone‚Äôs paycheck or a compliance question that needs immediate attention, it‚Äôs essential to receive fast, expert help. Unfortunately, too many providers either aren‚Äôt true payroll experts, lack specific expertise in the complexities of hourly payroll or are simply too slow to respond when you need them most. This can leave you scrambling to fix problems on your own, potentially leading to even more mistakes and frustration. In contrast, having timely, knowledgeable support from a provider who truly understands the ins and outs of hourly payroll means you can address issues before they escalate. Benefits of an all-in-one payroll solution Retention: Accurate, on-time payroll builds trust with employees and encourages loyalty. Cost savings: Reducing the time spent on payroll corrections and maintaining compliance lowers labor costs and reduces the risk of fines. Time savings: Streamlined processes can save those running payroll more than 10 hours each month, which can be redirected to customer service, employee development, and other strategic initiatives. Become an hourly payroll pro: Choose a payroll solution that not only integrates with your HRIS, but your hiring and onboarding processes as well. This workflow will allow you to transition between each phase of the employee lifecycle without additional data entry or having to manually export and import files between systems. It‚Äôs time to focus on people again, not admin work ‚ÄúMoving from different platforms with different passwords with different user names and going to different places, to going to only one place‚Ä¶it‚Äôs about getting more time to run the restaurants. The less time I‚Äôm doing admin work, the more time I can be in the restaurants in contact with the customers or in contact with the employees.‚Äù - Marco Acevedo, Bojangles franchisee The future of hourly payroll The data is clear: outdated and disjointed payroll processes are making hourly payroll more difficult than it needs to be. The majority of businesses are struggling with issues that stem from misaligned, manual methods, fragmented systems, and a lack of integration between payroll and essential HR processes like time tracking and compliance management. These inefficiencies lead to more time spent on payroll, higher risks of errors, and increased frustration for both payroll managers and employees. By simplifying your payroll operations and integrating everything into one cohesive system, you can reduce errors, save time, and ensure accuracy‚Äîall while building trust and loyalty with your team.

These dedicated employees are the backbone of our economy, playing critical roles in industries like retail, hospitality, food and beverage, and manufacturing. Yet, when it comes to how they're hired, managed, and paid, employers aren't always equipped with the right technology to take care of their teams. 80% of the global workforce is comprised of hourly workers The challenge? Many businesses are still using the same standard solutions designed for office workers‚Äîtools that simply don't offer the flexibility, ease, and self-service options that an hourly workforce needs. Even more concerning is the fact that some businesses continue to rely on outdated paperwork and manual processes to manage their teams. What is an HR tech stack? To increase your operational efficiency, you need to build a collection of tools (or acquire an all-in-one solution) that helps you digitally manage HR tasks. An HR tech stack helps automate many of the tasks that were once performed manually by human resources teams‚Äîsuch as hiring, onboarding, shift scheduling, time clock management, payroll, and performance evaluation. When it comes to building the right HR tech stack for your business, it's all about prioritizing the features that will make the biggest impact. Start by considering how you currently handle everyday HR tasks, such as how people apply to your open roles or how you pay your hourly workers, and think about how new technology can enhance these processes. By investing in the right tools, you'll not only boost your productivity and save costs but also create a more empowering environment for your hourly workforce. Recruiting and hiring Among hourly workers with less than 12 months on the job, 52% are either actively or passively looking for a change . Making sure your recruiting and hiring process is quick, intuitive, and more accessible can better attract those job seekers. This is where an HR tech stack comes into play. 52% of hourly workers are looking for a job change The job search tactics of hourly workers can differ greatly from their white-collar counterparts. They‚Äôre less risk averse and willing to leave a job without having another one lined up. Working outside an office, they rely almost entirely on their phones as their main form of communication. With the right HR tech, your business can attract more applicants, perform background checks, streamline the orientation process, and get them all up to speed‚Äîready to work from day one. When building your HR tech stack, include these tools to cover your hiring and recruiting needs: Applicant tracking systems (ATS) By offering unique ways to source applicants, an ATS is the backbone of your HR tech stack. It helps manage your overall recruiting and hiring process. Look for a platform like Workstream that can organize and screen job applications, allow applicants to schedule their own interviews, and send automated messages to applicants directly from the platform. Job posting platforms This type of HR tool helps simplify the process of posting your hourly positions to the job boards and sites you already use to recruit workers like Indeed, Monster, JobTarget, and ZipRecruiter. Background check services Whether part of an ATS or its own HR tool, this service allows you to check for criminal histories, driving records, and education/work histories of job seekers, coordinate drug screenings, and more. When integrated with your ATS, background check solutions like Checkr send background check requests automatically to applicants, moving them along in the hiring process if the results satisfy your specific requirements. Onboarding When you‚Äôre ready to turn an applicant into a new hire, onboarding and training tools are essential to providing a smooth experience from day one on. Modern onboarding tools will send offer letters to applicants via text, notify them when it‚Äôs time to complete their new hire paperwork, and make it easy to fill out forms and sign documents from their phones. Time and attendance Gone are the days of time clocks and handwritten schedules‚Äîtoday's hourly workplaces need modern solutions to keep up with the fast-paces demands. Time-tracking tools are no longer just a convenience; they're essential for creating order and ensuring smooth operations. For workers, a dependable time-tracking system offers peace of mind. They can easily confirm or request updates to their timesheet, ensuring their paychecks are accurate and that they're being fairly compensated for their time. It gives managers visibility into who's starting, ending, or covering shifts as planned, helping them keep the business appropriately staffed to meet demand, manage labor cost expectations, and run payroll accurately. For managers, reviewing, correcting, and approving timesheets can feel like a full-time job. It's time-consuming and can lead to errors that cost your business, especially when payroll mistakes or overtime issues arise. A reliable time-tracking system helps streamline this process, making it easier to spot and fix discrepancies before they become costly problems. Plus, it provides a clear and accurate record of breaks and overtime, helping you stay compliant with labor laws and avoid any legal headaches. Shift Scheduling No matter how good an organization or manager is at shift scheduling, it‚Äôs impossible to plan for all the unexpected situations or life events that get in the way. Employees get sick. Cars break down. Half your staff buys tickets to the same concert on the same night. When those little things prevent shifts from running smoothly, does your staff manager have to get involved to fill gaps in your schedule, or can hourly workers simply swap shifts among themselves? With the right tools in your HR tech stack, you can empower your hourly workers to swap shifts when it‚Äôs necessary, overcome scheduling conflicts, and help your business stay staffed without the stress. When setting up your HR tech stack, turn to app-based software for your shift scheduling needs: Time-tracking software Built with hourly work in mind, time-tracking software can automate all three components of time-tracking: time entry, approvals, and reporting. Instead of hourly workers manually clocking their time in and time out, it can be done electronically using software-based systems‚Äîproviding convenience while also reducing inaccuracies. Besides timesheet approval and payroll processing, time tracking tools also help you better understand performance, labor cost budget, and compensation. Shift management tools Whether managing shifts at fixed locations or overseeing employees offsite, these types of software solutions enable everyone to stay current on shift details, schedule changes, and status updates. Hourly workers can swap shifts using an app, rather than having back-and-forth conversations via text messages or phone calls‚Äîall while managers still retain authority to approve or deny shift swaps. Scheduling tools For effective communication between workers at all levels at your workplace, it's critical to create and post schedules as far in advance as possible. Which is why any tech stack would benefit from the ability to inform employees about their shifts, let them confirm their availability, request time off, and let the managers adjust shifts accordingly. Payroll and benefits administration When it comes to your HR tech stack, payroll might just be the most important piece, especially if you're managing an hourly workforce. The complexities of hourly payroll‚Äîlike fluctuating hours, different roles, various locations, and overtime‚Äîmean it's crucial to have a system designed to handle these challenges. Errors in payroll can be incredible costly, not just financially, but in terms of compliance and employee trust. For many hourly workers, payday is anything but predictable. They rarely get paid the same amount each time, thanks to the different hours they work, if they work different positions in the same pay period, how many locations they work at, and whether they've clocked in any overtime. This variability is the norm in hourly work, but it adds a layer of complexity to payroll that can't be ignored. Compliance is another critical factor. Making a mistake in how you handle lunch breaks, overtime, or tipping doesn't just lead to unhappy employees‚Äîit can lead to costly legal issues. Labor laws are strict, and staying on top of them is non-negotiable. Every aspect of payroll must align with these laws to avoid penalties and ensure your business is on the right side of the law. Correcting all this information every payroll run is not only time-consuming but also puts you at risk for errors, especially if you're copying and pasting data from one tool to another. That's why the most beneficial payroll solution for an hourly business is an all-in-one platform. A system that includes time tracking, shift scheduling, employee records, and more, all seamlessly integrated with payroll, helps you stay compliant, accurate, and efficient‚Äîevery single payday. When selecting your HR tech stack, consider these tools for your payroll and benefits needs: Payroll software Too many hourly businesses either manage payroll by hand or use software designed to serve white collar workers with too many features they don't need and not enough of the ones they do. Look for software built for hourly that automatically flags errors, keeps your compliant, offers fast, expert support, and integrates seamlessly with your HR and time-tracking systems. Benefits enrollment and management platforms This HR technology can help a business maintain employee benefits enrollment, communication, and distribution for its hourly workforce. This is also where employees review, update, and utilize benefits or access forms and documents on a mobile device. Performance management Employee evaluations and performance management play important roles in achieving ongoing success in any workplace. But if you oversee an hourly workforce, you more than likely need a tool that is accessible on-the-go without the cluttered paper files or burdensome spreadsheets. Of course, workplace performance isn‚Äôt limited or measured by employee evaluations alone. It‚Äôs also about helping your people set goals and encouraging friendly competition to reach targets. Performance evaluation software These solutions incorporate brief questions to prompt action while keeping subjectivity or speculation to a minimum. They can provide managers with a foundation for coaching conversations, helping them better lead and grow their teams. The data you collect from this software can help inform your compensation, promotion, and succession planning decisions. And can even keep the lines of communication open via chat. Goal setting and tracking tools This HR technology is often used to inspire productivity, accelerate performance, and increase employee engagement through a combination of gamification, motivational psychology, and activity-based behaviors. Managers can set up personalized goals with metrics or implement leaderboards using progress bars and rankings to motivate teams. Employee experience In the aftermath of the Great Resignation, more businesses now recognize the value of retaining their best employees by prioritizing their professional needs, personal well being, flexible benefit options, and performance feedback. Those who don‚Äôt take care of their people risk losing them. Many among the hourly workforce feel unappreciated by their current employers. One recent survey revealed that 37% of frontline employees were considering leaving their jobs. Emotional issues like burnout were cited among the top factors negatively affecting employee experience. 37% of hourly workers are considering leaving their jobs When creating your HR tech stack, try these tools to address your employee experience needs: Communication tools Chat tools facilitate real-time communication, enabling quick responses to urgent needs and ensuring workers are informed and engaged no matter where they are. A mobile-first solution enhances real-time collaboration and ensures that important messages are delivered promptly, fostering a more efficient and cohesive work environment. Engagement survey tools Using a survey tool to collect feedback from hourly workers offers significant benefits for businesses. It allows you to continuously monitor employee satisfaction through various types of surveys, such as pulse, exit, and new hire surveys . This helps employers gather valuable insights into worker morale and engagement, ultimately reducing turnover and fostering a more positive work environment. Recognition platforms When a workforce feels both appreciated and valued, they tend to enjoy higher levels of job satisfaction. Businesses that encourage employee recognition experience reduced turnover rates and greater productivity. Recognition platforms allow workers and managers alike to recognize each other via eCards, award nominations, and other forms of positive reinforcement and company-wide acknowledgement‚Äîwith any mobile device. This can include the celebration of employee birthdays as well as career anniversaries. 360 feedback systems These HR tools enable you to measure and track employee performance in key skills all through a mobile device. Managers can identify (and understand) skill gaps over time to improve team dynamics, better allocate training budgets, and adjust future hiring plans. These solutions give workers access to an open channel of communication to provide direct feedback to managers or further up the chain of command as needed. Compliance and reporting According to a study conducted at the height of the global pandemic, 65% of hourly workers say they hadn‚Äôt been provided with any additional technology to complete their jobs. An even greater number, 91%, said they wanted better training‚Äî which included safety and compliance. 65% of hourly workers don't have the tech they need to do their jobs 91% want better technology Failing to comply with company policies, procedures, and regulations could result in hefty fines for employees, owners, and businesses. But with a hourly workforce, ensuring that every employee is in compliance with the rules and requirements that govern your industry can prove challenging. Measuring, then analyzing, the productivity of your hourly workers can be just as difficult. It first starts with figuring out which specific things need to be measured. Different businesses can have different definitions of productivity. Should your KPI be the number of jobs completed in a given day, week, or month? Is response time in the field your metric? Is it customer satisfaction? Without the right tools, uncovering efficiencies to improve productivity in a timely manner can be a tedious process. Especially if your employees work independently or without direct oversight. There‚Äôs also a matter of separating actual work time from travel or administrative tasks. Some of your KPIs can be measured independently. Other KPIs require self reporting or customer input. When selecting your HR tech stack, try these tools for your compliance and reporting needs: Compliance management software This type of HR technology stores all your compliance-related information in one central location, accessible to your employees on their mobile devices‚Äîkeeping them informed on current company policies and procedures. Real-time notifications about activity status (such as incomplete or delayed tasks) remind and encourage users to get in compliance. Look for solutions that integrate training directly in the tools that your workers already use. Reporting and analytics tools This software incorporates streamlined workflows and modern technologies to schedule, track, monitor, and analyze the performance of shift workers on their mobile devices as they conduct work activities‚Äîgiving you a clear, real-time view of day-to-day operations. This can take the form of customized mobile timesheets, work-related app- or site-usage monitoring, GPS tracking, or daily check-in prompts, often compiled into a visual timeline. Learning management system Traditional training platforms for the workplace are designed for office-bound or centrally located employees. The needs of the hourly workforce are obviously different. On the road or on the job, hourly workers are always on the move. Pulling them off the frontline to train in a classroom or behind a desk is costly and impractical. Yet, your workers crave more education (as evidenced in the previous section by their desire for career advancement). Or need corporate or compliance-based training. With hourly workers, employers and HR managers must find ways to offer training that can be completed anywhere ‚Äîwith all the information they need‚Äîwithout slowing them down at work. When setting up your HR tech stack, use app-based tools for your learning management needs: Digital training tools/programs Look for tools that break up training in short, to-the-point units instead of hour-plus presentations. When critical or time-sensitive information becomes available, some software solutions can send notifications via text to every employee‚Äôs mobile device for added efficiency, rather than waiting until everyone is in the same room to get up-to-date about courses. How you build your tech stack matters 52% of hourly workers claim they would leave their jobs over tech tools. They expect and deserve the same quality experience with HR technology as their white-collar counterparts. 52% of hourly workers would leave their jobs over tech tools Putting together a solid HR tech stack for an hourly workforce takes time, effort, and research. But it doesn‚Äôt have to happen all at once. Whether it‚Äôs the lack of mobile-friendly payroll options for your employees, the need for flexible and accessible shift scheduling, or a gap in compliance training, identify and focus on which HR tools fit your biggest priorities. Know that once the implementation is complete, it will be rewarding and well worth the effort for many reasons. Your HR tech stack can help improve the worker experience, increase overall job satisfaction, and decrease turnover rates‚Äîmaking it that much easier to manage your business.
